0,96,"FAULCONBRIDGE, J; MUZIO, D",2008,Organizational professionalism in globalizing law firms,globalization; legal profession; organizational professionalism; professional autonomy; professional services firms,MANAGEMENT; DYNAMICS; LONDON,"Are the challenges of globalization, technology and competition exercising a dramatic impact on professional practice while, in the process, compromising traditional notions of professionalism, autonomy and discretion? This article engages with these debates and uses original, qualitative empirical data to highlight the vast areas of continuity that exist even in the largest globalizing law firms. While it is undoubted that growth in the size of firms and their globalization bring new challenges, these are resolved in ways that are sensitive to professional values and interests. In particular, a commitment to professional autonomy and discretion still characterizes the way in which these firms operate and organize themselves. This situation is explained in terms of the development of an organizational model of professionalism, whereby the large organization is increasingly emerging as a primary locus of professionalization and whereby professional priorities and objectives are increasingly supported by organizational logics, systems and initiatives.",Work Employ.

Earnings returns to education in urban China,,REFORMING STATE SOCIALISM; INCOME INEQUALITY; SOCIETAL TRANSFORMATION; TRANSITION DEBATE; EASTERN-EUROPE; LABOR-MARKET; DUAL ECONOMY; RURAL CHINA; STRATIFICATION; RUSSIA,"Previous work on the market transition in reform-era China has missed the direct link between individuals' labor market history and individuals' labor market outcome. A typology of workers is developed based on individuals' labor market histories, and a model of selective mobility of workers from the state sector to the market sector is offered as an explanation for higher earnings returns to education in the market sector. Analysis of data from an urban survey in China reveals that commonly observed higher earnings returns to education in the market sector are limited only to recent market entrants, and that early market entrants resemble state workers in both their level of earnings and returns to education. These results challenge the prevailing wisdom that education is necessarily more highly rewarded in the market sector Thus it is concluded that higher returns to education in the market sector should not be construed as being caused by marketization per se, and instead that the sorting process of workers in labor markets helps explain the sectoral differentials.",Am.

This niche is defined by two properties: crowding and status. The authors hypothesize that crowding suppresses an organization's life chances and that status enhances life chances, especially for those organizations in uncrowded niches. They operationalize this conception of the niche using patents and patent citations, and they find support for these hypotheses in an examination of technological competition in the worldwide semiconductor industry. In the conclusion, they compare these findings to earlier research and highlight some of the particular advantages of this conception of the niche.",Am. J. Sociol.

The author introduces a multilevel process theory to understand how these characteristics are generated and transformed over time. The theory assumes that ethnic boundaries are the outcome of the classificatory struggles and negotiations between actors situated in a social field. Three characteristics of a field - the institutional order, distribution of power, and political networks determine which actors will adopt which strategy of ethnic boundary making. The author then discusses the conditions under which these negotiations will lead to a shared understanding of the location and meaning of boundaries. The nature of this consensus explains the particular characteristics of an ethnic boundary. A final section identifies endogenous and exogenous mechanisms of change.",Am. J. Sociol.

Abstracted from its biological connotations, the concept of autopoiesis leads to a sharp distinction between different kinds of autopoietic organization, i.e. between life, consciousness and communication. According to Luhmann, the relationship between social systems and human beings cannot be adequately analysed except by taking into account that they are environments for one another. If this theoretical background is accepted, the concepts and theory of socialization need to be revised. Luhmann takes issues with classical notions such as internalization, inculcation, or 'socialization to the grounds of consensus' (Talcott Parsons). After a historical overview of social systems research and general systems theory, it is indicated how communications trigger further communications and realize the autopoiesis of social systems. In the second part of the article, the distinction between social systems and psychic systems is used to discuss issues crucial to socialization theory. Both a revision of the concept of socialization, and lines for an empirical research programme are proposed in accordance with Luhmann's theory of social systems.",Br. J. Sociol.

In neonatal intensive care units (NICUs), we argue, the process of sorting and evaluating parents of NICU patients varies with the gender age, and race of the parents and depends on what those characteristics are taken to mean in the context of the organization. We find that social control in the NICU tends to be reintegrative rather than disintegrative. Because NICUs cannot control their organizational borders and because of the fundamental interdependence between medical careproviders and parents, parents must be reformed rather than excluded We conclude that when substantial resources must be expended to correct deviant behavior, an organization will be more reluctant to label anyone as deviant and that when a group is dependent on the participation of deviant members, the group will make considerable effort to rehabilitate them.",Am.

But, if a particular cause could be neutralized, which of these causes would have the strongest effect of reducing social inequality? Based on data of the PISA 2000 study, the contribution argues that the secondary social effect, which mainly represents the parental decisions for transitions to different branches of the higher educational system, has at least the same quantity as the primary social effect, which consists in all family background conditions of a student. Simple simulations show how the social inequality will change, if either the primary or the secondary social effect are neutralized.

Research about ethnic inequality emphasizes that economic stagnation and restructuring are troubling impediments to progress toward equality, and it shows evidence that employers may still use racial and ethnic queues in hiring. A number of issues arise with respect to the incorporation of the new waves of immigrants who have arrived since immigration law reform in 1965. We discuss patterns of adaptation of new immigrants, including available evidence on the ethnic enclave economy and substitution in the labor market of immigrants for native minorities. We summarize new theories and hypotheses about the fate of the children of recent immigrants, and we point to topics in this area needing further research.",Annu. Rev. Sociol.
8,2336,"LAMONT, M",1996,The nature of virtue: Symbolic boundaries in the French and American upper-middle classes,,SCHOOL SUCCESS; UNITED-STATES; PARTICIPATION,"This paper analyzes the social definitions of ''a worthy person'' that predominate in the French and American upper-middle classes. More specifically, it identifies types of symbolic boundaries, i.e. implicit definitions of the ''pure'' and the ''impure'', produced by interviewees when they discuss people who are ''better'' and ''worse'' than - or similar to and different from - themselves. The analysis is based on one hundred and sixty interviews which I conducted with randomly sampled college-educated white male professionals, managers and businessmen living in and around Indianapolis, New York, Paris and Clermont-Ferrand. Three types of boundaries emerge from the interviews: moral, cultural and social boundaries. I compare the relative salience of these boundaries across samples to discover that cultural exclusion, which is the most prominent type of exclusion in French society, is considerably less important in the United States. Americans most frequently draw symbolic boundaries on the basis of worldly success while moral exclusion ist equally salient in both societies. These findings bring a new dimension to the cultural capital literature as they indicate that traits other than command of high culture are central to the upper-middle class. These findings are also indicative of differences in broad national cultural patterns in France and the United states.",Berliner J. Soz.

Our analysis provides a more complex assessment of the hypothesis that racial differences in transitions to first marriage reflect shortages of marriageable men in local marriage markets. We attach several indicators of local marriage market conditions (primarily sex ratios from the 1980 Census) to women's marital histories available in the 1979 through 1986 waves of the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth. Our discrete-time logit models support the following conclusions: (1) A shortage in the quantity and quality of available males in local areas depresses women's transitions to first marriage; (2) economic independence among women (as measured by employment and earnings) is positively associated with entry into marriage; (3) racial differences in mate availability account for a relatively small share of existing racial differences in marriage; (4) indicators of local mate availability nevertheless account for a larger proportion of observed racial differences in transitions to first marriage than factors such as family background, welfare status and living arrangements (e.g., multigenerational family); (5) the effects of marriage market characteristics are contingent on whether women are ''searching'' in the marriage market; and (6) the effect of a shortage of ''economically attractive'' men is not simply an artifact of local demographic deficits of men to marry.",Am.

A reply to the paper of Christian Etzrodt",Alfred Schutz; definition of the situation; rational choice theory; bounded rationality; frame-selection,,"The paper is a reply to the critique of Christian Etzrodt in two points, where he was discussing the model of frame-selection which I formulated following some suggestions of Alfred Schutz on the problem of bounded rationality: (1) The model does not exclude at all the processes of the ""interactive"" and symbolic constitution of social situations; (2) it does in no way rely on the ""rationality"" of the actors alone. It does, however, assume quite a different mechanism to the assumption of ""calculativeness"", usually associated with subjected-expected-utility theory, despite it is based on certain formal assumptions of this theory. The core of the framing-concept is the ""match"" of typical properties of the situation (i.e. ""symbols"") with socially shared mental models, which are part of the identity of the actors. Quite different to the assumptions of Etzrodt, the model thus systematically takes into account the ""meaning"" of social action and the strength of culture in defining a situation.",Koln. Z. Soziol.

A number of key variations in women's labour market position, for example, participation rates, part-time, temporary work and unemployment rates, are examined and in each area it is found that there are substantial differences in the patterns of women's economic activity. A contribution is also made to the debate on the non-standard or flexible workforce by focusing on the issue of recent changes in labour market deregulation in the two countries and the importance of the informal economy in Spain. In both countries the state has pursued policies of deregulation of the labour market to produce a more flexible workforce. Employers have drawn on a hidden labour supply of married women who in turn have been incorporated into the economy through forms of non-standard work, in the UK this has been part-time work and in Spain either temporary work or irregular or illegal forms of work in the informal economy. It is argued that these developments may have negative consequences for both countries with respect to training, skill and wage levels.",Work Employ. Soc.

An analysis of the use of strategic power helps explain why exchange partners in previous research have rarely used coercive power even wizen their incentives and capacities to coerce were high. Using power is risky, and actors fear losses from the potential retaliation of their partners far more than they value the prospect of increased rewards. The risks of coercive power use are especially great in the context of relations of mutual exchange because of the high reward dependence of actors who have the strongest incentive to use coercion. Two experiments show that when risk is reduced, particularly the risk of reward loss, both the use of coercion and the effects of variations in the structure of coercive power increase.",Am. Sociol.

Wage growth is examined in the differences of the log of hourly wage rates reported at the 33 and 42 year old interviews of this cohort study. Men were found to have higher wage growth rewards than women when in higher occupations and be more likely than women to be in these higher wage growth occupations. Women's wages grew more slowly over the period than men's wages because they were located disproportionately in lower growth and feminized jobs. Domestic ties did not explain the differences in wage growth for this group, where the occupational penalties of gender widened.",Work Employ. Soc.
14,1174,"CROMPTON, R",2002,"Employment, flexible working and the family",gender; family; flexible employment; modernity; capitalism,WELFARE-STATE; GENDER; BRITAIN,"This paper assesses some of the implications of one of the major social changes to have taken place in the West during the second half of the twentieth century - that is, the increased employment of women, together with normative changes in gender relations and in women's expectations. These changes have been linked to an increase in individualism, which itself is associated with the transcendence of 'first modernity'. Thus it is suggested that new approaches to social analysis are required (Beck). Here it is argued that, rather than develop completely new approaches in order to grasp the changes that are under way, the 'economic' and the 'social' (that is, employment and the family) should be seen as intertwined, rather than approached as separate phenomena. Past debates in feminism, changes in the family, and flexible employment are critically examined. The growing tensions between employment and family life are discussed. It is argued that these changes are associated with the intensification of capitalist development, rather than reflecting a fundamental transformation of society. Existing approaches to the analysis of social change, including Polanyi's analysis of the development of 'counter-movements' against the 'self-regulating' market, will, therefore, still be relevant to our enquiries. In the concluding section, a programme of research that would examine these changes is outlined.",Br. J. Sociol.

Compared with other couples, those with stepchildren reveal a lower probability to become a First common child. The investigations show that this is due solely to the higher age of women in stepfamilies and not to the existence of stepchildren. Different possibilities to explain the indiscrimination between rates of First birth when age is controlled are discussed. Additional research shows a negative impact of stepchildren on the process of family-expansion, which is traced back to the higher total number of children reached with a further birth in stepfamilies. However, under the condition of equal total number of children stepchildren show a positive effect on couples' fertility.",Koln. Z. Soziol. Sozialpsych.

The first moment that will be examined here is the process whereby homosexual acts were decriminalized in the 1950s and 1960s; here special attention will be paid to the recommendations made by the Wolfenden Committee. The second moment is one we are currently experiencing, which is associated with the inclusive policing of sexual minority communities (especially lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender communities) under the provisions of the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 and in the review of Sex Offences, especially in the consultation paper (Home Office 2000) and White Paper (Home Office 2002) associated with this review. Privacy and toleration dominate the first moment, at the same time it shall be demonstrated that privacy is also central to the British Sexual Citizenship literatures that have emerged in sociology in the post-Wolfenden context. However, as the title suggests, the second moment under examination points to the emergence of a rather more extensive sexual minority citizenship beyond the boundaries of 'homosexual privacy' (which British Sexual Citizenship Studies is not currently engaging with) and perhaps even beyond the boundaries of toleration through ever more 'inclusive' policing strategies and through the review of sex offences in which many discriminatory laws are being 'de-homosexualized'.",Br.

The other is to assess the overall development of the field. Major advances can be observed in four areas: national individual-level longitudinal databases, the impact of institutional contexts on life courses, life courses under conditions of societal ruptures, and health across the life course. In four other areas, advancements have been less pronounced: internal dynamics and causal linkages across life, the interaction of development and socially constructed life courses, theory development, and new methods.

Hiroshi Orihara accepts this distinction bur argues that the manuscript written before the war built already an integrated whole with a conceptual apparatus to be found in the essay on ""Ueber einige Kategorien der verstehenden Soziologie"". Therefore, this essay should be put on top of the manuscript. Contrary to his contentions it is maintained that neither the references in and between the manuscripts nor the concepts used throughout them nor even the proposed systematic arguments cannot prove Or;hara's case.

Applying a ""double cohort"" method for longitudinal analysis with census data, we clarify the effects of economic restructuring and economic assimilation. We investigate multiple temporal effects: immigration cohort, birth cohort, age at migration, duration in the United States, and advancing age. The analysis compares Latinas in southern California who are employed in low-wage factory jobs,vith Latinas employed in better-paying office jobs. Results indicate sharp temporal differentiation among the Latina workers, even after controlling for human capital. The newest arrivals concentrate in the growing light-manufacturing sector and remain there, to a relative degree, across subsequent decades. Workers who immigrated as young children (referred to as the 1.5 generation) diverge from their parents and tend to be employed in office jobs-a pattern similar to young native-born Latinas. Within cohorts' careers, workers shift out of factors jobs, but there is little net shift into office work. instead cohort succession is the dominant factor in workers' adaptation to a changing economic structure.",Am.

Under these conditions, the risk and uncertainty of exchange provide the opportunity for partners to demonstrate their trustworthiness. This study develops the theoretical implications of this proposition and conducts an experimental test that compares levels of both trust and commitment in two forms of direct exchange, negotiated and reciprocal.

Data from a first-of-its-kind 25-city survey suggest that political embeddedness, defined broadly as bureaucratic, instrumental, or affective ties to the state and its actors, helps Chinese lawyers survive their everyday difficulties, such as routine administrative interference, official rent seeking, and police harassment and intimidation. The article draws the ironic conclusion that legal practice in China reveals at least as much about the enduring salience of socialist institutions as it does about incipient capitalist and ""rule of law"" institutions. Lawyers' dependence on state actors both inside and outside the judicial system preserves the value of political connections inside the very institutions that some sociologists have argued are responsible for obviating the need for such guanxi.",Am.

Yet, there is little empirical support for this assumption. To address this gap in the literature, this study draws on an extensive investigation of the relationship between differential socialization and differential religiousness. Using the American General Social Surveys and the World Values Survey, this article analyzes the relationship between traditional gender attitudes and gender differences in religious beliefs and behavior. Surprisingly, these data show no relationship between the two. Therefore, a new set of hypotheses based on an alternative model involving risk preference is proposed. Results strongly support this new approach. Women are more religious than men to the extent that being irreligious constitutes risk-taking behavior. This model is able to predict differential religiousness in a wide variety of religious and cultural settings. Implications of these findings are discussed.",Am. J. Sociol.

Based on neurophysiological discoveries of brain-behavior mechanisms at work in attachment, the theoretical model provides a nonreductionistic understanding of how biological forces constrain social interaction and yield effects that propagate beyond dyads into wider social networks. The network effects of the model are equivalent to patterns long recognized in sociological research on personal networks, showing that the model can reproduce empirically familiar and sometimes surprising bottom-up discoveries about network dynamics. Additionally, the model provides sociological theory with a straightfoward computational approach to discovering how deep structural principles at work in all complex systems also yield a social architecture-specifically, how a system/subsystem architecture; first described by Herbert Simon, emerges when strong interactions partition persons into naturally occurring subsystems.",Am.

We examine this for Catholic-Protestant intermarriage in the Republic of Ireland. We use a multivariate analysis on survey data to test the hypotheses that urban dwellers, persons of non-farming parents, persons with higher levels of education and the young are more likely to be religiously intermarried. While the odds of being in an intermarriage are greater for urban dwellers, this is in large part due to their being non-farmers. The farming effect is not necessarily related to religiosity. The odds of being in an intermarriage do not increase significantly for persons with third level education and this can be explained in terms of the marriage market for minority groups. It is shown that the historical context and the minority position of religious group should be taken into account in explanations which relate modernization to the pattern of religious intermarriage.",Br.

The love literature in the 17,h century produced not only this culture capital but was in the same time a base for the emancipation of women and the integration of the non-aristocratic author in the field of power.

I demonstrate that public school students in states with large private school sectors have improved educational outcomes. Contrary to assumptions underlying the school-choice movement, however; the improved performance of public school students is not the result of increased organizational efficiency, but instead is the product of increased resources provided to public schools. The state thus takes an active role in protecting public sector providers.

The author develops and tests a set of propositions isolating processes of performance-reward bias, whereby women and minorities receive less compensation than white men with equal scores on performance evaluations. Using personnel data from a large service organization, the author empirically establishes the existence of this bias and shows that gender, race, and nationality differences continue to affect salary growth after performance ratings are taken into account, ceteris paribus. This finding demonstrates a critical challenge faced by the many contemporary employers who adopt merit-based practices and policies. Although these policies are often adopted in the hope of motivating employees and ensuring meritocracy, policies with limited transparency and accountability can actually increase ascriptive bias and reduce equity in the workplace.",Am.

Parsons' theses on theory building and Alexander's redirectioning of some of its fundamental tenets are discussed. It is shown that Alexander's ideas are consistent with the so-called post-positivist philosophy of science that is linked to Popper and Kuhn, but that he is oblivious to other strands that are much more in tune with Parsons' first approach to the issue. Bachelard, Piaget and Bhaskar furnish elements that account better, both factually and normatively, for the coupling of empirical data and theory in the sciences in general and in sociology in particular, than Alexander's, Popper's and Kuhn's perspectives. They offer the underpinnings for a dialectical epistemology, which can relinquish the principle of uniformity or determinism, dealing with creativity and the fluidity of social life, without giving up general theories, concepts and causal correlations. Concrete controversies are also discussed in order to illustrate this epistemological strategy.",Sociol.-J. Brit. Sociol. Assoc.

Or, does the social origin have an indirect effect on the unequal recruitment only, by means of the unequal participation in the educational system as suggested by the functionalist elite theory?

For the 6.500 engineers, jurists, and economists, who received a doctor's degree in the years of 1955, 1965, 1975, and 1985, the correlation between social origin, educational career, and professional career is analyzed by multivariate methods. The chances of achieving an executive position are 50% higher for individuals with a service class I background and 100% higher for those individuals with an upper class background in contrast to individuals with working class and middle class background, Therefore, the functionalist view can be regarded as incorrect. On the contrary, it holds that social origin has a strong direct effect on the social selection of the elites. Consequently, the social opening of the German educational system did not result into a social opening of the recruitment practices of the business elite. Rather, the opposite is the case: Social selection increased for the 1975 and 1985 cohorts.",Koln. Z. Soziol. Sozialpsych.

It is shown that hypotheses which assume the type of parenthood (natural or non-natural parenthood) as determining ones participation in familial labor cannot be confirmed.

Based on this definition we constructed a micro-model of corrupt actions in accordance with the rational-choice approach. We postulated that corrupt actions will be carried out in dependence on external situative stimuli or normative blockades. Administering 639 questionnaires to students of different subjects provided us with data on their behaviours in a fictitious situation of a manager deciding about the hiring of a trainee out of three applicants. The questionnaire systematically varied the role of the respondents (active, deciding vs. passive, assessing an already taken decision), the characteristics of the applicants and the structure of four situative expectations. The main result is: Particularistic stimuli promote, universalistic ones moderate proto-corruption. In a situation ambivalent in respect to both norms, the particularistic orientation will succeed. In an active situation (when the respondent must take a decision) the relation is weaker than in a passive (evaluative) situation, a result we explain by the higher complexity of the anticipated consequences of the decision. The results support demanding to focus research on the everyday preforms of corruption and to on the structural conditions of the transition from ''normal'' forms to those under the verdict of sanction.

Internalizing and externalizing problems at ages 6-8 significantly and strongly diminish the probability of receiving a high school degree. Among youth who receive a high school degree, externalizing problems also diminish the probability of subsequent college enrollment. In the case of high school degree receipt, the educatioral disadvantages associated with child emotional and behavioral problems result from the association of those problems with academic failures in middle and high school. In contrast, the association of childhood behavior problems with college enrollment appears to reflect the persisting effects of early behavioral and academic predispositions.

In both younger and older cohorts the transmission effect is confirmed. Surprisingly, however, there are huge sex differences in the impact of parents' divorces on their children. Sons of divorced parents have a much higher risk of divorce than girls. Explanations put forward to account for the transmission effect are critically examined. The inheritance of the risk of divorce cannot be explained by economic reasons alone or simply by a broken-family effect. For example, males from families dissolved by the death of a parent have a much lower risk of divorce than sons of divorced parents. Moreover, no difference in the risk of divorce could be detected, between males belonging to the post-war ''fatherless generation'' and males raised in two-parent families. Thus, the transmission effect cannot be explained by the decreased standard of living typically observed in all types of single-parent families. The data suggest, however, that differences in intervening variables may partially explain the transmission effect.",Z. Soziol.

This article aims to avoid both of these extreme positions by raising a question, instead, about one of Rational Choice's central propositions about religion. Tills proposition holds that levels of religious vitality vary positively with the degree to-which agencies of the state are prevented from regulating religious activity. The findings of recent research into prison chaplaincy in the UK and the USA will be used to test this claim. The main argument will be that the existence of an established church has facilitated a higher level of religious activity, especially for minority faiths, in prisons in England and Wales than is possible in American prisons. This difference in religious vitality is explained in terms of the Church of England's privileged position as a 'broker' between the state and minority faith communities. There is greater equality of opportunity for religious activity in American prisons, bur the level of die activity is necessarily lower. In neither country is there anp thing truly resembling a 'free' market for religion in prisons, but the established Church of England is able to use its quasi-monopoly powers to broker advantageous conditions for minority faith communities. This brokerage function may be advantageous to all religious organizations in the highly regulated 'economy' of prisons.",Br. J. Sociol.

This is the result of different institutional frameworks: Inclusion in employment depends to a considerable extent on national economic and institutional structures, for example, on the systems of industrial relationships, on social and taxation policies, on the patterns of private and family life, and on the educational system. The relative impact of these factors is verified on the basis of cross-national data for 19 OECD countries from the 1980 s and 1990 s. It can be shown that a dynamic educational policy, employment-centered taxation policies, an active family policy, and more flexible working-time arrangements can counteract the rather negative employment impact of strongly developed social Security systems and public services. The effects on the labor market participation of different age groups and sexes are very different: Above all, men profit from strong employment protection legislation and stronger wage differentiation while the labor market participation of women is facilitated by a better balance between work and family life, family services and cash benefits, and a higher education. Older employees profit front part-time work and stronger wage differentiation. While the Mediterranean and Continental European countries are shaped by industrial employment relationships, the labor market institutions of Scandinavian and Anglo-Saxon countries facilitate the expansion of personal and social services.",Z.

Large cohort size reduces the economic opportunities of its members and reduces income relative to smaller parental generations. Low relative economic status in turn leads to lower fertility, higher rates of female labor force participation, later marriage, higher divorce and illegitimacy, and increasing homicide, suicide, and alienation. Cycles in birth rates and cohort size suggest that the small baby bust cohorts entering adulthood in the 1990s will enjoy higher relative income, more traditional family structures, and lower levels of social disorganization. Of interest to economists and sociologists, the Easterlin effect has generated a large literature in the several decades since it was first proposed. Our review of the empirical studies notes the diversity of support across behaviors, time periods, and nations. Up to 1980, changes in wages, fertility, and social disorganization closely matched cohort size, but individual-level studies found little influence of relative income within cohorts. Further, the correspondence of the trends ends in the 1980s and appears in few countries other than the United States. Our review emphasizes both the contingent nature of the Easterlin effect and the way in which conditions have changed in recent decades to reduce the salience of cohort size for social and demographic behavior.",Annu.

The sociological ethics seminars provided unique opportunities for multi-disciplinary discussion of these inequalities and their impact on equitable intentions in health care.

His deep originality, of which he was fully aware, is to a large extent the consequence of his methodology.

It follows the objective of explaining social and political phenomena by procedures used by all sciences. 2) It gives central strategic value to comparative analysis. 3) It pays central attention to the discovery of conditional laws, i.e. ""if A, then B"", and interprets these laws as being driven by understandable motivations and reasons on the part of individual social actors. 4) It identifies typical social mechanisms and processes. 5) It defines implicitly the notion of ""good theory"" by the criteria accepted by modem epistemologists. The accuracy and validity of Tocqueville's methodology is responsible for the force of his analyses in the second volume of Democracy in America and in The Old Regime and the Revolution, the two works more particularly taken into consideration here.

Catastrophic events become the subject of symbolic, discursive conflicts. Two narratives compete for the legitimate interpretation of such disasters in modern public risk communication: the first one is a typical narrative of control, the second focuses on danger. The issue-attention structures and cycles of the mass media are in favour of dramatizing accounts. As the social experience of catastrophes is arranged by mass media, it is apparently this distant connection with disasters that constitutes temporary, rather fluid communities of danger. Within this process catastrophic events crystallize into social dramas, in which corresponding mass media shaped communities of experience negotiate their identity and basics of agency in space and time. Mass media coverage of catastrophic events oscillates between too much and too little attention; this is the origin of what could be called the paradox of risk society: On the one hand, the more frequent catastrophic events will occur, the less is their news value; they become normalized rather than scandalized. On the other hand, the less frequent they happen, the more intense their mass media coverage and the more likely are their public effects.",Berliner J. Soz.

These changes, however did not occur in all countries. We examine cohort variations in suicide rates in 14 modern, western societies using an extension of the age-period-cohort characteristic model that incorporates hierarchical linear modeling. Results support a general Durkheimian perspective. Birth cohorts experiencing relatively less social integration and regulation, as measured by higher rates of nonmarital births and larger relative cohort size, have higher suicide rates than other cohorts. Societies that provide alternative sources of social integration and regulation, as through collectivist institutions or through greater support for families and children, moderate this tendency. On the other hand, when societies experience rapid social change, the relationship between decreased social integration and regulation and increased suicide rates is stronger especially for males.

The aim of this contribution is to explain this extraordinary increase of saints and to analyze the function of canonizations and beatifications for the catholic church. Referring to Max Webers concept of charisma, it is shown that canonizations allow to extend the representation of the personal charisma in the church as an institution. In this way, the institutionalized charisma of office (Amtscharisma) that is always threatened by objectification and depersonalization can be connected with the personal charisma of the saints. Thus, canonization allows an additional legitimation of the institutionalized charisma by its repersonalization.

Although such acts of resistance may not cumulate to produce institutional change, they may nonetheless have consequences beyond the specific social transaction: the authors propose that a chief means for extending the social consequences of resistance is to transform an act of resistance into a story about resistance. Based upon an appreciation of the structural conditions of power and authority, stories of resistance can become instructions about both the sources and the limitations of power.

The main objective of these developments is the social exclusion of undesirable persons and social groups in order to guarantee the personal and cultural integrity of the inhabitants. Meanwhile, more than 20,000 gated communities are spread all over the urban regions in the United States of America and more than eight million citizens have decided to live behind their walls. However, the radical spatial cut off has severe social, cultural, political ans psychological consequences. This essay discusses the causes, types and forms of these ""citadels of security"" as well as the consequences of their proliferation.",Berliner J. Soz.

In-depth ethnographic evidence challenges the predominant juxtaposition of Islam against the secular state. Following micro-sites of interaction between the Gulen movement and the state from Turkey to Kazakhstan, my fieldwork revealed a continuum of engagements between them. The paper analyses the engagements ranging from contestation and negotiation to co-operation. The case illustrates the extent to which scholarly interest in opposition and clash has left a wide-ranging variety of state-Islam interaction understudied with regard to civil society. It also reveals the conditions under which effective Islamic horizontal organizations have provided the platforms of vertical engagements with the secular states. The major argument of the paper is that both civil and uncivil outcomes in the Muslim world are primarily shaped by the nature of state-Islam interaction. The evidence suggests that the key to understanding the relationship between Islam and civil society is the state.",Br. J. Sociol.

These effects are strongest in the early phase of the Bill of Rights campaign, a period for which there is also robust evidence of contagious influence among nearby cities. The authors argue that the campaign's success lies in the miscibility of multiple movements-the ability of groups with different beliefs, agendas, and traditions to combine around a common goal. The case is used to distinguish between strong and weak forms of miscibility and to develop insight into strategic, organizational, and political conditions that promote the construction of movement-spanning coalitions.",Am.

The network society is the social structure characteristic of the Information Age, as tentatively identified by empirical, cross-cultural investigation. It permeates most societies in the world, in various cultural and institutional manifestations, as the industrial society characterized the social structure of both capitalism and statism for most of the twentieth century. Social structures are organized around relationships of production, consumption, power, and experience, Whose spatial-temporal configurations constitute cultures. They are enacted, reproduced, and ultimately transformed by social actors, rooted in the social structure, yet freely engaging in conflictive social practices, With Unpredictable outcomes. A fundamental feature of social structure in the Information Age is its reliance on networks as the key feature of social morphology. While networks are old forms of social organization, they are no v empowered by new information/communication technologies, so that they become able to cope at the same time with flexible decentralization, and with focused decision-making. The article examines the specific interaction between network morphology and relationships of production/consumption, power, experience, and culture, in the historical making of the emerging social structure at the turn of the millenium.",Berliner J.

The vocation of bank clerk has traditionally been identified with high social recognition and broad skills and has been regarded as a good starting point for a career. However, for some years the perspectives of the Occupation have been deteriorating. In contrast to the arguments ill some contributions to the discussion in the social sciences, this development is not rooted in general problems of the adaptability of this occupation to innovative and knowledge-based forms of work organization. On the contrary, the process of reorganization in the banking sector has led to a reduced demand for skills in the central employment area of bank clerks, the retail units. In the course of financialization, divisionalization, and segmentation, which are the core elements of reorganization, the dual apprenticeship system is indreasingly subject to high cost pressures. Moreover, a gap is arising between the demand for skills, the Occupational profile, and the training practices in the banks. While the large private banks are adapting their training practices to the new demands at the expense of the occupational profile, other banking groups are producing a Surplus of skills with problematic consequences for personnel policy.",Z.

Major record companies employ an open system of development and production that incorporates innovation and diversity as an effective strategy in maintaining the viability and control of the market.  As examples, I discuss new styles of music appearing in the 1980s, radio and music video exposure, and distribution and retailing.

Second, we consider the work of behavioral genetics and the assertion of the relevance of genetic differences between persons for understanding differences in behaviors and outcomes. Third, we consider assertions of the relevance of particular proximate bioindicators for understanding how the biological and social interact, focusing particularly on studies of testosterone and the prospects of developments in neuroscientific measurement. We do not believe that developments in these fields will force sociologists to acquire considerable biological expertise to pursue questions central to the discipline, but we do advocate further efforts from biologically minded sociologists to articulate understandings of the relationship between sociology and biology that will continue to push us past the commonplace view that biological and sociological explanations are inevitably opposed.",Annu.

The analysis shows that ability is an important factor influencing social mobility chances, and through a series of logistic regression and multiple regression models, it demonstrates that meritocratic factors (individual effort and ability) outweigh social advantage/disadvantage factors in predicting the occupational class achieved by over 6,000 men and women by age 33.

In considering this question the article mainly focuses on the conceptions of Jurgen Habermas and Donald Davidson. In spite of some fundamental similarities between the outlooks of both thinkers, there is a contrast in regard to their interpretation of the relationship between meaning and action. According to Habermas, communicative action is semantically self-identifying, i.e. in the case of communicative action the meaning of the sentence uttered determines the speaker's intention and what type of action is performed. This conception dates back to Searle's idea that meaning and action are related by constitutive rules. In the article I question the validity of Habermas's and Searle's analysis. Some objections to this analysis can be derived from Davidson's criticism of convention-based theories of communication. Subsequently, Davidson's model of communication and the role of intentions of speakers and interpreters within this model are examined. According to Davidson, no necessary relation exist between sentence-meaning, the act performed, and the speaker's intentions. Nevertheless, interpretation rests on the hearer's conjectures with regard to these elements. The Davidsonian approach to communication contradicts not only rule-governed approaches but also post-structuralist approaches and Luhmann's view of communication because, according to Davidson's model, sentences and actions can only be understood on the basis of the speaker's intentions and the interpreter's ability to infer these intentions.",Z.

The article considers whether gender-neutral discourses of flexible working succeed in encouraging more men and non-parents to use flexible working arrangements, thereby potentially reducing the gender pay gap. The study highlighted gendered patterns of take-up of flexible working. Women who worked flexibly or part time typically did so to combine working with caring commitments, in ways that damaged their career prospects. In contrast, men typically deferred working flexibly to a later stage when their career had progressed further. There was therefore a clear impact on current and future salary for women taking up flexible working arrangements, which was not equivalent for the men who did so.

These pressures are producing convergence in the objectives and activities of these systems in several key areas, including cost-containment, health promotion, expansion of access, primary health care, patient choice, and the linkage between health and social services. At the same time, it is also necessary to recognize the role of political and governmental processes, as well as clinical and professional variables, in shaping different societal responses to health care challenges.",Annu.

92,2175,"HUBNER, P; GEHRMANN, A",1997,Teachers and social change. Selected findings from a 1996 survey of teachers in Berlin,,,"In this contribution, the authors reconstruct the public image of the teacher in Germany over the years and hold it up to the mirror of their 1996 survey on ''Experiences and Occupational Self-Concept of Teachers in Berlin'', which was carried out in the framework of the DFG Research Group on ''Schools and Education During the Transformation from Soviet Occupation Zone to German Democratic Republic to New Federal States''. In comparing teachers from eastern and western Berlin, the authors pursued hypotheses of both convergence and divergence. The value orientation found among teachers in east and west is in many cases similar but often quite different. Factor and cluster analyses show these groups to be particularly divided in their attitudes toward integrative and selective school models. In the western part of Berlin, it appears impossible to reconcile the concepts of integration and selectivity, while in the east they have combined to become part of the standard programme. For the authors, this split reveals a divergence deserving of further study, for it may be a marker to the next stage of research in this area. Finally it is asked whether the implications of the East-West divide can be overcome through research so that we can move on to the question: How and under what circumstances can the experience gained in the new federal states following unification be transferred to the states of former West Germany?",Berliner J.

93,2105,"GALL, G",1997,Developments in trade unionism in the financial sector in Britain,,,"This article puts forward evidence to argue that finance workers, especially bank workers, in Britain are becoming more 'unionate'. This is not to argue that these workers are becoming 'militant' for while the developments are significant they remain cautious and uneven. An examination is made of why these developments have occurred and how they relate to the employers' human resource policies, why the growth in trade unionism in the financial sector runs counter to a trend of decline elsewhere and why significant differences in trade unionism exist within the different components in the financial sector.",Work Employ.

94,759,"BEETZ, M",2010,The Disagreeable System. Herbert Spencer's Work as a Prototype of Universal Theory,,,"Unlike Marx, Durkheim, or Weber, sociology's collective memory does not hold Spencer in high esteem. His theory is presumed to propagate social Darwinism; and it seems to presuppose a teleological idea of progress and the acceptance of biological analogies. Less attention is paid to his historical role, his writings, and the cosmological character of his entire work. However, Spencer's philosophical system can be understood as an analytical ontology providing a catalogue of scientific topics. Contrary to monothetic diagnoses and methodological theories, it typifies an altogether different kind of universal theory, of which Luhmann's system theory would later be another instance. Since the work of Spencer marks the most universal and radical version of this theoretical type, to engage with Spencer means to address the issue of the possibility of universal theory and its functional equivalents. Such an engagement may help to make current debates over social theory more precise.",Z. Soziol.

Risk of harm to children and the organized intervention into the private sphere,Social intervention; Risk of harm to children; Organizational fields; Regulation; Private sphere; Contingency,,"Welfare state moderated social interventions into private life are faced with high expectations, which are often unrealistic, as this article shows for the case of child endangerment. A multidimensional analysis of this field, in which the diagnosis of institutional malfunction was put forward recently, shows considerable problems of contingency for such interventions. This results from field specific institutional regulations and organizational arrangements as well as peculiarities of the private sphere, at which the interventions are aiming. Due to those problems of contingency, optimal intervention trajectories cannot be taken for granted. The article develops this hypothesis on the basis of a scattered (and only marginally sociologically reasoned) technical literature and preliminary findings of an empirical field research currently undertaken. It highlights the restrictions, tensions and contradictions which render the interventional dynamic as a process remarkably governed by chance.",Berliner J. Soz.

This paper summarises three versions of the sociology of psychiatry (social causationism, interpretive micro-sociology and structuralism). These are then contrasted with the more recent post-structuralist emphasis on deconstruction. The latter has emphasised a discursive shift in psychiatry since Victorian times, from brain to mind, from coercion to voluntarism, and from hospital to community. The advantages and disadvantages of such an analysis are examined. It is concluded that this analysis has been illuminating but that the older approaches it challenges still have merits. The implications of attempting to reconcile these approaches to the analysis of contemporary psychiatry are discussed.",Sociol.-J. Brit. Sociol. Assoc.
97,126,"LUTZ, S; EBERLE, D",2008,Mechanisms of Institutional Change in German Capitalism. The Transformation of Corporate Governance Regulation,Institutional change; Varieties of capitalism; Regulation; Corporate governance; Accounting,1990S,"In the debate on the convergence of Rhenish capitalism towards the Anglo-Saxon model there is a growing consensus on the emergence of hybrid institutional configurations which combine elements of both systems. Our paper traces the mechanisms and driving forces leading to varying degrees of convergence with Anglo-Saxon standards and institutions by comparing the changes in two areas of German corporate governance regulation, namely internal corporate governance and accounting. Whereas existing institutions were coupled with Anglo-Saxon elements in the case of internal corporate governance (""layering""), traditional standards and institutions were substituted for new ones in the case of accounting (""displacement""). We argue that the varying degree of convergence can be explained by the different preferences of key national actors, such as companies and trade unions, in the two cases and the varying exogenous pressures for reforms. Our study highlights the importance of a meso-level analysis of causal mechanisms for the explanation of institutional change in modem capitalism.",Berliner J. Soz.

These estimates encompass whites and blacks of the baby boom generation and the two preceding generations. The white-black gap in lifetime inheritances is found to increase both absolute and relative racial wealth inequality. The gap is estimated to be much larger for the baby boom generation than for previous generations. Combined with the stalling of blacks' progress in earnings relative to whites' since the 1980s, the baby boom generation may thus have begun a reversal of progress toward racial economic equality, with inheritances playing a key role in this reversal.",Am.

99,1687,"MERKEL, W",2000,The third ways of social democracy into the 21st century,,,"At the end of the twentieth century the politics and policies of New Labour under Tony Blair and Anthony Giddens's ""Third way"" have triggered a new ""revisionist"" debate within European social democracy. However, if one looks closer to the actual policies of the various social democratic led governments (Great Britan, Netherlands, Sweden, France) one has to distinguish between different Third ways. The experience of all social democratic governments shows - albeit to a different degree - a lack of programmatic ideas and actual political commitment to use the European Union as the new strategic space for their policies. However, the EU has to be discovered by social democracy in order to compensate for the loss of national sovereignty in policy making in times of globalization. The Third ways of social democracy into the 21st century lead through ""Europe"".",Berliner J. Soz.
