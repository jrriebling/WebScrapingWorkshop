(BEGIN VIDEO CLIPS)
CHRIS MATTHEWS, MSNBC HOST: Trump also continues to bash the media of course, even quoted the hacker Julian Assange calling American media coverage ""very dishonest."" Trump added to that, more dishonest than anyone knows. Trump is engaged in an un-president (ph) effort by an American president to undermine the trust (ph).
CHARLIE SYKES, EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, RIGHT WISCONSIN: You see, Donald Trump taking Julian Assange at his word and mocking American intelligence agencies. Look, if this was a monologue from Rush Limbaugh it would be bizarre but coming from the incoming president of the United States is generally alarming. 
DANA PERINO, FOX NEWS HOST: Democrats are trying to soothe themselves with the notion that Russia interfered in the election, trying to delegitimize the Trump presidency and I think he's right to push back on that.
(END VIDEO CLIPS)
KURTZ: Sean Spicer, the new White House press secretary and whether he agrees that journalists are dishonest in his first ""Media Buzz"" appearance.
House Republicans do a 180 on gunning the Congressional Ethics Office. Did the media outcry forced this embarrassing reversal?
Megyn Kelly stuns the television world by deciding to leave Fox for NBC.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
MEGYN KELLY, FOX NEWS HOST: This is a tough decision for me because I love this show, our staff, my crew, my colleagues here at Fox, and you, all of you.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
KURTZ: We'll look at the impact on both networks and talk to her prime time replacement, Tucker Carlson.
Plus, ""Wall Street Journal"" editor Gerry Baker says he' be careful about calling Trump or any politician a liar and gets a ton of media abuse.
I'm Howard Kurtz and this is MEDIA BUZZ.
With the president-elect at the center of a growing storm over Russian hackers and CIA investigations and Julian Assange and of course the media and punching back on twitter, let's get right to my interview with Sean Spicer, the incoming White House press secretary. I spoke to him from Trump Tower.
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
KURTZ: Sean Spicer, welcome.
SEAN SPICER, INCOMING WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: Thanks Howie.
KURTZ: Donald Trump tweeted on Friday about the leaking of the administration's report on Russian hacking, I'm asking the chairs of the House and Senate committees to investigate top secret intelligence shared with NBC prior to me seeing it. I can understand his concern, but does that signal as president he will be ordering leak investigations to find out reporter sources?
SPICER: Well, it's not the reporter sources. It's trying to figure out where it came from. I mean, there's a big difference between reporters doing their job and sourcing things and people in the government improperly giving classified information to people or potentially doing that. And I think there's a big difference whether you're targeting the source or the recipient.
KURTZ: Right. Now, ""Politico"" has a big headline, ""Trump's Twitter Feed Paralyzes Washington,"" because apparently it upsets beltway power brokers and you know, some girls (ph) seem say, hey, we shouldn't even cover his tweets which is ridiculous. Why do you think these short messages are unnerving to the establishment?
SPICER: Well it's not just to have the length of them, it's the movement that's behind them. That's the important part. He's closing in on 19 million people that follow him on Twitter alone. He's got close to 50 million across three different platforms, and I think what people have realized in Washington and elsewhere is that when he tweets, he has a movement that's behind him.
His speaks truth to power, he understands the frustration and concerns of the American people like nobody else and he can speak directly to them, and the thing about Twitter that's unique is that you see the number of re- tweets and the actions that are taken and the coverage it gets. And people understand that, you know, mountains get moved when he tweets, businesses react, governments act, he gets things done, he is successful because of the message that he has and the movement that he commands.
KURTZ: And you're not getting the memo in advance so then you have to respond to questions about this, do you think that will change a bit after January 20th?
SPICER: Nope, not at all. I think he's going to continue to do -- look, the thing that I find interesting about the question, and I know you're asking it, but from a lot of the mainstream media they ask a question as if there's something wrong. I think it's been phenomenally successful. And I think that to some degree, you know, the headline that you just read is right.
People realize that when he speaks, whether it's by Twitter or otherwise, he actually has a tremendous amount of sway and influence on other politicians, on companies, on executives, on foreign leaders because they understand that he has tapped into where the country is and where the support is well, for key positions in policies.
KURTZ: No, what I say is get used to it. This is the way he communicates and is part of the reason he won the election. But let's quote a tweet involving WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, Trump quoted him as talking about dishonest media coverage.
He added, ""more dishonest than anyone knows."" Is it unfair, Sean, for the media to point out that it's rather unusual for an incoming president to side with a guy who's a fugitive from justice in expressing skepticism for the findings of U.S. intelligence agencies?
SPICER: You know, that's not what he did. He stated a fact whereas Julian Assange went on your network and said when asked by Sean Hannity whether or not he did this, and he was behind you, he said no. And I think part of what is missing a lot of times in the mainstream media's dialogue of this particular instance is the context in all of it, which is that Julian Assange while factually stated that he or -- excuse me -- he stated that he wasn't behind it and I think that the president-elect was simply stating a fact that he stated in an interview with Sean Hannity.
KURTZ: Right. Now, Trump also accused -- this is another tweet -- accused the media of peddling lies in painting him, he says, as being against the intelligence community. My question for you is, you've dealt with reporters for years. You're a veteran spokesman. You're very good at this. Do you think the media lie and are intentionally dishonest?
SPICER: I think some reporters clearly have a bias and choose to only look at only part of the story so there's no question about it. As you said, I've been doing this a long time. Thank you for the complement, but I also believe that some reporters have chosen to look at the click bait model of reporting which is ignore some facts because more will be sensational and will generate more, you know, re-tweets or clicks, and I think that is dishonest. A job of a good reporter should make sure that you put all of the facts out there, report the entire story in context and I think for some reporters, they would rather overlook certain facts because the story wouldn't be as glamorous and sensational.
KURTZ: But does it make it harder for you to do your job when your boss uses words like lying and dishonest, you know, part of your job is to maintain cordial relationship with the press corp.
SPICER: And I have, and I think we'll continue to do that and reporters will do their job fairly and responsibly. We'll continue to treat with the level of respect that you should with any human being. But I think that some of these folks when they bend dishonest, when they fail to overlook the facts so frankly, you look to get the whole story and get it right, they should be called out.
I don't think there's anything wrong. Reporters have a first amendment right to write whatever they want, frankly. But I think that individuals, including the president-elect have a right to correct the record and then make sure that factual inaccuracies or the failure to report the entire story is equally called out.
KURTZ: They and you absolutely have that right. On the question of White House briefings, you've now said that there will be something every day, may not be televised, maybe some kind of off camera gaggle or meeting, but what's the argument against televising every White House press briefing that is too much posturing for the cameras?
SPICER: Yes, and again, I just wanted to 100 percent crystal clear, what I'm doing is the same thing that the president-elect has challenged everyone that he's asked to serve at his administration, whether at the staff level or at the cabinet level.
Which is to go in, look at how we can do things better in building a better product to the American people, whether it's a press briefing or getting information out or whether it's reforming the V.A. He's challenged everybody that is going to serve in this administration to see if we can do things better, more effectively, more efficiently. And I'm doing what he's asked me to do, which is to study all these things and work --
KURTZ: Right. On this question of the cameras -- on this question of the cameras --
SPICER: Right.
KURTZ: Potentially, what's the effect?
SPICER: Right, and I think of the things -- right, and one of the things that reporters and others have pointed out equally is that sometimes once the cameras go on, then it becomes more of a show than an informational session where news is discussed and a back and forth ensues with the press corps. So, several folks in the press corps and frankly past press secretaries have suggested that that be looked at.
It wasn't until, you know, it hasn't been that long since that's been the case and I think there are other institutions that have done that. And again, maybe we don't change anything, maybe we add a gaggle to the daily press conference, maybe we just invite more of the American people into this conversation, which I think the president-elect is very keen on because this is a conversation that shouldn't be limited to just the big media, if you will.
There's a lot of proliferation especially on the conservative media side. People have done a really good job and are committed to making sure they get the story straight. They should have equal access and have an opportunity to have their questions asked and answered to get that perspective out to key constituencies.
KURTZ: Sean Spicer, thanks for coming in front of our cameras. Hope you'll come back.
SPICER: Of course. Thanks Howie. Have a great weekend.
(END VIDEOTAPE)
KURTZ: And joining us now with analysis, Erin McPike, political commentator and a former reporter for RealClealPolitics, Amy Holmes, political analyst with Rasmussen Reports and Charles Lane, ""Washington Post"" columnist and editorial writer and a Fox News contributor.
Erin, Donald Trump is now accusing the media of outright lying of (INAUDIBLE), of the intelligence agencies, his skepticism about U.S. intel though he's now essentially accepted the findings of this report. Is he going too far of that charge of lying?
ERIN MCPIKE, POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: I think he is because I don't think, and I know this will be unpopular for some of the viewers (INAUDIBLE) but the media doesn't knowingly lie. You know, what Sean Spicer said in that interview was that the media would include some facts and not others. Some details versus others, that's editorial judgment. You can put in to your story what you want and make a decision about what you don't put in.
KURTZ: You're saying there is bias, there is tilting --
MCPIKE: There is a bias, sure, absolutely.
KURTZ: -- there is out of context but you don't think it's intentionally lying?
MCPIKE: No.
KURTZ: Trump told the ""New York Times"" the other day that all this amounts to a political witch hunt. What the press sees as this unusual spectacle I mentioned to Spicer, incoming president at odds with the U.S. intel agencies over Russia. He sees, I believe that it's his detractors using the hacking issue to undermine the legitimacy of his victory with --
AMY HOLMES, RASMUSSEN REPORTS: And I think that he would be right -- also, excellent interview with Mr. Spicer, Mr. Kurtz.
KURTZ: Thank you.
HOLMES: You look at a ""New York Times"" headlines for example that said, ""Putin Ordered Influence Campaign Aimed at U.S. Election Report Says."" Well, the government report said that but a lot of conservative and also technical experts have said that the report doesn't prove that.
And if you could prove that Putin was influencing this election, then you have a spy who is more brave and gets more information than James Bond as far as the CIA. And Maureen Dowd also in her column is saying, you know, the world is upside down. We now have the ""New York Times"" at the Cold War years believing he CIA and conservatives being skeptical.
KURTZ: Chuck Lane, Trump as I mentioned to Sean Spicer, urging the Hill committees to investigate the leak of the intelligence (INAUDIBLE) to NBC - - actually it's the ""Washington Post"" first reported on this then nonpublic report, and you heard Spicer say that president Trump would pursue investigations to find the government officials who were leaking, he says not reporter sources but can you disentangle the two?
CHARLES LANE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Of course not. I didn't understand what this distinction was that Sean was trying to draw. I think under the current president, if I'm not mistaken, James Rosen of this network got named as an undivided co-conspirator in a course of a leak investigation, which was ostensibly aimed at the State Department official who was thought to be the ultimate source of the information.
KURTZ: Right. And those phone records and other private material were without his knowledge or anyone at Fox were subpoenaed and obtained.
LANE: Yes. So, leak information inevitably is going to lead somehow to reporters. So I think Sean owes us a little bit better explanation.
HOLMES: I disagree with that. I think there were actually points up the distinction that Mr. Spicer was making., which is the government investigating illegal leaks from the government to the press versus putting the attack dogs on members of the press.
MCPIKE: This is what Nixon did. I mean, you know, like this is -- to me, these two tweets, and there is another one he said, ""a couple of days earlier, how did NBC get an exclusive look into the top secret report Obama was presented? Who gave him this report and why? Politics. This is a --
KURTZ: That's a fair question.
MCPIKE: That's a fair analysis.
KURTZ: Somebody leaked this.
MCPIKE: What I'm saying is he said that one day and then a couple of days later he said he we wanted to direct Senate and House committees to investigate. Going after the source of a leak is a problem. I mean it's a warning shot to the intelligence community. We all know that he's rumbling with the intelligence community and once he becomes president he doesn't want the intelligence community continue leaking to the press.
HOLMES: Exposing national security information to the public is not legal and government authorities do have the right to go after that, but there is the distinction that reporting on it is and the Supreme Court has protected that right.
KURTZ: And there has been a great up surge in these leak investigations that journalists under the Obama administration has a lot of people now freaking out about president-elect Trump.
All right, ahead, Tucker Carlson on covering Donald Trump now that he's succeeding Megyn Kelly in primetime. But when we come back, conservative pundits and politicians who couldn't sand Julian Assange, now singing his praises.
KURTZ: Some conservative commentators now taking a very different view of Julian Assange. Here's what Sean Hannity told the WikiLeaks founder during their interview in London.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
SEAN HANNITY, FOX NEWS HOST: I -- and I've told you this before when you first came on the scene in 2010, I was concerned you were waging war against the U.S. I can't believe that you've done two things that have been extraordinarily helpful to the United States and then I think journalism in a way.
One is you showed us that we do not have cyber security, you acknowledge that. And two, I think in this election in particular you exposed a level of corruption that I for 30 years on the radio as a conservative knew existed.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
KURTZ: Amy Holmes, it looks like some conservative commentators who despise Julian Assange as a left winger, who was endangering U.S. national security and secrets, are now making him to a bit of an icon, not just talking about I'm here, because he damaged the Democrats during the election.
HOLMES: Well, I think actually that among conservatives, that there are a lot of mixed views about Julian Assange particularly when it came to Bradley Manning and Edward Snowden because national security issues were at stake. And now there is still mixed views of Julian Assange if you read hotair.com or (INAUDIBLE), they take what Julian Assange has to say with a lot of salt. There's a lot of holding the nose at the source of this but looking at exactly what he did expose and whether or not that was helpful to Republicans in the election.
KURTZ: Chuck, six years ago Sarah Palin likened Julian Assange to a terrorist when WikiLeaks published her personal e-mails which she says were boring. She just apologized to him on her Facebook page so, what's going on here?
LANE: What's going on here is that people don't have principles, that this is a cancer of American politics, which is that people will believe or say what suits their partisan interest in the short-term.
KURTZ: And both parties do this.
LANE: Well, it's an across the board phenomenon and of course, you know, now we have a lot of people who used to (INAUDIBLE) Julian Assange talking about what a menace he is and that's going on as well. No, this is the fundamental problem with American politics across the board, is that people no longer make principled arguments, they make opportunistic arguments and this is simply just a particularly galling and extreme case of it.
KURTZ: Erin McPike, here is what Donald Trump tweeted, ""The dishonest media, he says, like saying that I am in agreement with Julian Assange, wrong. I simply state what he states. It is for the people."" Here's a very good exchange, you might have seen this clip this week of Donald Trump, then businessman billionaire talking to Brian Kilmeade about WikiLeaks.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
BRIAN KILMEADE, FOX NEWS HOST: You had nothing to d with the leaking of those --
DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT-ELECT: No, but I think it's disgraceful.
KILMEADE: You do think it's disgraceful.
TRUMOP: -- it should be like death penalty or something.
(END OF VIDEO CLIP)
KURTZ: So evolution of views about Assange?
MCPIKE: Maybe so. That's the principle that we like to call in media saving the tape. So, we might see the rest of the conservative elites who are now, you know, siding with Assange. Flipping back is at some point WikiLeaks put out more about what's going on in the government in the next couple of years in Trump's administration because inevitably things will go wrong.
KURTZ: (INAUDIBLE) I want to get more thing, MSNBC Joe Scarborough accused Republicans of hypocrisy and said Sean Hannity was having a bromance with Assange. Well, Hannity tweeted back that ""Morning Joe"" had used part of the interview and ""Joe, what's really repulsive says, Hannity, is the pathetically low ratings you have on the network that colluded with Hillary Clinton."" It's getting heated there.
HOLMES: I will let them have their food fight and watch. But you know, conservatives have always had a very conflicted attitude toward Julian Assange. I remember when I worked at TheBlze, there was this feeling of hate -- love the sin, hate the sinner. The information is important, how we are getting it, that's something we need to look more closely on.
KURTZ: Let me get another break. You can e-mail us on mediabuzz@Foxnews.com, weigh in on the media. Ahead on this program, the editor of the ""Wall Street Journal"" on being attacked for saying he's careful, careful about accusing Trump or any politician of lying. But first, did the press force House Republicans to cave on gutting an ethics office.
KURTZ: House Republicans generated a wave of negative headlines by secretly voting to gut the Congressional Ethics office followed by a scalding tweet from Donald Trump and spanking by the pundits on the right as well as the left.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
JOE SCARBOROUGH, MSNBC HOST: This is ridiculous. It's the last thing -- this is what happens. I mean, time and time again a party takes control of power and here Republicans have complete power and their first act out of the gate is just complete arrogance, it's a horrific misstep.
LAURA INGRAHAM, RADIO SHOW HOST: It was disastrous timing and messaging. For the first moment out the gate they had the story out there. When I woke up when I saw this this morning, I thought to myself, you've got to be kidding me.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
KURTZ: Within hours, the GOP caucus caved and reversed the vote on the independent ethics office. Chuck Lane, a lot of people credited this Republican caving to Trump tweeting that this shouldn't be a priority with a country facing so many problems, but wasn't he in part reacting to all the negative headlines and punditry about this (INAUDIBLE)?
LANE: In the sense that I'm sure he didn't know it was going to happen in advance, he probably just read about it in the papers and I guess it's a tribute to Donald Trump's common sense if he was able to see that what everybody else saw, which was this is a bone-head move and terrible --
KURTZ: He could have said nothing.
LANE: He could have said nothing which leads me to my next point, which is think that in the whole matrix of factors that cause the GOP representatives in the house to back down on this, the Trump tweet was the most important and showed that he was willing to go up against them and sort of bring them into line. And, you know, the question is like how many more times is that going to happen over the next four years. It was sort of a little opening inning kind of power struggle between him and --
KURTZ: -- with the baseball. Now, the House also was flooded with angry calls from constituents and that always gets the attention of the members of Congress. But, you also have to say that this happened on the morning where the big front page stories and the ""New York Times"" and ""Washington Post"" have basically said, ""This is the first thing you guys are going to do in the Trump era?""
MCPIKE: OK, there are negative headlines about House Republicans all the time. Why does anybody think that this time negative headlines forced the Republicans to reverse course? I do think and I know a lot of comments is saying not --
KURTZ: Are you thinking it got very little effect?
MCPIKE: I think it's more the calls in Trump's tweets. Of course, when Donald Trump has the ability to separate himself from House Republicans who are not popular, still, he's going to do it. He is going to show independents.
KURTZ: There maybe arguments about how the ethics office operates. Both Democrats and Republicans hate this independent office, but one hot button for the press, Amy, is that this was done behind closed doors on a federal holiday?
HOLMES: Certainly it seems very sneaky, but you know, I want to leave it at Chuck saying that this is a tribute to Donald Trump's common sense. I think that is the--
KURTZ: We'll write that down.
HOLMES: Yes. Absolutely.
KURTZ: Do you think that's his --
(CROSSTALK)
HOLMES: I do.
LANE: But what little he has. But I do think that the Trump role is what's decisive because it is true that the Republicans get bashed in ""Washington Post"" headlines every day.
HOLMES: Could I add, I think it also that they're getting criticism across the board including from conservatives -- including from conservatives on this network.
KURTZ: Yes, very basically, the media may have more occasion to write about Donald Trump versus House Republicans and Senate Republicans because he ran against the GOP establishment.
MCPIKE: And think about it, a lot of voters in the Rust Belt might have voted for Obama in 2008 and 2012 and they are probably the ones who put Donald Trump over the edge. He knows that. So when he has the opportunity to bash Republicans, he's going to do it.
KURTZ: By the way, we're talking about Julian Assange and shifting views of the WikiLeaks (INAUDIBLE) segment. He's a fugitive from justice, I just want to underscore that, and hold up in the Ecuadorian embassy rather than face sexual assault allegations. All right, that's a wrap. Erin McPike, Amy Holmes, Chuck Lane, great to see you this Sunday.
Up next, Tucker Carlson on this challenge of succeeding Megyn Kelly and responding to his critics, and later, can Megyn succeed in daytime when she moves to NBC.
KURTZ: Well, it didn't take look for Fox News to announce a new 9:00 p.m. show after Megyn Kelly's decision to leave for NBC. Tucker Carlson, whose program at 7:00 eastern launched only a few weeks ago moves into the coveted primetime slot tomorrow. I sat down with him here in studio one.
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
KURTZ: Tucker Carlson.
TUCKER CARLSON, FOX NEWS HOST: Howard Kurtz, ladies and gentlemen.
KURTZ: So now you're officially a big primetime star. Your huge anchor ego is soaring out of control?
CARLSON: It's out of control. Is it out of control? No. Except a lot of e- mail -- I have more e-mail that I used to have. No, I mean it's --
KURTZ: -- confrontational question.
CARLSON: It's a little intimidating. But, you know, the beauty of working at Fox is Fox has a big audience and one that I'm not going to convince myself that it's about me. I've worked with a lot of different networks and where you works makes all the difference basically.
KURTZ: Well, you do things a little bit differently at 9:00 o'clock because though Fox, that's been more of as much as a new show, it's an opinion show because it's consistently live hour in primetime. Are you going to make some tweaks and adjustments here?
CARLSON: Of course. I mean look, you got to have -- 9:00 is an hour for, among other things, newsmakers and -- I mean my view is that, you know, you can have a newsy interview that cuts through a lot of the cant and (INAUDIBLE) gets to the core point, doesn't need to be confrontational or half so or anything. But it does need to be direct and I think viewers want that.
KURTZ: You're an unabashed conservative founder of ""The Daily Caller."" Some media critics react to this by saying, well, you're sympathetic to Donald Trump and now Fox (INAUDIBLE) Trump skeptic in primetime, fair on unfair?
CARLSON: Well, I'm a skeptic of everything, of everyone. And I think if there's one lesson of this election is that voters want deep skepticism trained on Washington especially, but on all concentrations of power.
KURTZ: And you think there's not enough of that in the media?
CARLSON: There is not enough for that at all -- at all. It's very much our team and their team. It's very partisan. But I think there's a lot of sucking up to power here. A lot of Trump sniffing going on in D.C. now more than ever.
KURTZ: Well, you've said Trump wasn't your first choice for president and you (INAUDIBLE) weren't even sure if he really wanted the job and he has got it now. And you also said in your tweet (ph) to other day that when you launch the show you want to hold people accountable, let people in power tend to lie, that they can be pompous so, does that apply to the new president and the new administration?
CARLSON: Of course it does. It will always apply to anybody who is taking my money and wielding power over me, of course. What I thought about Trump to the very beginning is what I think about now, which is despite his flaws as a man, he was saying things that no one else dared to say that were not only true but resonant for a lot of people.
I mean he forced the Republicans Party to rethink its economic views. I'm not even sure we thought them but he has forced them to reckon with a whole different way of looking at economics, and in my view that's why he won. I saw that (INAUDIBLE) and I said wow, you know, people don't buy the Republican economic program actually.
KURTZ: You've told the story about 15 years ago, you're on CNN, you said something nasty about Trump's hair, you got a voicemail from him. Funny, too vulgar to repeat on the air, what did you take from episode?
CARLSON: That Trump -- I mean I took a bunch of (INAUDIBLE). That Trump is brazenly direct, that he's vulgar, and the life of the newsroom so that's obviously not a departure from me -- that he's hilarious, that he can be thin-skinned and that he's interesting. And I think all of it seems now.
KURTZ: Everybody will be asking you off the air, what he say -- what he say. All right, now you have gotten attention with this new show as an aggressive interviewer. Some critics thought you were too aggressive for example with a young woman named Lauren Duca from ""Teen Vougue."" You took her on over her criticism of Donald and Ivanka Trump and she didn't like it and she called you a bully and there's a whole lot (INAUDIBLE). So is there a line about between being aggressive and being too rough with the guest?
CARLSON: Well, it depends on who the guest is. I mean I would never be aggressive, I mean I'd probably be pretty timid with a lot of guests who weren't there to push their political views on other people but the second you're out there espousing your views and demanding other people conform to those views, I think, you know, I have the right to press you and ask you to explain your views.
And that's all I was doing with her. I was treating her like an adult. I don't think she's used to that and she didn't care for it and started yelling at me but I didn't treat her any differently than I treat anybody else who wrote what she wrote. And by the way, its total legitimate to dislike Trump, of course it is. Well, a lot of people I know dislike Trump and even more legitimate to disagree with Trump, which I do myself sometimes. But I just didn't think she was explaining herself.
KURTZ: You paid a lot of dues. You worked for CNN -- you had a show. You had a show in MSNBC where in matter of fact you famously were on ""Crossfire"" when you got into it with John Stewart.
CARLSON: Yes.
KURTZ: Did you think after those two stints that maybe you were a good (INAUDIBLE) when it came to being a host?
CARLSON: I don't know, I mean, I think maybe my one advantage is I have failed in the past and I would recommend failure to anyone. It's painful.
KURTZ: How so?
CARLSON: Because you learn a lot about -- you know, winning doesn't teach you anything. It gratifies all your instincts. It tells you whatever you are doing worked, keep doing it.
KURTZ: You thought you're a hot stuff and you --
CARLSON: Exactly. Failure forces you to assess yourself in a way that nothing else does and real failure, like your neighbors abort their gaze when you pull into driveway at night. You're ashamed to be who you are. That will get you thinking about what you're doing, what you're not doing. And I learned a lot about my own shortcomings. I'm not a perfect person. I'm a much more self-aware person though than I was, that's for sure.
KURTZ: I can see that just in the exchange right now --
(LAUGHTER)
KURTZ: Exit question. Are you feeling the pressure?
CARLSON: I mean I guess. You know, I'm a pretty small thinker to be totally honest and I think if I thought a lot about, wow, you know, I'm anchoring the 9:00 p.m. on Fox News channel I would be pretty nervous but I tend to think about the show. What's the show tonight? What am I going to ask? What guest do we have as long as you keep thinking about that every single night, let's make the best show we can every day, you're fine.
KURTZ: I think the technical term was rock and roll. Tucker Carlson, great to see you.
CARLSON: Howard Kurtz. KURTZ: Thank you.
(END VIDEOTAPE)
KURTZ: Tucker will be on at 9:00 and Martha McCallum has a new show at 7:00 p.m. eastern with the first 100 days of the Trump presidency. Coming up, can Megyn Kelly succeed in two very different formats at NBC? And later, is it fair for journalist to call the president-elect a liar?
KURTZ: As we were saying, it was front page news this week when Megyn Kelly decided to leave Fox News for NBC where she'll launch a daytime talk show, host a Sunday night news magazine and join in special events coverage. Here's what Megyn said on ""The Kelly File"" about feeling a rapport with her audience.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
KELLY: But it's the kind of feeling that makes one feel connected to another human being, and that after all is why I believe we're here, human connection. The truth is, I need more of that in my life in particular when it comes to my children who are 7, 5 and 3. So, I'll be leaving Fox News at the week's end and starting a new adventure.

KURTZ: Joining us now from New York is Joe Concha, media reporter for ""The Hill."" And Joe, let's start with the obvious, Megyn Kelly was a huge star here. Number two show on cable news. What's the impact on Fox?
JOE CONCHA, MEDIA REPORTER, THE HILL: Impact on Fox, Howie, I don't think will be a heck of a lot believe it or not. You know, Fox, I compare to the University Of Alabama football program this week because Alabama keeps playing for championships every year yet their graduating players are going to the NFL and I looked at these two examples. Glenn Beck leaves in 2011, there's a gaping hole at 5:00 highly rated host.
Fox takes off their bench five people, puts them around the table and says talk about stuff, an attempt at eclipsing Beck and being a highly rated show. Same thing with Greta Van Susteren, she leaves 7:00 o'clock, they have Brit Hume on their bench. They fill in until Election Day, then Tucker Carlson comes in and obliterates the ratings that Greta had if you compare them year over year. I think the bottom line is Howie, that Fox does not rebuild, it reloads, and that's scary if you're a competitor.
KURTZ: Right. My former colleague (INAUDIBLE) by the way, starting a show at MSNBC. Some people say that Megyn Kelly left for money. Fox News offered her $100 million package over four years, is believed she's taken so much less money to go with NBC.
I think a lot of this was about her schedule, her life and the three kids that you heard her mention. You heard my interview with Tucker Carlson. He's only had his own show here for a few weeks. He gets the 9:00 p.m. slot, how do you see that working out?
CONCHA: If we're looking at December ratings, if we're looking at what Tucker Carlson has done since he took over on November 14th, we have never seen, Howie, a debut like Tucker Carlson has had for his show. Not just ratings which have been off the charts, but also it seems like every day I'm seeing a viral video of a segment that he does the night before debating somebody.
So I think Tucker certainly is going to be just fine and may even a clip -- Megyn's right, but to your point about Megyn though, you're exactly right, this was about her children. This is why you leave primetime for daytime for less money. We've never seen this with a broadcast journalist before at the top of her career.
I read her book cover to cover. I interviewed her a couple of weeks ago. It is an inescapable thing. She wanted to be there when her kids were getting home from school, doing their homework and tuck them into bed at night and that's why you take less money.
KURTZ: Let jump in. Yes. OK, but now she's going to be starting a daytime talk show which has been sort of a graveyard period for some pretty amous and successful journalists, how do you see her fairing?
CONCHA: Exactly Howie. Look at (INAUDIBLE) here, Anderson Cooper, big name, has a show in daytime to do a talk show like Megyn is going to try to do. It fails in two years. Katie Curic with Jeff Zucker producing before he was CNN president it fails in two years.
But here's why it's not an apples to apples comparison, 12 years ago, Megyn Kelly in her 30's with not television experience whatsoever, leaves the corporate lawyer job for television and years later becomes one of the most watched people in television. So, while it's going to be a big challenge for her Howie, I wouldn't bet against her if her own personal history is any indication.
KURTZ: And just recently starting a Sunday night news magazine show for NBC, of course Sunday night is ""60 Minutes"" night so, tough competition is now head to head.
CONCHA: Yes, ""60 Minutes"" has been around for nearly 50 years. It's been a perineal top 10 show. So you say I put it on later, right? Well, the problem is that NBC has the number one rated show in Sunday night football from September to January.
So, where are you going to put that show? So certainly, there are some unanswered questions as far as how NBC is going to utilize Megyn Kelly. She's going to be on in daytime. We don't know the time slot there too. We're going to find out probably sometime around September exactly what NBC's plan is for one Megyn Kelly.
KURTZ: All right. Well I wish Megyn Kelly all the best having been on her show and collaborating with her so many times. I wish you all the best too, Joe Concha, and you probably fed Tucker Carlson's ego as I was kidding him during our conversation.
All right, after the break, ""Wall Street Journal"" editor Gerry Baker on taking flack for his approach of covering Donald Trump's misstatements. And later, Joe Scarborough wants you to know he was not partying with Donald Trump on New Year's Eve.
KURTZ: Gerard Baker of the ""Wall Street Journal"" set off a bit of a furor when the subject of Donald Trump's veracity and how the press should cover any inaccurate comments surface on ""Meet The Press.""
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: If somebody says just an outright pulse (ph) said when you say the word lie, is that important to start putting in reporting or not?
GERALD BAKER, EDITOR, WALL STREET JOURNAL: Well, I'd be careful about using the word lie. Lie implies much more than just saying something that's false. It implies a deliberate intent to mislead.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
KURTZ: I spoke to the ""Wall Street Journal's"" editor-in-chief earlier from New York.
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
KURTZ: Gerry Baker, welcome.
BAKER: Thanks for having me.
KURTZ: You got a torrent of media criticism for those comments about whether or when the press should accuse the president-elect of being a liar. In fact, you say in the Journal, ""you stand accused of imperiling the Republic by adapting a craven defense of presidential mendacity. How do you plead, sir?
BAKER: Well, I thought I was going to be a fugitive from media justice for a while and I was wondering whether I should go and lie low. Thank you very much for your concern. I've weathered it OK so far.
KURTZ: Well, my favorite line in your column which you responded to this in the ""Wall Street Journal"" after Dan Rather called you deeply disturbing is the following, ""I will confess to feeling a little burst of pride at being instructed in reporting ethics by Mr. Rather. It feels a little like being lectured on the virtues of abstinence by Keith Richards."" How so?
BAKER: Well, I mean, again, look, we're in the media and Howie you know what it's like, you expect criticism from all sides. It's a little bit rich to be honest with you to be criticized for reporting ethics especially after something like this which where I'm convinced that we're doing the right thing by someone who remember, who had his employment terminated by a network because he was involved in making up a story about President George W. Bush. So, for me to be criticized by somebody like that, I actually -- I should say I took it what you say grace, a very small modicum of pride.
KURTZ: But certainly a story that couldn't be confirmed that with CBS had to retract. Now, the ""Journal's"" did --
BAKER: Yes, they didn't think it was true.
KURTZ: The ""Journal's"" editorial page has actually been pretty tough on Donald Trump, has pointed out some statements that are sort of inconsistent with the facts for example mass illegal voting in the election, the birther conspiracy against President Obama, but there's a difference you say, between your knowing that something is a lie using the word knowing in quote. The paper describing it that way and explain the different distinction.
BAKER: Well look, first of all, politicians speak untruths all the time. Lots of people speak untruths a lot of the time and we report that and so the right thing to do, I believe, is to say, when someone says something we report what they say -- someone as important as Donald Trump, the president-elect, which we reported and we then measure what he says, examines what he says against the facts, and we give an estimate as to whether or not that as far as we can tell, that statement is true.
And several times in the last year Donald Trump has said things that frankly aren't true. There is a difference though between saying that a person, a subject said something that was untrue and saying that they lied because lying is a -- to know that someone is lying, you have to know their state of knowledge and you have to know their state of mind, that they had deliberate intent to deceive.
Now, you may be able to infer from a lot of what you know, a lot of what you think you know to when somebody says something is untrue and Donald Trump says what he said about Muslims on the roofs of New Jersey celebrating 9/11. That's untrue. You may even think it's a lie. I'm not prepared to report it's a lie because that's a much, much, much higher standard of proof.
KURTZ: Just briefly, do you think there would have been this media criticism if you had said something similar about Hillary Clinton had she won the election, what does this say about the media's mind set toward president elect?
BAKER: I think you're absolutely right, Howie. I think look, I mean the first thing also is all politicians they've lied all of the time, you know. We didn't get any criticism at all when President Obama said if you like your health insurance plan you can keep your health insurance. If you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor. We didn't describe that as a lie. It was an untruth but we didn't describe that as a lie.
We haven't described things that Donald Trump has said as a lie. I think the answer, Howie, as what you're getting at is a large section of the media have decided that there is something specifically and uniquely threatening and malevolent about Donald Trump that they actually have to take a posture of confrontation and opposition to him and they have to be going out -- they have to be in the arena --
KURTZ: Right.
BAKER: -- and actually saying this man is a terrible threat to our freedoms and to our democracy and they have to be out there actually in a partisan way disagreeing with him.
KURTZ: Gerry baker, great to have you on the show. Thanks very much for joining us.
BAKER: Thanks, Howie. Thanks for having me.
(END VIDEOTAPE)
KURTZ: Still to come, how the ""Washington Post"" botched a scary story about the Russians supposedly hacking our electrical grid and Joe Scarborough calls a reporter a liar for tweeting about his relationship with Donald Trump.
KURTZ: The ""Washington Post"" made a dramatic headline last week, ""Russian hackers penetrated U.S. electricity grid through a utility in Vermont, U.S. officials say."" But the story quickly short circuited. And the danger here -- lesson is about the danger in relying on anonymous intelligent sources and not getting a comment from a key player. Now, 90 minutes after the paper posted the story saying the discovery -- there was a discovery of a computer code associated with Russian hackers that reflected ""a potentially serious vulnerability for America's electric grid,"" the utility said only a single line of code was found at one laptop not connected to the Burlington grid.
The Post softened its headline and the next day ran an editor's note but this week essentially retracted the entire story in a piece headline, ""Russian government hackers do not appear to have targeted Vermont utility say people close to the investigation."" The Post spokesman wouldn't comment to us but told the paper there have been internal discussions to make sure something similar doesn't happen again.
And now, bad week for the ""Washington Post."" Its ""Express"" tabloid does a cover splash on the women's march plan to go protest Trump's inauguration and uses the universal symbol for the male gender. Do the editors need their eyesight checked?
Joe Scarborough had dinner with Donald Trump last week and then he and his MSNBC co-host, Mika Brzezinski, met with the president-elect at Mar-a-Lago as a New Year's Eve party was getting underway. When CBS reporter Sopan Deb twitted that ""Morning Joe's"" host partied with Trump, the former GOP congressman called him a liar and then explained on the air that they didn't get dressed up or anything. It was just a 20-minute meeting seeking an interview.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
SCARBOROUGH: Well, judging from the response that I get every time I meet with anybody associated with him, no journalist have ever done this before. ""60 Minutes"" has ever gone to a president or a principal or the ""New York Times"" and certainly Tom Brokaw never did and we know Ben Bradley (ph) never did, but I'm just not going to let them lie because they've been lying for years so, you go meet the president-elect when the staff says you can meet the president-elect.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
KURTZ: That's true. Every president holds lots of off the record chats with journalists and commentators, Reagan, Bush, Clinton, Obama, this is only controversial because it's Trump. Now, Scarborough and the president- elect have had a stormy relationship over the past year so I'm glad they've patched things up.
Hey, Trump even went over to (INAUDIBLE) on Friday and met with them on ""Vanity Fair"" editor Graydon Carter who has been mocking him since the spy magazine days in the 80's, this after he had tweeted about Graydon, ""no talent, will be out!""

0	1	 2 von 72	Fox News Network	January 8, 2017 Sunday	 SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES	 10:00 AM EST		"MARIA BARTIROMO, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: Good morning.
The work begins on putting President-elect Donald Trump's cabinet picks through their paces.
Hi, everyone. I'm Maria Bartiromo. Welcome to ""Sunday Morning Futures"". We're live this morning from Los Angeles. And we're watching Capitol Hill, as lawmakers are set to hold a series of meetings and hearings this upcoming week, with confirmation process in full swing.
We're talking to former House Speaker Newt Gingrich this morning on how this might unfolded. Big week ahead.
Plus, a blockbuster intelligence report saying that Vladimir Putin was personally involved in hacking the United States presidential election. How convincing is this evidence? How should the U.S. respond now? We will talk to a member of the Senate Armed Services. 
And Republicans gearing up to repeal Obamacare, but what exactly will replace it? House Majority Whip Steve Scalise with us live right now.
(MUSIC)
BARTIROMO: All that coming up.
But, first, the Senate gears up for a busy week, this upcoming week. It is kicking off confirmation hearings for President-elect Trump's cabinet in waiting. Many of these picks could face intense scrutiny from Democrats, including Attorney General Nominee Jeff Sessions, Secretary of State Nominee Rex Tillerson.
For more on what to expect, let's bring in Newt Gingrich right now, former speaker of the House and a FOX News contributor.
Mr. Speaker, always a pleasure. Good to see you.
NEWT GINGRICH (R), FORMER SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE: It's good to be with you.
BARTIROMO: What are you expecting from these confirmation hearings next week?
GINGRINCH: Oh, I think that left will try to go after Sessions a little bit. They'll try to go after Tillerson. But on balance, I think that Mitch McConnell arranged this perfectly. He's putting so many of these initial hearings at the same time that it would almost impossible to build any really solid drama. Most of them will go through totally unscathed, and I suspect that they will have a substantial number approved on the day of the inauguration or within 48 hours after that.
So, there will be a couple of big fights. Certainly, the attorney general from Oklahoma is ahead of the Environmental Protection Agency, gets every environmentalist crazed. I have say that Betsy DeVos, who is a remarkable leader, has spent million of the dollars of her own money trying to help poor children get to schools, give them a chance to learn. She's going to be probably deeply opposed by teachers union, but I think she will go through, and people will recognize that she is a true champion for children having the right to have a decent education. But that will be one of the skirmishes that will come up.
BARTIROMO: Talk to us about the challenge that is really realistic. I mean, the 51 votes now needed because, of course, the Democrats changed that from 60 votes. You know, it appears to me that if they -- if the Democrats push back on all of his nominees, they should have lost credibility on all of it.
GINGRICH: Well, first of all, 51 votes because of Democrats on changes is all that McConnell needs and he's going to get 51 voters on virtually everybody.
I think that you're gong to have Joe Manchin, who is from the state where Trump got the highest percentage. I think he got 68 percent in West Virginia. Manchin is a conservative Democrat. I think he is likely to vote for almost all of these people. He has already publicly repudiated the Democratic left wing idea of opposing all these folks, and dragging it out for months. So, that gives them extra vote.
I think you have several Democrats, senator from North Dakota is running for reelection at a state that is very, very Republican, very pro-Trump. I don't know how many of those. You know, Claire McCaskill in Missouri, in a state that's very pro-Trump, I'm not sure how many of those want to go out and be leading the anti-Trump senators.
So, my hunch is after all of the noise, the hard left, the Elizabeth Warrens and, you know, the Bernie Sanders, will make lots of noise. They won't have the votes. Schumer has to pander to his left.
I wrote a column on Friday, I do two newsletters a week at Gingrich Productions and this was also printed at FOXNews.com, describing him a Senator No, and saying that the reason he is ""Senator No"" is that his left will not give him room to maneuver. He's got to go through a period of fighting with Trump. And, of course, they have known each other for many years. So, Trump is currently calling him a clown.
You know, we'll see how long that relationship takes to change. Schumer will not stay totally negative for very many months. It's not his personality, he knows in long run it's a losing proposition.
BARTIROMO: And he called him a clown after Schumer said that the cabinet was rigged. I mean, I don't know how you come up with rigged.
GINGRICH: Well, cabinet was rigged in sense that a conservative populous president-elect picked people who fit his values and his ideology. So, if you are a left wing, pro-big government, pro-radical values Elizabeth Warren, this is a rigged group. Just as, by the way, if Hillary Clinton had been elected, she would have rigged cabinet to the left.
BARTIROMO: Yes.
GINGRICH: You're going to see the same thing come up with judges. And there, Schumer has been clear that he can't imagine Trump picking a judge he would -- justice for the Supreme Court, he would vote for. And I say fine.
BARTIROMO: Right.
GINGRICH: Let's define who the hard left is, and the country overwhelmingly wants to see that position filled. And actually, even this morning, in one poll, 57 percent of Democrats want do see Trump succeed.
So, I think that Democrats are going against headwinds of popular opinion.
BARTIROMO: Yes. OK. So, you think Jeff Sessions, Rex Tillerson, you think they get confirmed.
GINGRICH: Absolutely.
BARTIROMO: I want to move on -- I want to move on to Russia. Donald Trump, obviously, put out a series of tweets on heels of the intelligence report.
Here is one of them, ""Having a good relationship with Russia is a good thing. Not a bad thing. Only stupid people or fools would think that it is bad. We have enough problems in the world without yet another one. When I am president, Russia will respect us, far more than they do now. And both countries will perhaps work together to solve the many great and pressing problems and issues of the world.""
What can Russia and U.S. do together? How important is a relationship with Russia? A positive one as it relates to the economy, as it relates to military?
GINGRICH: Well, look, the Russians can either cause a great deal of difficulty, arming the Iranians for example, continuing their activities in Syria, threatening eastern Ukraine, threatening potentially the Baltic states who are in NATO. So, there are a lot of ways the Russians can be a challenge to us.
On other hand, I think you have to question, well, what is Putin trying to achieve? He has said publicly recently, in response to a Donald Trump tweet, that the United States is clearly the most powerful country in the world -- that would I think a big step back for him. And I think that it is clear, Trump made this clear a couple of weeks ago, if Putin wants to have an arms race, we'll drown him.
Particularly, if the Trump economy policy takes off and we start at 5 percent, 6 percent real growth, we'll generate so much wealth, we will easily be able to deal with the Russians. You're going to have in General Mattis, soon to be Secretary Mattis, a secretary of defense, who understands exactly how to be either friendly or very tough, and letting the other guy pick which he prefers. I'm not so sure Putin won't decide that he'd like to try and experiment of actually working with us rather than trying to compete with us.
But I think you have to be very careful. Reagan had the right tone, he talked about trust, but verify. I think that, you know, Trump has to enter every conversation with Putin with that attitude, I would like to work with you, but it's got to be real. If you don't work with us, we're going to find a way to drown you.
BARTIROMO: Right. Do you expect the sanctions against Russia to be rolled back?
I mean, look, we know that Rex Tillerson had to deal with Russia, like he had to deal with a lot of ""mad men"" around the world, to try to get access to those countries for ExxonMobil when he was running ExxonMobil. He was not happy when the sanctions were put in place. A lot of people wondering if those sanctions should be rolled back.
What do you think?
GINGRICH: Well, I think, first of all, it's weird the other day that President Obama, extended, you know, penalties and kicked out 35 diplomats and so forth, a week before he got the intelligence report. I mean, that struck she ha me as stupid and a sign he is just carrying out his own prejudices. He's not carrying out any kind of informed policy.
I think that sanctions could be rolled back if Russians agreed to change some much their behavior. You know, if they got out of eastern Ukraine, and allowed for honest, local elections supervised by the Ukrainian government, and the level of violence there ceased, that would be a very big step towards a better future. If they agree to focus on trying too defeat ISIS, that's a positive sign.
And they have a huge Islamic supremacist problem with the Chechens. So, they -- and they've had suffered hundreds and hundreds of casualties in some very tragic situations.
BARTIROMO: Yes.
GINGRICH: So, they do have a real understanding of how dangerous Islamic supremacism can be. There are some grounds for thinking we could find ways to work together.
BARTIROMO: Newt, great to see you. Thanks so much.
GINGRICH: Good to be with you.
BARTIROMO: We appreciate it. Former speaker of the House, New Gingrich.
And, of course, President-elect Trump continues to be push back on President Obama's intelligence officials who say there is no doubt Russia did it. What do we know specifically? We will talk with a senator who was involved in this week's hearing on Capitol Hill.
Up next, North Carolina Senator Thom Tillis with us.
Follow me on Twitter @MariaBartiromo. Let us know what you would like to hear from Senator Tillis, @SundayFutures. Send me a tweet.
Stay with us. We're looking ahead right now on ""Sunday Morning Futures.""
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIPS)
JAMES CLAPPER, DIRECTOR OF NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE: Both the government and the private sector have done a lot to improve cyber security, and our collective security is better but it's still not good enough. Our federal partners are stepping up their efforts with private sector, but sharing of what they have remains uneven. I think the private sector needs to up its game on cyber security, and not just wait for the government to provide perfect warning or a magic solution.
ADM. MICHAEL ROGERS, NSA DIRECTOR: The biggest frustration to me is speed, speed, speed. We have got to get faster. We have got to be more agile. We can't be bound by history and tradition here, so to speak. We have to be willing to look at alternatives.
(END VIDEO CLIPS)
BARTIROMO: That was top intelligence officials talking about challenge of addressing foreign cyberattacks on United States during hearings on the Hill this past week. This as they release a new report describing a, quote, ""multifaceted campaign by Russian hackers to disrupt our presidential election.""
Joining me right now is Senator Thom Tillis of North Carolina, a member of the Armed Services and Judiciary Committees, also at that hearing last week.
Senator, good to see you. Thanks very much for joining us.
SEN. THOM TILLIS (R), NORTH CAROLINA: Good morning, Maria.
BARTIROMO: First question: how long has Russia been hacking the United States?
TILLIS: Oh, for years. Really, the advent of the Internet, for all the good that it's brought, has allowed penetration opportunities that nations are taking advantage of. So, this is not new. This has been going on for years.
We have a number of instances that we've been briefed on, and presences are increasing. Thirty nations now have some level of cyberattack capabilities across the globe. It's a real threat and we need to focus on that.
BARTIROMO: You know, I remember years ago, an insider from the Hank Paulson Treasury told me that treasury staffers were not allowed to take their BlackBerrys or their iPhones to Russia when they did a trip to Russia, because as soon as you enter airspace, Russian airspace, they have access everything, all of our information.
And so, if this has been going on for so many years, how come we're talking about it right now so much? How come all of a sudden, we've got a religion on this?
TILLIS: Well, I think that hacking of the DNC website to the extent Russia played a role in that, it just caused everybody to have their attention that. I will tell you that when we travel international, and we tell all U.S. citizens, any country you go to, understand you're probably going to get hacked and there's going to be an attempt, not just a nation like Russia, but anywhere you may travel to what we consider to be friendly nations.
But I do think the hacking and the election last year had a positive effect to really educate the American people that this is a pervasive threat, both in the public and private sector.
BARTIROMO: So, it's not just Russia. It's also China. It's others.
Senator, what specifically do they want? What are they looking for from the U.S.? What are they trying to get in all of this hacking?
TILLIS: Well, Maria, it's similar to the presences, the covert operations that most nations have in other countries, they are out there, they are listening, they're looking, and potentially being positioned to take advantage of an opportunity. Incidentally, the United States is out, has these presences as well and we need to.
So, some of it can just be trying to find patterns, no different from human intelligence would on the battle field, or in foreign nations where we're trying to understand and predict where their country may be that has had mal intent is headed and try to head them off.
BARTIROMO: So, now, the question is, what do we do about it? What is your recommendation? What should the U.S. be doing, now that we know what we know and, by the way, what we knew five years ago?
TILLIS: Well, I think in intro to this segment, Director Clapper and Admiral Rogers got it right. First, we have to recognize the private sector needs to step up. They can't wait for the government to protect them. They're on the internet. They're taking advantage of it. They also have to make sure that the customer information of their systems are secure.
Admiral Rogers made a very good point. You know, in the old days, weapon systems would take a decade or more before you could fill them. Weapon systems in the cyberspace can take 24 hours before you have a new threat that you have to be prepared to react to. We've got to make sure that we give our cyber command the tools that they need to be agile and responsive in these threats.
We're better prepared to do it than any other nation but the gap is closing, particularly with nations like Russia, China, Iran and North Korea.
BARTIROMO: So, why haven't we done it already, Senator?
TILLIS: Well, we have, but difference here, and I was explaining this in the Senate Armed Services Committee -- in the past, you would see a major threat in a form of a new ship or a new missile or a new plane, and you would design defensive measures to deal with that threat. But nature of threat changes literally in 24 hours cycles. You never know when an update on a operating system or an app on the Internet isn't providing some sort of presence or backdoor that allows someone with malicious intent to leverage it.
So, it's a very different threat than we've ever, and congressmen need to understand that, so that when we talk about defensive measures, we're not necessarily talking about a war in cyberspace, we are talking about sanctions and other actions that we can take for their to be a consequence when we got a smoking gun.
BARTIROMO: Yes, I'd say. Senator, it's good to have you on the program. Thanks very much for the information.
TILLIS: Thank you.
BARTIROMO: We'll see you soon, Senator Thom Tillis there.
Repealing Obamacare, high on the GOP agenda. The work is beginning there right now. Could their efforts to be stymied by the lack of a replacement plan? Up next, majority whip Steve Scalise on what's next for health care.
We're looking ahead right now on ""Sunday Morning Futures.""
BARTIROMO: Welcome back.
A Republican-controlled Congress taking steps almost immediate in new session to repeal Obamacare. But the mission to dismantle President Obama's signature law may face an uphill battle without an immediate replacement plan in place.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
REP. PAUL RYAN (R-WI), SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE: Our legislating on Obamacare, our repealing and replacing and transitioning, the legislating will occur this year. What date all of this gets phased in on is something we do not now know.
SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY), MINORITY LEADER: Republicans will soon learn you can't keep the good parts of the ACA and remove the rest of the law and still have it work.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
BARTIROMO: Joining us right now is Congressman Steve Scalise of Louisiana, the House Majority Whip.
Congressman, it is good to have you on the program. Welcome.
REP. STEVE SCALISE (R-LA), HOUSE MAJORITY WHIP: Good morning, Maria. Good to be back with you.
BARTIROMO: So, do you agree with Senator Schumer? You can't keep the good parts and still repeal.
SCALISE: Well, what Senator Schumer wants to try to ignore is the fact that Obamacare has failed the American people. Millions of people have already lost their health care. And those that are on Obamacare facing massive increases in their premiums every year. Here in Louisiana, 25 percent increase families are playing over last year because of these unworkable laws.
So, the first thing you've got to do is gut this law, repeal Obamacare, and then replace it. Let's go back to the beginning of replacing it with reforms that actually focus on lowering costs and putting patients in charge of their health care decisions with their doctors.
BARTIROMO: No doubt about it. The cost has been bankrupting small business. I mean, you know, the worst of it all we know is Arizona, where they're going to see an increase of 116 percent this year.
But how split are the Republicans right now in terms of what to do about it? Do you need to have a plan to replace it at the same time of repeal?
SCALISE: I think everyone recognizes there will be a transition period, and President-elect Trump and our leaders have said nobody is going to get the rug pulled out from underneath from them. You first have to go and gut the law, though. And then you start putting in place reforms, some of them you can pass through the legislative process. Some of them can be done administratively.
But the long and the short of it is, you've got to reset the marketplace that is destroyed by Obamacare. You know, when Nancy Pelosi said you have to pass the bill to find out what was in it, there was a reason they said that, because when you look at what's in the bill it just does not work for families.
I mean, even if you have a plan right now in Obamacare, you are probably paying a $10,000 or $12,000 deductible. That's not care. It might be an insurance card but it's not something that that helps your family. So, let's actually focus on those things like, for example, Maria, buying insurance across state lines, like health savings accounts, which have been recognized all the across the country, as helping reducing cost and empower employees and yet, Obamacare guts HSAs.
Let's actually focus on maybe allowing a lot of pools, whether it's small business pooling together, your church groups can pull together, to have the same buying power as a large company. Those are some of the things that are included in our replacement, and I think people are going to be excited when they actually see not just us moving forward on repealing Obamacare, but also on these really neat elements that would focus on lowering costs, that have been shut out by Obamacare, that we're going to engage the American people on seeing just what healthcare should be. And we're going to help bring in place as we put this plan forward quickly.
BARTIROMO: I want to read to what you Senator Bob Corker said of Tennessee, because he's saying that Republicans might find themselves in a box cannon if they incrementally replace parts of the law, saying that congressional Republicans having to take an unpopular vote to increase taxes, if for example they repeal part of Obamacare that increases taxes on higher wage earnings, but temporarily continue subsidies in the law that help lower incomes buy the coverage.
Is that on the table, raising taxes?
SCALISE: No. We're not raising taxes. In fact, Obamacare dramatically raised taxes. That was one of he many bad things about Obamacare that has hurt our economy. It's crippled our economy in many ways. It hurts the ability for small businesses to hire people. Let's get rid of that broken law.
And again, all throughout this process, we're not only going to be talking about what healthcare should be and what it can be. Under our plan, but also reminding people just how broken Obamacare is. Just how much it has devastated families. I've got so many families in my district in southeast Louisiana that have shown me the cancellation notices, they had the plan.
Remember, all of Barack Obama's broken promises, when he came here just the other day. I said, let's remember what he said when he first came to the capitol. If you like what you have, you can keep it. If you like your doctor, you can keep it. Cost will be $2,500 lower.
Every one of those promises was broken by Barack Obama under Obamacare. He should be apologizing for this law, not holding with this last breath to try to salvage this part of his legacy. It's a failed part of his legacy.
We want to close this chapter, start new with a fresh approach that is more focused on putting patients in charge of their decision with doctors and lower costs, than having the government decide what your health care plans should look like.
BARTIROMO: Do you believe you will replace and repeal Obamacare in 2017?
SCALISE: Well, we have put forward as a plan that would repeal the law, then replace it over course of next few months. The transition period, if you look at bill we put on Barack Obama's desk about a year and a half ago. We put a bill on Barack Obama's desk to gut Obamacare, and by the way, defund Planned Parenthood.
He vetoed that bill, but that bill had about a two-year transition period so that you could be working on putting in place a different and better health care system. So, that's a benchmark of what we're looking at again. So, it's not -- again, not just repealing Obamacare, but also defunding Planned Parenthood. I think two things that people are really excited about seeing.
BARTIROMO: All right. We will be watching the developments, Congressman. Good to have you on the program. Thanks so much.
SCALISE: Always good to be back, Maria.
BARTIROMO: Congressman Steve Scalise joining us.
Markets have been anticipating big things from Trump administration. We are looking at dollar which had been soaring until a hit this past week. Is the so-called Trump rally still in place? We'll take a look and look at economic growth with former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, coming up.
BARTIROMO: Welcome back.
Lowering taxes and moving the needle on economic growth, that is the focus of President-elect Trump's economic plan. But my next guest has some issues with it.
Joining me right now to talk about it is Larry Summers, the former U.S. treasury secretary.
Larry, it's good to have you on the program. Welcome back.
LARRY SUMMERS, FORMER U.S. TREASURY SECRETARY: Good to be with you, Maria.
BARTIROMO: So, we're talking about four-pronged plan, which Donald Trump has to discuss, taking the corporate tax rates to 15 percent, rolling back regulations, redoing trade deals and tapping into energy resources. What do you think the impact will be?
SUMMERS: I think much won't happen because it won't make it through the legislative process and won't prove feasible. And I think a fair part of what does happen will be counterproductive overtime.
You know, the experience, Maria, is that populist policies work for a time and then they ultimately backfire. I think that Trump corporate tax plan would huge increase inequality, would likely have some very perverse effects on a number of sectors in the economy. Such as retailing, could ironically by sending dollar way up, make situation much worse for workers in the Midwest who are competing with Mexico, who are competing with Japan.
I think that deregulation in some areas like finance, is hugely dangerous, who wants to go back to era of predatory lending? Who wants to go back to an era of vastly over levered banks? So, I think there is a lot to question here and I think particularly dangerous because of what it means for relations between nations is some of the unilateral ideas on Trump, on trade to wall off America. That the president-elect has put forward.
There's -- we've seen that experiment before from Herbert Hoover and it didn't work well. I think we need to be very, very careful here about what we do. Of course, we need to enforce our trade agreements.
BARTIROMO: Right.
SUMMERS: Of course, we need to be tough. But, right now, what's going on happen is the United States is going to step back, and other countries are going to move in. I don't see how that serves our objectives.
BARTIROMO: But move in where, Larry? I mean, everybody wants to sell to the United States. Where are they moving in?
SUMMERS: Oh, the rules are going to set by China in Asia. That's one example.
Second example is, because of, and you can track it very carefully in the timing, because of President-elect Trump's words and his election, the Mexican peso is depreciated by 20 percent. That means that every business deciding whether to locate in Ohio or Mexico is finding Mexico 20 percent cheaper. That's a huge tilt away from the United States.
So, you see it --
BARTIROMO: Right.
SUMMERS: -- both with respect to Mexico, and with respect to the form of these arrangements. There are going to be trade agreements between Asia and Europe.
BARTIROMO: Right.
SUMMERS: There are going to be more Chinese trade agreements from which we're going to be excluded.
BARTIROMO: Well, Donald Trump says he want to put America first. He said yesterday that he's got a meeting with Theresa May in the U.K. in next couple of weeks, he wants to put the British-U.S. alliance up front.
And, Larry, look at these markets, we've had 17 record highs since the election. There is an expectation out there that with lower taxes and a rollback of regulation, that businesses will use that money that they are saving to hire more workers, to invest in their business. We've seen businesses sit on cash these last several years.
You don't think they are going to unleash that cash with lower taxes?
SUMMERS: Two points, Maria. As far as United States and Britain are concerned, Britain is now a small economy by global standards. And if our global economic strategy is to trade only with people who speak English, that's going to be a poor strategy, relative to the strategy that China is pursuing, relative to strategy that Europe is pursuing.
With respect to breaks for businesses -- yes, the corporate tax rate does need to come down. But instead of that money flowing to top 1 percent that have been most successful, what we should be doing is raising the taxes on all income that's escaping taxation to the Cayman Islands and the like through a range of tax shelters.
BARTIROMO: OK.
SUMMERS: There is a case for corporate tax reform, but we need to do it in the right way. And, frankly, I think that the danger is that the deregulation that is being proposed the set the stage for the next financial crisis. And we have seen the damage that they could do not just immediately as in 2008, but over years and years, in terms of holding back the quantity of investment.
BARTIROMO: But, Larry, isn't there a case --
SUMMERS: There may be --
BARTIROMO: Yes?
SUMMERS: There may be a sugar high. But that is all it will be from the policies that are being suggested.
BARTIROMO: Isn't there a case to be made that we need manage something different? I mean, you know, the national debt has soared under Barack Obama's tenure from $10.6 trillion in January `09 to nearly $20 trillion today. I know that stimulus package after recession was parts of that. Real wages have remained stagnant, Larry. Six million manufacturing jobs have been lost since 2011 despite that huge infrastructure spending, and businesses have suffered under red tape and federal corporate tax rates, the highest in the world, the industrialized world.
Is it fair to say make the case, that something needs to give? That we need a different approach?
SUMMERS: Maria, did not realize you were part of the Trump P.R. operation --
BARTIROMO: Not at all, just looking at the numbers.
SUMMERS: That was a very eloquent speech.
BARTIROMO: I'm factual. I'm factual.
SUMMERS: We to need to change our strategy towards that emphasizes having prosperity bubble up rather than trickle down. There's no reason why the top priority in United States should be cutting taxes for companies at a time after profits have tripled. We need to broaden the tax base, as well as cut the rate.
No, there is not a case for savage deregulation from people who believe that global climate change is some kind of myth of the environment. No, there is not a case for wholesale financial deregulation that will let banks go back to the things that got them in trouble before 2007 and 2008 crisis. No, there is not a case for systemically erecting tariffs and other barriers to trade with other countries, at a time when anybody knows that our businesses don't just import products. They produce as part of global supply chains. And if we cut ourselves out of that global supply chains, and if we cut ourselves out of those global supply chains, we'll cut ourselves out of being competitive.
Are there elements of this that are right? Of course, there are. And I tell you one thing --
BARTIROMO: Right.
SUMMERS: -- which is again losing focus, that is renewing our country's infrastructure. Look at LaGuardia airport.
BARTIROMO: Yes, absolutely.
SUMMERS: Look at Kennedy Airport.
BARTIROMO: Yes.
SUMMERS: Look at the fact that Americans pay the equivalent of 70 cent gasoline tax each year in extra car repairs with extra pot holes because we're not doing or jobs. Those are important priorities to be addressing.
BARTIROMO: And he's talked about this infrastructure plan.
(CROSSTALK)
SUMMERS: His infrastructure plan is a --
BARTIROMO: Yes.
SUMMERS: -- Potemkin village of nothing. It is a --
BARTIROMO: A trillion dollars of nothing? Almost a trillion dollars.
We have to go. We're up against a hard break, but this is going to be an incredible experiment to watch, but it really is a completely approach than we've seen.
Always honor and pleasure, Larry. Thanks very much for joining us.
SUMMERS: Good to be with you, Maria.
BARTIROMO: Larry Summers there.
We'll take a short break, and we're talking next up with former A.G., Michael Mukasey. Stay with us.
BARTIROMO: Welcome back.
Senator Jeff Sessions will be headed to Capitol Hill this week. It's going to be a big week for what could be a contentious set of hearings to confirm him as the next attorney general.
I want to bring in Judge Michael Mukasey right now, former attorney general under President George W. Bush.
And it is good to see you, Judge. Thanks so much for joining us.
MICHAEL MUKASEY, FORMER U.S. ATTORNEY GENERAL: Good to see you. Thank you for having me.
BARTIROMO: What are your expectations out of this hearing upcoming this week?
MUKASEY: Well, my expectations are that he should not have a hard time certainly on the merit. He has all of the experience you could hope for. He also has all of the qualities of mine and character that I think the job demand.
He was a United States attorney in the southern district of Alabama for 12 years. He was attorney general of Alabama. He served in Senate on the Oversight Committee that is actually having this hearing.
So, he served with these senators. He had direct oversight responsibility over the Justice Department, so he understands what it's about and what its problems are. And he is very much committed to its mission.
BARTIROMO: You know, in last several years, Judge, we have seen IRS target conservatives. We've seen the Department of Justice try to squash an investigation of Hillary Clinton, and her Clinton Foundation. We have seen so many government agents get politicized. In your view, how easy or tough is it going to be to unwind that politicizing of what we've seen in government?
MUKASEY: Well, from that standpoint, I think it's going to be relatively easy. I think he will be able to refocus the Justice Department on its job, which is enforcing the law, and enforcing it impartially. I think he will develop or restore good relationship between the Justice Department and state and local law enforcement authorities, which are suffering under what the FBI director called Ferguson Effect, which is the intense hostility that existed between some -- existed between some parts of justice department and state and local law enforcement that's resulted in police officers withholding or hesitating in getting involved in situations, and that operates to the detriment of minority communities that are hardest hit. I think we're going to see that stop.
BARTIROMO: Yes. Do you think, just based on numbers and in terms of votes required, do you think that the skeptics are going to be able to push back and change Donald Trump's proposed cabinet?
MUKASEY: I don't know about other positions in the cabinet. Frankly, I seriously doubt it. The Republicans have majority in the Senate. The -- Harry Reid did away with the filibuster as a tactic in opposing appointments like this. And there will be Democrats who I think will the support the areas of the president-elect's cabinet proposal.
I think, certainly, Jeff Sessions should not have any problem. People -- there will be hullaballoo from people who are -- have hurled false accusations against him in the past, and they very will do it in present. But I don't think it's going to affect him.
BARTIROMO: All right. We will leave there. We'll be watching. Always a pleasures, sir. Thanks very much for joining us.
MUKASEY: Good to be with you.
BARTIROMO: Former A.G. Michael Mukasey there.
President Obama preparing to give a farewell address as his time in office draws to a close. So, what kind of legacy does he leave behind?
The panel is deck to talk about it. We're looking ahead on ""Sunday Morning Futures"" right now.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Right now is that I'm busier than I expected these last two weeks. A great deal of emotion around the people that I've worked with and I think I will still feel that same appreciation for what Churchill and others have said is the worst form of government, except all the alternatives.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
BARTIROMO: That's President Obama today, preparing to give his farewell speech this upcoming week in Chicago, the city that launched his political career.
The panel is with me now. Tony Sayegh is a Republican political analyst, executive vice president of Jamestown Associates, and a FOX News contributor. Jessica Tarlov is a Democratic pollster and senior political strategist at Schoen Consulting. And former Massachusetts Senator Scott Brown is a FOX News contributor.
It's a pleasure to see you all. Thanks so much for joining us.
JESSICA TARLOV, DEMOCRTIC POLLSTER: Good morning.
TONY SAYEGH, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Good morning, Maria.
BARTIROMO: Senator Brown, kick us off here. President Obama's legacy?
SCOTT BROWN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, it really depends where you're sitting. I had a personal interaction obviously with the president. I think his legacy really begins in earnest in changing it when I won the election in Massachusetts, which took away super majority. And therefore, he wasn't able to ram through a lot of things that they tried to do, merge Obamacare, and as a result, you have Obamacare failing.
I think his legacy also will be one of being a divider rather versus uniter, missed opportunities. And then, also, when it comes to foreign policy, looking and really not supporting our allies and emboldening our foes by drawing lines and not fulfilling, you know, promises, that kind of an apology tour mentality.
And then, finally, putting his legacy, putting all of his policies in play in this election with Hillary Clinton really losing a third term, by having his policies rejected, which will, in fact, be rejected in first 50 to 70 to 100 days.
BARTIROMO: Yes, it's funny when you said I keep chuckling when I see President Obama say, I could have won if I a run a third term. He keeps talking a third term.
BROWN: He did. He did run. He did run.
BARTIROMO: Jessica Tarlov, your thoughts on his legacy.
TARLOV: My thoughts are more positive than Scott, but I think we knew that was going to happen. I think that President Obama will in his speech in Chicago reflect upon the economic gains that we've seen of his time, he'll talk about 70-plus months of private sector job growth. We just saw wages go up 2.9 percent this quarter.
And he will talk about Obamacare and the fact that now, polling shows we're just breaking even on popularity, which is actually a huge upswing for that. But that costs are rising at a slower pace than decade before Obamacare. He'll talk about 20-million-plus insured because of it. And, you know, hopefully, he'll also reflect on some of the challenges that still face us, going forward, but how important it is to make sure that you know Americans have affordable. And I know affordable is still in question at this point. But affordable care going forward, and I think he will also talk about climate change pact.
BARTIROMO: Well, I don't --
TARLOV: He has role there.
BARTIROMO: I mean, I think you make great points.
TARLOV: Thank you.
BARTIROMO: But, of course, we know that President-elect Trump is looking to reverse that.
TARLOV: He is --
(CROSSTALK)
BARTIROMO: I don't know that anyone would say that Affordable Care Act is actually affordable, right?
TARLOV: Well, no, I think, listen, premiums have gone up. They're going up at a slower rate than they were.
(CROSSTALK)
SAYEGH: Triple digits in some states.
TARLOV: No, if you listen to President-elect Trump, you listen to Kevin McCarthy, you listen to Kellyanne Conway, Republicans know that they cannot get rid of Obamacare without a plan to put in place of that. So --
SAYEGH: Maria --
BARTIROMO: Yes, Tony Sayegh?
SAYEGH: Let's go back to the legacy real quick.
BARTIROMO: Tony Sayegh, legacy.
SAYEGH: President Obama came into office on the theme of hope and change. And if you look at data, the most disappointing aspect of his presidency is more people after his eight years have less hope. That's the only thing that's really changed.
Seventy-six percent in a ""Wall Street Journal"" poll say they don't think their children will have as good an experience in this country as they did, a secure future as they did. Economically and if you look at record, I mean, anemic growth, 1.5 percent average, 9 percent drop in wages, Maria, that's one the reasons Donald Trump's populism was able to win, explosive death, added more than all of his predecessors combined.
But the real problem is, he replaced the American doctrine, held by Republicans and Democrats of peace through strength, with the doctrine of chaos and weakness, from Iran to the retreat in Iraq that led to ISIS, the complete chaos we have now basically because Russia has reasserted itself.
This is the most unfortunate part of the legacy. But I think Senator Brown hit on something. Forget about just policy failures, spiritually, this is a man who came to office in a very special way, at a very special time, and he could have united us. But instead, he chose to take his power and divided us on lines of race, class and political division and that's saddest part of the Obama legacy.
TARLOV: He did that by himself, right? Republicans have nothing to do with what happened.
SAYEGH: Well, he was a big leader in that.
TARLOV: Well, we should also mention that he is first African-American president and that will be a crucial part of his legacy I think going forward.
BROWN: Of course. Maria?
BARTIROMO: Well, for sure. Yes?
BROWN: Of course.
TARLOV: Oh, my God, everyone agrees.
BROWN: He was the African-American president and that's great. And he was to be president of everybody, he chose as just referenced, to divide us. We have many opportunities to move this country forward, I was there, Jessica, with all due respect --
BARTIROMO: We've got to jump.
BROWN: I was the most bipartisan -- I was most bipartisan senator there. There were many, many opportunities to work together. He only checked out by not visiting the Democrats --
BARTIROMO: Thank you, guys.
TARLOV: Thanks, Maria.
BARTIROMO: We've got to jump.
BROWN: -- to move our country forward. So --
BARTIROMO: Great panel. Appreciate it. Have a great Sunday. Thank you so much, everybody. That will do it for ""Sunday Morning Futures"". I'll see you tomorrow, Fox Business Network."

The U.S. intelligence community says Vladimir Putin ordered a cyber attack to interfere in our presidential election and help Donald Trump win -- as tension rises between the president-elect and the nation's spy chiefs.
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
JAMES CLAPPER, DIRECTOR OF NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE: I don't think that we've ever encountered a more aggressive or direct campaign to interfere in our election process. 
WALLACE: Today, incoming White House chief of staff Reince Priebus on Mr. Trump's rocky relationship with the intelligence community.
And the president-elect seems to find an ally and the founder of WikiLeaks.
SEN. CLAIRE MCCASKILL (D), MISSOURI: The notion that the elected -- the soon elected leader of this country would put Julian Assange on a pedestal.
WALLACE: We'll ask House Intelligence Committee Chair Devin Nunes about some conservatives embracing Assange and Mr. Trump's plans to overhaul the nation's spy agencies. It's a FOX NEWS SUNDAY exclusive.
Plus, we'll ask our Sunday panel about that horrific attack everyone is talking about -- four blacks torturing a mentally disabled white man live on Facebook.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (EXPLETIVE DELETED) Donald Trump (EXPLETIVE DELETED) white people.
WALLACE: All right now on FOX NEWS SUNDAY.
(END VIDEOTAPE)
WALLACE: And hello again from FOX News in Washington.
Russian President Vladimir Putin wanted to block Hillary Clinton. That's the blunt assessment of U.S. intelligence agencies on the Kremlin's effort to influence the 2016 election in Donald Trump's favor. An unclassified report now released after the nation's spy chiefs briefed Congress, President Obama and President-elect Trump.
In a moment, we'll get the Trump team's reaction from incoming White House chief of staff Reince Priebus.
But first, let's bring in chief intelligence correspondent Catherine Herridge with the latest on what the intel community found -- Catherine.
CATHERINE HERRIDGE, FOX NEWS CHIEF INTELLIGENCE CORRESPONDENT: Chris, the report has strong language, the tone is authoritative and most of the conclusions are at the high confidence level. The central finding is that Russian President Vladimir Putin authorized a campaign to undermine and influence the U.S. democratic process, with the goal of damaging Clinton and her chances of winning. Overtime, the Russians came to favor a Donald Trump victory.
The FBI Director James Comey, CIA Director John Brennan are very confident Putin wanted to help Mr. Trump. While the NSA Director Mike Rogers, whose agency analyzes signals intelligence, including intercepted phone calls, was only moderately confident.
The report says Russian intelligence provided the stolen emails to Julian Assange and his website WikiLeaks. Because of its self-proclaimed reputation for authenticity, Assange has consistently denied the Russian government connection.
Writing in a tweet after his classified briefing, the president-elect said there was absolutely no evidence that hacking affected the election results, voting machines not touched.
Though mentioning Russia, the vice president-elect said the briefing was useful.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
MIKE PENCE (R), VICE PRESIDENT-ELECT: It was a constructive and respectful dialogue. And the president-elect has made it very clear that we're going to take aggressive action in the early days of our new administration, to combat cyber attacks and protect the security of the American people.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
HERRIDGE: Senior congressional leadership known as the ""Gang of Eight"" was briefed but they did not see the underlying raw data -- Chris.
WALLACE: Catherine, I want to also ask you about the latest of that massacre Friday at Ft. Lauderdale Airport. Police say an Iraq war vet, Esteban Santiago, opened fire after retrieving a gun for his checked bag. Any evidence that this is terror-related?
HERRIDGE: Well, Chris, investigators have not ruled out terrorism and confirmed to FOX News that the FBI's main field office in Alaska investigated Santiago in November after he told agents that U.S. intelligence had infiltrated his mind and forced him to watch ISIS propaganda videos. No tie to terrorism was found. Santiago's mental state did not meet the legal standard for authorities to take his gun, and his erratic behavior was simply not enough for the no-fly list. He now faces three federal charges that each carry the possibility of death, Chris.
WALLACE: Catherine, thank you.
HERRIDGE: You're welcome.
WALLACE: One of the people in the room when President-elect Trump was briefed on the Russian campaign to disrupt our election is Reince Priebus, the incoming White House chief of staff.
And, Reince, welcome back to FOX NEWS SUNDAY.
REINCE PRIEBUS, INCOMING WHITE HOUSE CHIEF OF STAFF: Good morning, Chris.
The nation's intel chiefs laid out the full classified report to President- elect Trump and others in his team, including you that Russian president Vladimir Putin ordered a cyber attack to interfere with the election and eventually came to try to help Donald Trump.
Simple question: does the president-elect accept the findings and the evidence of the intelligence community?
PRIEBUS: Well, I think he accepts the findings, Chris. But here's the thing that I think everyone needs to understand -- when this whole thing started, it started from the Russians 50 years ago. In other words, this is something that's been going on in our elections for many, many years, both the Russians, the Chinese, the Iranians. It happens every election period.
Now, in this particular case, it started way back in 2015 before either nominee of either party was chosen, and it started, and this is declassified, as a spear phishing exhibition over many different institutions. It just so happened that the DNC had nearly no defenses on their system, and when they were warned multiple times by the FBI, they didn't respond.
And so, suddenly, you have a major political party, one of the biggest political parties in the world, that by their own admission lacked defenses, lacked training, and allowed a foreign government into their entire email system without responding to the FBI.
So, yes, we have bad actors around the world. We have had bad actors, including the Russians. But we also have a problem when we have a major political institution that allows foreign governments into their system with hardly any defenses or training. That's a huge story, and that's what people aren't talking about as well.
WALLACE: That's a fair point. And it's also, we should point out, there is no evidence that the Russians in any way were able to get into the electoral system and tamper with the vote count.
But on Friday, hours before he had the briefing, Donald Trump said that this was, quote, ""a political witch hunt"".
So, I just want to be very clear on two political points. Does he now accepts -- but you say, well, this has been going on for years, never to this extent, never the hacking and dissemination of emails, and you could argue as to whether they were in some way were complicit in it because of their weaknesses, that we've never had this kind of dissemination before. Does he accept that the Russians were behind this hacking campaign? Yes or no?
PRIEBUS: Well, sure. I mean, he's not denying that entities in Russia were behind this particular campaign. But let me just -- can you -- let me respond to your point, though. You say never have we had such a massive -- yes, but here's what we have. We have the DNC as a sitting duck.
So, if you have a person -- wait a second, because it matters to your point. It matters because if the DNC allows any foreign entity into their system, says, here is 50,000 emails, you can have them. Well, voila! Now, you have the biggest dissemination of emails that we've ever seen in the history of America because we have a revolving door at the DNC.
WALLACE: Who do you blame more for this? Who do you blame more for this, Reince? Do you blame Putin and the Kremlin? Or do you blame the DNC? Who is the primary actor here?
PRIEBUS: Well, listen, the primary actor is the foreign entity that's perpetrating the crime to begin with, no doubt about it.
WALLACE: Which was? Which was?
PRIEBUS: I'm not denying that.
WALLACE: Which was?
PRIEBUS: I'm not denying that. I'm not denying that.
WALLACE: And what was that foreign entity?
PRIEBUS: The thing is -- Russia.
But what I'm telling you is that we also have a situation where you have people at the DNC -- let me ask you this. Anyone listening out there, if you had multiple calls from the FBI and you said, ""By the way, Chris, this is the FBI, I think someone is in your system and stealing all of your emails"", and you ignore multiple, multiple calls.
They attempted to attack the RNC in the same way. They didn't get into our system because number one, we had our head straight and we had defenses at the RNC. But number two, when the FBI called the RNC and said, we've got a hacking situation, we brought them in immediately.
And so, granted we have bad actors around the world, and cyber attacks have been happening for years, but we also have an entity that's allowed through a wide open door a foreign government into their system.
WALLACE: I get that.
One other question.
PRIEBUS: Go ahead.
WALLACE: Does President-elect Trump accept the evidence that he heard, does he find it persuasive, that Putin's interest towards the end of the campaign was to help Trump by discrediting Clinton?
PRIEBUS: I haven't asked him about that, Chris. I mean, he accepts the fact that Russia and other entities engaged in cyber attacks on the United States all day long. He accepts the fact that this particular case was entities in Russia. So, that's not the issue.
But -- and if you look at his statement, after he commends the intelligence community in the very first paragraph, he talks about the particular hack. He talks about the fact that the DNC was a sitting duck while at the RNC had its act together. He then says in the first 90 days of his administration, he is going to order a full report as to what we can do to be better.
But one of the things we can do to be better is when the FBI calls you and says you have a problem, you return the phone call.
WALLACE: Well, I want to ask about that, because he said yesterday in which he said that we want to have better relations with Russia. I mean, if he accepts the fact that they, in an unprecedented way, tried to interfere with our election, does that mean he is not going to respond, he's not going to take action against Russia?
PRIEBUS: He very well, he's going to order the intelligence community to make recommendations, and whatever those recommendations are will be discussed and actions may be taken, but I don't think there's anything wrong with trying to have a good relationship with Russia and other countries around the world. And that's what the president is saying, that he is going to have good relationships around the world that will put America first, bring jobs back and make a safer across the globe. That's what he wants to do and I think that's what he will do.
WALLACE: I want to consider the question of the president-elect's relations, not with Russia, but with the intelligence community. Because here was a tweet that he put out on Tuesday. ""The, quote, `intelligence' briefly on the so-called, quote, `Russian hacking' was delayed until Friday. Perhaps more time needed to build a case. Very strange.""
This was the reaction from the director of national intelligence.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
JAMES CLAPPER, DIRECTOR OF NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE: I think there's a difference between the skepticism and disparagement.

WALLACE: Isn't that disparaging when the president-elect of the United States puts the word intelligence in quotes?
PRIEBUS: Well -- and Mr. Clapper also stated that there is no evidence in the report that any of this changed the outcome of the election.
But to your question, here's what happened -- the president of the United States, a week earlier, a few days earlier, took on an enormous and unprecedented sanctions against Russia. We then went into full gear to get an intelligence briefing on what the president knew that created that strong reaction, or what the briefing was that created that is sudden, strong reaction, and we were attempting to have that full-blown meeting on Tuesday.
WALLACE: I'm not asking about the schedule, Reince.
(CROSSTALK)
WALLACE: But wait a minute, I'm asking about why did he put the word intelligence quotes?
PRIEBUS: Because I'm getting to the point.
The reason he put it in quotes is that the intelligence briefing in quotes that we were attempting to have was going to be on Tuesday. It turns out, that the report, which apparently was supposed to be done that created the Obama reaction, wasn't going to be done until Wednesday, and therefore, the intelligence briefing in quotes that we were supposed to have on Tuesday was then, we were informed, was going to be done on Friday.
So, here we are having to react to these Russian sanctions stories with the media and all of you, folks, you -- and you're a good one, Chris. We were supposed to be reacting to something that we had no ability to get a briefing on because the actual report wasn't done until Wednesday. It's a frustrating situation and that's what the president-elect was referring.
WALLACE: Yes, but the question is the way the relationship that he has with the intelligence community, what even the DNI, General Clapper, saw as disparagement.
I want to ask you about something else, because the president-elect this week seemed to put more credibility to believe the founder of WikiLeaks over the intelligence community. And I want to put up another tweet that the president-elect said on Wednesday.
""Julian Assange said a 14-year-old could have hacked Podesta -- why was DNC so careless? Also said the Russians did not give him the info.""
Reince, several years back, I don't have to tell you, Julian Assange published, disclosed, hundreds of thousands of classified cables and other emails and documents that very much compromised the U.S. military in Iraq and that endanger the lives of hundreds of Afghan informants helping the U.S. military.
Why would the president-elect give any credibility to Julian Assange?
PRIEBUS: Well, first of all, to your other point, he has tremendous respect to the people in the intelligence community. In his statement on Friday, it was the very first thing he said, and he wanted to make it clear to everyone working hard in the interest of our foreign intelligence that he appreciates them very much.
As to Assange, he doesn't think this guy is a good guy. He put in quotes things that he had said. He didn't say I support this guy. He didn't say I think he's a good guy.
WALLACE: Why even quote him? Why even give him any credibility? He's the president-elect.
PRIEBUS: I think his point is that -- well, wait a second, I think his point is that the DNC was so lacking in any of their defenses, by their own admission.
WALLACE: OK, we got that. I'm just asking why he was --
PRIEBUS: Perhaps a 14-year-old could have gotten into the -- but perhaps a 14-year-old could have gotten into the DNC. When you have staffers opening up emails that say, you know, ""I'm stranded in Mali and I need $20,000, click on this link"", and the DNC is clicking on these links.
You know, I've got to tell you something, no one thinks that Assange is a great guy, I can assure you of that. But I think the issue here is yes, bad foreign actors, but it's also the DNC that has allowed itself to be hacked by about anyone in the world, and that is one of the reasons why this was such a big deal.
WALLACE: OK.
PRIEBUS: I don't think anybody is talking about it.
WALLACE: I want to get into one must area, we are running out of time. Has President-elect Trump given up on trying to work with Democrats?
PRIEBUS: Absolutely not. Absolutely not. In fact, another meeting --
(CROSSTALK)
WALLACE: Can I explain to why I'm asking the question?
PRIEBUS: Sure.
WALLACE: Because I'm curious as to why he sent out to go tweets this week. One referring to Schumer clowns, and another, the head clown, Chuck Schumer.
Here's what Vice President Biden said this week.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
JOSEPH BIDEN, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Grow up, Donald. Grow up. Time to be an adult. You're president. You've got to do something. Show us what you have.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WALLACE: How do you respond to the vice president and why on earth call Chuck Schumer a clown? How was that going to help you?
PRIEBUS: Well, first of all, Chuck Schumer and President-elect Trump have a long, long relationship together. Donald Trump has helped Chuck Schumer in his runs for Senate. Donald Trump has had massive fundraiser for Chuck Schumer at Mar-a-Lago many times before. They have a personal relationship.
And I've got to tell you -- I mean, when Senator Schumer says that he is going to allow the vacancy in the Supreme Court to take as long as he wants, and he's going to hold up cabinet secretaries and he's targeting eight of them when only just a few short years ago, it was the Democrats that were saying, we needed to move swiftly to approve these cabinet secretaries. Eight cabinet secretaries were approved for President Obama on day one. And now, they turn around and say they're going to drag their feet and put people through the ringer -- I mean, look, it's a frustrating situation. They're very --
(CROSSTALK)
WALLACE: I just want to pick up on that --
PRIEBUS: And I think you're seeing some frustration. That's all.
WALLACE: Reince, I just want to pick up on that -- we got less than a minute left -- because the Office of Government Ethics announced this week that it has been unable to complete background ethics checks on the number of Trump's nominees and said it's a great concern that these confirmation hearings are going to go forward before those background checks are complete. If Senator Schumer says you're trying to jam them through.
Given the statement by the Office of Government Ethics, any thought of delaying the confirmation hearings for any of these nominees until the background checks are complete?
PRIEBUS: No. I mean, they have to get -- they have to get moving. They have to move faster, and they have all the information. These are -- these are people that have been highly successful in their lives.
They need to move quicker. And the fact is, there is no reason. I mean, it's the first week of January. They have all the details that they need. If they have all the information that they need.
It's no different from any other new administration coming in and the American people demanded. Change was voted for and change we will get.
WALLACE: Reince, thank you. Thanks for your time today.
PRIEBUS: You bet.
WALLACE: Just 12 days until the inauguration. Look forward to talking to you again.
PRIEBUS: You bet. Thank you.
WALLACE: Up next, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, Devin Nunes, on U.S. intelligence officially blaming Vladimir Putin for ordering a cyber campaign to influence our presidential election.
WALLACE: A look outside the beltway at the frozen tundra of Lambeau Field in Green Bay, Wisconsin, where the Packers host the New York Giants coincidentally today on FOX.
Now back to our big story. The U.S. intelligence report that Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered a campaign to swing the election in Donald Trump's favor.
Joining me here in Washington, the chair of the House Intelligence Committee, Congressman Devin Nunes of California, who's also a member of the Trump transition.
Congressman, welcome back to FOX NEWS SUNDAY.
REP. DEVIN NUNES (R-CA), HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN: It's great to be here in person.
WALLACE: Before we get to that, let's talk first about the terrible attack in Fort Lauderdale, where five people were killed, six people were wounded. Any evidence this is terror-related?
NUNES: Well, the investigation is ongoing. Clearly, this person walked into the FBI, we know this now, and said that he was watching ISIS videos. It's sometimes I think going to be hard in these situations to know where someone who has mental illness, and also is an ISIS follower, and where that sometimes they can be intertwined. And I think we just have to let the FBI go through this and see if there is any actual data or evidence to show that this was an ISIS follower.
WALLACE: Of course, the big question people have is, how did this happen? And could it happen again, particularly with the guy having walked into the FBI office? Should he have been on a no-fly list? Should he have been allowed to carry a gun, check it in his baggage and take on the flight with him?
NUNES: Well, right, this is -- this is the big challenge that the FBI faces with -- you know, there's investigations going on in all 50 states with ISIS followers and people who are -- who claim they're ISIS followers. And so, some of these cases get close and I think in this case, this one probably shouldn't have been closed.
WALLACE: As chair -- you say it shouldn't have been closed.
NUNES: It shouldn't have been closed.
WALLACE: So, do you think the FBI messed up?
NUNES: Well, look, I think the FBI would tell you that this is -- this is not what the FBI wants. I mean, they do a very good. But they -- obviously, they missed this one.
WALLACE: As chair of House Intelligence, you received the same classified report on Friday. Any doubt in your mind that Russian President Putin directed this attack and at some point -- not originally -- but at some point, it became an effort to stop Clinton and help Trump?
NUNES: So, six months ago, I publicly came out and said that this was the biggest intelligence failure since 9/11, was our failure to understand Putin's plans and intentions.
If you -- so, this has been going on for a long time. We've known that Russia is a very sophisticated bad actor in the cyber realm. Many members of Congress, not just members of the House Intelligence Committee, have been warning the Obama administration about Russia's continued cyber attacks on this country, and they did nothing.
And so, now, as you look forward, you know, they lose an election, and then it appears like they want to change this narrative into somehow that Russia was responsible for Hillary Clinton losing the election. And I just don't buy that.
WALLACE: No, and I want to make this very clear. There's no indication, despite Russia's efforts, and the intelligence community doesn't say this is why Trump won and she lost. But the two things can be true, they try to do a campaign, and Trump won a fair and square election.
I want to go follow up on this policy issue, though, because you say that Mr. Trump has to be tougher than President Obama was in responding to cyber aggression, especially by the Russians, but I want you to respond to this tweet, which I discussed with Reince Priebus. Trump tweeted this on Saturday, ""Having a good relationship with Russia is a good thing, not a bad thing. Only stupid people or fools would think that it is bad.""
This is his first reaction about getting his briefing about Russian interference in the election. It doesn't sound like he's ready to crack down on the Kremlin.
NUNES: And he wouldn't be the first president to want to be buddies with Putin. So, you had President Clinton, President Bush, President Obama, including Secretary Clinton who hit the reset button. Don't forget that you had President Obama, who got caught on a hot mic talking about being more flexible after the election with Vladimir.
So, clearly, three presidents have tried to be friends with Putin. All three have failed, and I hope that Donald Trump, you know, he has a lot more information going into this, and I've cautioned his administration to be careful with Putin, because I think he is a bad actor.
Although it remains true, the fact of the matter is, we would like to be friends with the Russians. I just don't know if it's possible. We've had a lot of experience with Putin. He just doesn't seem to be a guy that we can work with.
WALLACE: I -- as a member, as we said, you're not only head of House Intelligence, you are also a member of the transition team, particularly in these very areas of national security. And I want to ask about the nomination of Senator Dan Coats, to be the director of national intelligence.
Back when Russia invaded Crimea in 2014, Senator Coats said this, ""Does this not remind us of what happened with Hitler in the early `20s and `30s?"" And in response, the Kremlin banned him from traveling to Russia.
So, what does the appointment of a clear hardliner, what does it say about this effort by President-elect Trump and some of his team to try -- or believe they can have better relations with Russia?
NUNES: Well, as I said before, I think all presidents have been making this mistake. But I think you bring up a good point that Dan Coats is Russia hock. Mike Pompeo, the future CIA director, is a Russia hock. General Mattis, who will be secretary of defense, is a Russia hock.
So, Donald Trump is surrounding himself with very good people who understand the threat that Russia poses.
WALLACE: Let me just say, you've also got Rex Tillerson, who has done business with Russia, and received the friend of Russia medal, and you have Lieutenant General Mike Flynn, the national security advisor, who had dinner with Putin. So, I mean -- there's a split inside the administration about Russia.
NUNES: Yes. But like I said, Chris, this is not unusual for administrations to want to work with Putin. I mean, they've tried -- all administrations have tried, going back to the first President Clinton when Putin was first put into office. So, I just don't see where this is anything different, and I think the news media is trying to blow this up -- or I say the Democrats are trying to blow this up, because they're trying to change the narrative of what happened in this election.
You know, I am not happy that this report, that we were briefed on, just the Gang of Eight, was briefed on Friday morning, yet many news media outlets already have the information that was briefed to the Gang of Eight. So, this looks like a political rollout of a narrative just a couple weeks before Donald Trump's inauguration, and it bothers me, and I don't think it's good. And the Intelligence Committee --
WALLACE: Political rollout by the intelligence community or by the Democrats who were briefed?
NUNES: By the Obama administration.
WALLACE: Really?
NUNES: How else --
WALLACE: So, you think this is an effort by the Obama administration to undercut Donald Trump?
NUNES: How else do you define it? How does the news media have this information before it's briefed to the Gang of Eight?
WALLACE: I want to ask you about another question. President-elect Trump talks about tearing up the nuclear deal with Iran. But the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Bob Corker, said this week, you know, leave that alone for a while. There's not going to be a problem. There are sanctions in place against Iran and they have to meet some standards, at least for the next few years. And the key is to focus on the more immediate threat of North Korea.
Your reaction?
NUNES: Well, I think the Iranian regime continues to be one that is the largest funder of terrorism around the globe, and it has to be dealt with swiftly. And I think the Obama administration has been way too nice to the Iranian regime, who essentially are terrorists.
If you look at North Korea, this is one of the situations I think that people are going to look back as one of the major atrocities in world history. And people are going to ask, why did somebody not act? There are -- there are 20 million people living off of eating grass and the roots and trying to burn everything to stay warm in that country.
You look at that country, it's a -- it's one of the worst places I've ever seen and I think it doesn't get enough --
WALLACE: Let -- let me just interrupt because we're beginning to run out of time. After North Korea announced this week that it's in the final stages of developing an ICBM missile that could -- could reach at least part of the United States, Donald Trump sent out this tweet in which he said at the bottom, ""it won't happen."" Now, you talk about other presidents. We've tried direct talks. We've tried pressure on China and it hasn't worked. What is Donald Trump going to do if -- do you have any sense of what he's going to do to try to stop --
NUNES: Well --
WALLACE: North Korea from pursuing its missile --
NUNES: This is another great example of a country, a nation state, that's conducted cyberattacks against the United States, where President Obama did nothing. So, you know, why are we not responding when North Korea attacked this country, attacked Sony, leaked the information. Nothing was done. And so I think what -- I think what Trump is --
WALLACE: Did we not do cyberattacks, because we believe -- that's what we were kind of led to believe, that we took a cyber response.
NUNES: Well, you know, I don't know about that, but I can tell you that this is a regime that has to be taken seriously. We have to be tough with them. And I think Donald Trump will be tough with them.
WALLACE: Quick question, are you talking about military action, take out their nuclear program, take out their missiles?
NUNES: Well, you never take that off the table, but we have a very large force in the region in South Korea protecting the South Koreans. I think Japan and South Korea have to be very concerned about these -- about these ICBMs and their nuclear capability.
WALLACE: Would you urge them to start their own nuclear program?
NUNES: No, I would not. But we have to have a deterrent. And the United States needs to be that deterrent.
WALLACE: Chairman Nunes, thank you. Thanks for coming in today. Always good to talk with you, sir.
NUNES: Great to be here.
WALLACE: Coming up, we'll bring in our Sunday group to discuss whether President Trump can and should still try to establish better relations with the Kremlin.
Plus, what do you want to ask that panel about that terrible attack this week streamed live on FaceBook of four blacks torturing a mentally disabled white man? Just go to FaceBook or Twitter @foxnewssunday, and we may use your question on the air.
WALLACE: Coming up, congressional Republicans much more receptive to those Russian intel findings than the Trump transition team.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
SEN. JOHN MCCAIN (R), ARIZONA: Every American should be alarmed by Russia's attacks on our nation.
SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R), SOUTH CAROLINA: We hope to make 2017 a year of offense.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WALLACE: We'll ask our Sunday panel about the split inside the GOP, next on FOX NEWS SUNDAY.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: What I will say is that -- and I said this right after the election -- we have to reminder ourselves we're on the same team. Vladimir Putin is not on our team.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WALLACE: President Obama giving his successor, Donald Trump, gentle advice about how to deal with the Russian president after the report of Kremlin interference in the U.S. election.
And it's time now for our Sunday group. Laura Ingraham, editor of LifeZette, Fox News political analyst and columnist for ""The Hill,"" Juan Williams, Julie Pace who covers the White House and the transition for the Associated Press, and Michael Needham, head of the conservative think tank Heritage Action for America.
Well, Laura, as I was discussing with Reince Priebus and with Congressman Nunes, there are several things, all of which can be true, that the Russians did try to influence the campaign, that the Democrats are trying to use it to delegitimize Trump, and that Trump won the election fair and square. Where does this go from here and how do you think Donald Trump needs to handle Russia and that whole relationship?
LAURA INGRAHAM, HOST, ""THE LAURA INGRAHAM SHOW"": I think he has to handle it pragmatically as I think he's going to handle the economy, which is, eyes wide open. We've made a lot of mistakes in the past. I think Priebus made the point of our -- our cyber security, both at the DNC and our own government, it's been pathetic. We are way behind the curve on the cybersecurity. I think you're going to hear Donald Trump launched an entirely new initiative that will be very transparent and what the government's going to do to beef it up.
But, look, I lived in the former Soviet Union. I know I -- I've been in Russia like seven times in the past five or six years. It does not surprise me in the least that Russia tried to influence the election. Not in the least. I mean this is what they do. This is what the FSB does, the former KGB. It's what the military intelligence does over there.
We've done the same thing in other countries. It doesn't make it right. It doesn't make it good. But I think what we have to understand at this point is, Donald Trump's going to be the president. The country's either going to improve, get more united behind certain issues or not. And the Democrats can kind of try to hang on to this. I don't know what purpose it's going to serve unless it results in better security for all of our systems across the board.
But this report was five pages long, the declassified report. Byron York (ph) wrote a great piece about this. Lots of questions remain. There are five pages, broadly spaced. We don't know if Russia was trying to undermine Hillary or help Trump. We don't know exactly when the hacking really began or when the influence campaign began. We don't know if it's just garden- variety propaganda.
There are a lot of questions that remain. It doesn't mean it didn't happen. I think it should be taken seriously. But to hyperventilate, that, oh, this means that Trump is going to be, you know, a -- you know, in this palsy- walsy (ph) relationship with Trump -- with Putin, I don't see that. I think that's a fasil (ph) way of looking at this.
WALLACE: Julie, I want to pick up on something that I discussed with Congressman Nunes. This isn't the first president who's come in thinking that he's going to get along and tame the Russian bear. Clinton did it. George w. Bush did it, looking into Putin's eyes. Obama with the reset. What do you think of the chances that they can turn a corner here, or what -- or in the end will it all come to ashes as it did with his predecessors?
JULIE PACE, THE ASSOCIATED PRESS: I think part of the reason you see new president's come in and take this position, that we want to try to start new with Russia, is because I think everyone generally agrees it would be better if the United States and Russia had better relations. There isn't a lot of dispute about that.
The question that I think Trump has to grapple with here is less about what he's going to do to try and reprove relations, and more about what he's going to need Putin to do. We hear a lot about the Obama administration not being tough enough, not acting quickly enough on -- on hacking and cybersecurity. But what are Trump's measures going to be for Putin? What does he have to do vis-.-vis Assad in Syria, what does he need to do in terms of Russians meddling in Ukraine? I think that is going to be the larger question that will shape this relationship.
WALLACE: I want to turn dramatically to a story that everybody was horrified by and talking about this, this week, and that, of course, was the attack. And you see it there on camera four, blacks torturing a mentally disabled white man live on FaceBook, and forcing him to say hateful things. Here he -- here they are.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (EXPLETIVE DELETED) Donald Trump. (EXPLETIVE DELETED) white people, boy.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WALLACE: Juan, I'm -- I was thinking about this yesterday. I'm not sure what to ask you except, how on earth can this happen?
JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS POLITICAL ANALYST: Right. It's just shocking. And it's primitive. It's savage. And, you know, on a very emotional level for me, scares me that people can behave in this manner to each other and then put it on tape for broadcast.
WALLACE: (INAUDIBLE) live.
WILLIAMS: Yes. Well, I mean to --
WALLACE: Yes.
WILLIAMS: What I mean was broadcast it out.
WALLACE: (INAUDIBLE).
WILLIAMS: Right. So I think, to me, it -- it -- it stirs up racial tensions already hot from the campaign rhetoric of Donald Trump about the Mexicans and the women and all the rest. And we live in a society now where immediately the response, the strong response online was to tie this somehow into Black Lives Matter. And you see this from the white nationalists who seem excited by Trump's election, to say, now, this is evidence of black racism, as if that were therefore legitimize acts of white racism.
It just -- it becomes perverse. You know, everything -- conversations about Dylann Roof, about a disabled black kid that was tortured, not on tape or live, as you describe it, so we didn't know about that. But clearly there's something happening in the society that is deeply troubling on the level of race and difference. And the key here is, I think as -- you know, response -- for responsible people, including our president-elect, to act, to speak out and to say very clearly, this is unacceptable.
WALLACE: We asked you for questions for the panel, and we got a lot of responses about this, including this on FaceBook from Roddie Spaniel Shelley. ""Why is it more important to focus on politics in the crime than race? It was a racial hate crime. Say the words. It's finally time to call it what it is.""
Michael, how do you answer Roddie?
MICHAEL NEEDHAM, CEO, HERITAGE ACTION FOR AMERICA: Well, I think this is the problem with hate crimes legislation in the first place. Look, what is problematic in the video that you saw is that it is despicable, and it is torturing of a mentally disabled person. And I think for us, and a lot of what Juan was just saying in terms of talking about the racial aspects of it, we shouldn't have hate crime legislation. We shouldn't be saying that if you torture somebody because of politics or you torture somebody because of race, that's worse that if you torture somebody live on camera because of money or just because you're a sick, depraved individual.
And the additional problem with hate crimes legislation is that you're forcing -- in this case it's very easy. They're saying on tape why they're doing it and what they're believing. But in many of these hate crimes cases, you're actually forcing a jury or a judge to get inside the mind of a depraved killer or torturer. And so I think we should be looking at the crime that was committed. We should be looking at the crime that's committed in all of these hate crimes, so-called hate crimes there have been, and not putting people in jail because of their thoughts, but putting people in jail because of their actions. These were depraved, disgusting actions.
WALLACE: You (INAUDIBLE) that, Juan?
WILLIAMS: You know, I think there's an added element that, you know, when you have people who are taking actions because of your race, religion, faith, ethnicity, immigrant status, whatever. And the whole idea behind hate crime legislation was that it would be additionally punitive. And I think these people should be punished to the absolute fullest extent of the law. But I do think --
NEEDHAM: If somebody had paid money to these guys once --
WILLIAMS: No.
NEEDHAM: So if somebody had just paid money to these guys and said, hey, I think it would be really amusing to have a video on -- on TV about this, that would have been less bad than in this case because that wouldn't have been a hate crime? Look, what you're saying --
WILLIAMS: No, because it's the -- it's the treatment of a -- of a guy who was a friend and who was mentally disabled.
NEEDHAM: Right.
WILLIAMS: And that's the point. But, I mean, when you come to a Dylann Roof killing, was it nine or 10 black people in the church, again, I think your point is, it's the action that counts. But I think when you add the racial element into it, I think it does factor in. It's a legitimate factor.
WALLACE: We have a fact (ph) next segment --
INGRAHAM: Well --
WALLACE: Thirty seconds.
INGRAHAM: Just -- just --
WALLACE: Real quick.
INGRAHAM: I think there's a -- there's a great point to be made about the aggravating factor of -- of the hate crime. But, Juan, in -- in answering the question -- we're all horrified by this. It's evil, depraved (ph). But you mentioned white nationalists excited about Trump and you mentioned Trump's comments about Mexicans. This is just an evil act. I think to throw in Obama -- I -- I would agree with you even. The whole Black Lives Matter conversation, who knows what -- if that might have had an effect on it. But to -- to mention Trump in the -- in the -- in the conversation about what they did, to me just is -- is completely off base.
WILLIAMS: They mentioned -- they mentioned Trump, Laura.
INGRAHAM: Right, they mentioned Trump negatively. You're also mentioning Trump negatively, which is --
WILLIAMS: I don't think there's any question that there's racial tension about the comments that Donald Trump has made in his campaign.
INGRAHAM: That's -- and -- and none of it had -- had -- was affected at all by what Barack Obama has done for false comments.
WALLACE: Look, you're stealing time from yourself in the next segment and we need -- we need to get to it.
INGRAHAM: Hands up, don't shoot.
WALLACE: But you can all continue this conversation during our break. We need to take a break here.
When we come back, our Sunday group gives us their predictions on all sorts of subjects for 2017. You won't want to miss it, I promise you.
WALLACE: Well, we're now going to look at predictions for 2017. And I want to talk with you, Laura, because you had a good 2016 predicting a year ago. Yes.
INGRAHAM: OK, say it, Chris, every single one of my predictions came out --
WALLACE: No, I'm not going to.
INGRAHAM: OK.
WALLACE: But on the economy, you said it was going to bump along. You said that the former Republican president was going to skip the convention. I'm not going to give you high marks for saying UCONN won the women's --
INGRAHAM: OK, not that one, but Hamilton dominating the --
WALLACE: (INAUDIBLE) -- no, that was kind of chalk too.
Anyway, politics, 2017.
INGRAHAM: I think Trump will nominate and the Senate will confirm a justice on the Supreme Court who will go down as a hero to judicial conservatives, constitutionalists. Perhaps Bill Pryor (ph). Perhaps Tom Lee (ph) of the Utah Supreme Court. It's going to be a -- a great justice.
WALLACE: And the Democrats won't be able to block it?
INGRAHAM: No.
WALLACE: All right. Julie?
PACE: Well, I actually made a New Year's resolution to be less predictive about politics. So I told my husband that because predictions did not go so well for a lot of journalists and pundits last year. So at least in keeping in the spirit of my resolution, I am going to predict that it's going to be an incredibly unpredictable year in politics.
WALLACE: That, I predict, will be the worst prediction I hear for 2017.
Michael, do -- help us out here.
NEEDHAM: Yes, most legislation in the last 100 years, the progressive era has been expanded within its first five to 10 years. The media said Republicans were quick -- quicksodic (ph). We were wasting time trying to repeal Obamacare. Obamacare will be repealed. They secretary of Health and Human Services, Tom Price, will do a great job managing the transition. Obamacare will be repealed and the American people will have access to -- to better health care focused on themselves and their doctors.
WALLACE: Juan, your production for politics?
WILLIAMS: That President Obama's phase (ph) in the game, that he becomes a powerbroker inside the Democratic Party in a way that we have not seen former presidents behave in recent history. He has high approval ratings. He's going to live in your neighborhood, Chris, so he's staying in D.C.
WALLACE: Thank you.
WILLIAMS: And the whole issue became one now of legacy. And I think he's going to be very engaged. He's still a young man at 55. So he's going to be very much a player.
WALLACE: Very young. It's a child at 55.
Economy, Laura.
INGRAM: Contrary to all the talk of a trade war under President Trump, we will export more goods and services in 2017 than we did in 2016. We're going to have a vigorous approach to trade, which will be more practical, pragmatic, and it will be better for American manufacturers.
WALLACE: Julie.
PACE: I think we're going to see businesses continue to be eager, in some cases, to let Donald Trump take credit for decisions they're making to either bring jobs back to the U.S. or keep jobs in the U.S. It's a mutually beneficiary relationship for Trump and businesses.
WALLACE: Even if Trump had nothing to do with it?
PACE: Even if Trump had nothing to do with it.
WALLACE: Michael.
NEEDHAM: Laura was right, the 2016 was going to be a sluggish year. 2017's going to turn it around. Tax reform, regulatory relief. We will have the first real GDP growth of 3 percent or more in 2017. In a decade, we'll have productivity gains for the first time since 2014.
WALLACE: Juan.
WILLIAMS: I think Janet Yellen will be out as the chair of the Fed before the end of the year. President-elect Trump said during the campaign that he thinks she's overly political. And that was before she raised the interest rates a quarter point in December. And now we have the stock market pushing up towards 20,000. I think you're going to see some real head-butting over the economy and its future under President-elect Trump.
WALLACE: And, briefly, how will the markets react to Yellen leaving?
WILLIAMS: Not well. That's -- that's a point of anxiety for people who don't like uncertainty.
WALLACE: Sports. And I was going to say, I already know your prediction.
INGRAHAM: (INAUDIBLE) you get the camera, you get on the Alabama pin? UCONN, right, that was kind of obvious. I'm from Connecticut. UCONN last year. But Nick Saban will now go down, I think, in Alabama lure and history as right on par with Bear Bryant. They're going to win tomorrow night against Clemson. They'll have captured their fifth national championship in eight years. And I'm not going to be there. I'm going to be on Tucker Carlson's show tomorrow night. So I'm bummed, though, because I can't -- I'm not -- I'm going to miss part of the game.
WALLACE: Oh, really, you're going to -- you chose television over being at a game? Wow!
INGRAHAM: I have to help Tucker. It's his first show at 9:00. Go Tucker.
WALLACE: Your priorities. Well, that's true, it is his first show and we wish him good luck.
INGRAHAM: Yes.
WALLACE: Julie.
PACE: Well, this is probably more wishful thinking than actual prediction, but I'm going to go for it. My beloved Buffalo Bills will finally end their 17 year playoff drought in 2017.
INGRAHAM: Awe.
WALLACE: Well, that -- that is --
PACE: Wishful thinking.
WALLACE: Hope over experience.
PACE: Wishful thinking.
WALLACE: I love these two, because they're kind of in direct conflict. Michael.
NEEDHAM: As usual, Juan is going to be wrong on his prediction.
WILLIAMS: Wow.
NEEDHAM: Injuries derailed me in 2016. I'm going to stick with it. The best pitching staff that Major League Baseball has seen since the 1990s will propel the New York Mets to win the World Series.
WALLACE: Juan.
WILLIAMS: The Nationals. The Washington Nationals will win the World Series this year. Dusty Baker, the manager who came in 2015, he said his job was to win a World Series. Hasn't done it yet. I think this is the moment they turn the corner because the Mets, Michael, I don't think -- I think they -- they're due date has gone.
WALLACE: Well, we should point out, it's not that one is going to win the World Series. They can't even get to the World Series, one or the other, because they're in the same division.
NEEDHAM: The Mets are going to knock the Nationals off far far before the World Series.
WILLIAMS: Oh, please.
WALLACE: All right. Entertainment.
INGRAHAM: Oh, this is the best. OK.
WALLACE: The envelope, please.
INGRAHAM: Now this is -- once again, a lot of the biggest movies of next year are going to feature characters that were really popular in the late 1970s for 12-year-old, 13-year-old nerdy boys. So we're going to have Wonder Woman. Yes, the new Wonder Woman. How can you ever remake Linda Carter in Wonder Woman. They're going to do ""Planet of the Apes,"" ""Star Wars: Episode VIII."" It is going to be comic book central. And, once again, you know, I'm sorry, but remake-o-rama in Hollywood. Fresh out of ideas.
WALLACE: Were you a -- were you a nerd in the 1970s?
INGRAHAM: I -- no, I didn't like any of those. I'm the -- I was -- I was a drama-comedy.
WALLACE: You didn't like Wonder Woman? I find that surprising.
INGRAHAM: No. Well, not really. I wasn't that. I was like ""Brady Bunch,"" you know, all those kind of shows. But these are going to be huge movies. But the ""Planet of the Apes,"" you can't get better than Roddy McDowell in like 19 -- whatever that was, 70. But they're going to try to do it again, planet -- ""Return of Planet of the Apes.""
WALLACE: Wow. OK.
Julie.
PACE: Before the end of the year, I predict we are going to Donald Trump appearing on ""Saturday Night Live"" without Alec Baldwin.
INGRAHAM: Oooh.
WALLACE: I have to tell you, since I took this show in 2003, because I have to get up early Sunday morning, I have not watched ""Saturday Night Live."" I would stay up to watch Alec Baldwin -- can you imagine the two of them together.
PACE: Really good.
WALLACE: Michael.
NEEDHAM: Yes, more (INAUDIBLE) people on my team couldn't agree whether or not Mariah Carey will have a comeback. So I'll predict Lena Dunham (ph), who promised us she would leave this nation, will not move to Canada, and America will be forced to endure her for another year.
INGRAHAM: Oh.
CAW: I take it we're not a ""Girls"" fan?
INGRAHAM: Oh.
NEEDHAM: We're not a ""Girls"" fan.
INGRAHAM: Gross.
WALLACE: (INAUDIBLE).
INGRAHAM: It's like a gross show. It's disgusting.
WALLACE: OK. All right. Anyway, nevertheless.
Juan.
WILLIAMS: So I see that critics are -- are picking ""Moonlight"" for best picture, but I think it's actually going to be ""Fences"" Denzel Washington and Viola Davis. I think that's a tremendous movie and it's going to get a lot of attention. Also, you know, when it comes to best actress, Natalie Portman in her portrayal of Jackie Kennedy, it's going to stir a lot of nostalgia about Camelot and the Kennedys in this era.
WALLACE: Well, I hate to say this, but just as Michael said you're wrong, it will be ""La La Land,"" which wins best picture. And the Golden Globes are tonight. No, it was good. I'm sorry. Did you see it?
INGRAHAM: I saw it last night. Yes. I mean just save your time and watch ""Singing in the Rain."" People can actually sing and dance.
WALLACE: And Debbie Reynolds is in it.
Panel, we have to take a final break. When we come back, we'll get one more prediction from each of you for 2017.
WALLACE: As we begin the new year, we're asking our panel what they see ahead for 2017. Now time for one final prediction, your pick for the person to watch this year. And as we told them, you cannot pick Donald Trump.
Laura.
INGRAHAM: Jeff Sessions. He'll be confirmed as attorney general of the United States. And --
WALLACE: And why him over the other cabinet picks?
INGRAHAM: Because I think we have so many really, really big issues in criminal justice issues, criminal civil division. He's going to root out, I think, ultimately, the politicization of the DOJ, which has been terrible in recent years. He is a man to watch and he'll be a phenomenal attorney general.
WALLACE: Julie, one to watch for 2017.
PACE: Picking up on one of Juan's predictions, my person to watch as Barack Obama. He's going to be living in Washington. He has talked a lot about appreciating the way that George W. Bush handled his post-presidency, staying quiet, not questioning his decisions. But I think that he's going to face a lot of pressure from Democrats to speak out against Trump.
WALLACE: Michael.
NEEDHAM: Stephen Miller is Donald Trump's senior advisor for policy. He was one of the first people in Washington, D.C. to identify, to understand the forces that really disrupted our politics in 2015/2016. He's going to have a huge impact on policy inside the administration.
WALLACE: Juan.
WILLIAMS: South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg. I always have trouble with his last name. But he is a Harvard grad, Rhodes scholar, Navy officer, served in Afghanistan and I -- President Obama has identified him as one of the parties future stars at a time when the party lacks a strong bench. He's running for Democratic National Committee chair against Keith Ellison, Tom Perez. He offers a different look -- a gay guy from the --
WALLACE: Real quick, yes or no, is he going to -- will he win DNC chair?
WILLIAMS: I don't know the answer to that, Chris.
WALLACE: OK. There we go. That's a definite maybe.
Panel, thank you. We'll lock all these predictions in a vault or maybe we'll just stick them on a shelf somewhere and we'll check back next year to see how you all did.
That's it for today. Have a great week, and we'll see you next FOX NEWS SUNDAY."

The U.S. intelligence community says Vladimir Putin ordered a cyber attack to interfere in our presidential election and help Donald Trump win -- as tension rises between the president-elect and the nation's spy chiefs.
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
JAMES CLAPPER, DIRECTOR OF NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE: I don't think that we've ever encountered a more aggressive or direct campaign to interfere in our election process. 
WALLACE: Today, incoming White House chief of staff Reince Priebus on Mr. Trump's rocky relationship with the intelligence community.
And the president-elect seems to find an ally and the founder of WikiLeaks.
SEN. CLAIRE MCCASKILL (D), MISSOURI: The notion that the elected -- the soon elected leader of this country would put Julian Assange on a pedestal.
WALLACE: We'll ask House Intelligence Committee Chair Devin Nunes about some conservatives embracing Assange and Mr. Trump's plans to overhaul the nation's spy agencies. It's a FOX NEWS SUNDAY exclusive.
Plus, we'll ask our Sunday panel about that horrific attack everyone is talking about -- four blacks torturing a mentally disabled white man live on Facebook.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (EXPLETIVE DELETED) Donald Trump (EXPLETIVE DELETED) white people.
WALLACE: All right now on FOX NEWS SUNDAY.
(END VIDEOTAPE)
WALLACE: And hello again from FOX News in Washington.
Russian President Vladimir Putin wanted to block Hillary Clinton. That's the blunt assessment of U.S. intelligence agencies on the Kremlin's effort to influence the 2016 election in Donald Trump's favor. An unclassified report now released after the nation's spy chiefs briefed Congress, President Obama and President-elect Trump.
In a moment, we'll get the Trump team's reaction from incoming White House chief of staff Reince Priebus.
But first, let's bring in chief intelligence correspondent Catherine Herridge with the latest on what the intel community found -- Catherine.
CATHERINE HERRIDGE, FOX NEWS CHIEF INTELLIGENCE CORRESPONDENT: Chris, the report has strong language, the tone is authoritative and most of the conclusions are at the high confidence level. The central finding is that Russian President Vladimir Putin authorized a campaign to undermine and influence the U.S. democratic process, with the goal of damaging Clinton and her chances of winning. Overtime, the Russians came to favor a Donald Trump victory.
The FBI Director James Comey, CIA Director John Brennan are very confident Putin wanted to help Mr. Trump. While the NSA Director Mike Rogers, whose agency analyzes signals intelligence, including intercepted phone calls, was only moderately confident.
The report says Russian intelligence provided the stolen emails to Julian Assange and his website WikiLeaks. Because of its self-proclaimed reputation for authenticity, Assange has consistently denied the Russian government connection.
Writing in a tweet after his classified briefing, the president-elect said there was absolutely no evidence that hacking affected the election results, voting machines not touched.
Though mentioning Russia, the vice president-elect said the briefing was useful.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
MIKE PENCE (R), VICE PRESIDENT-ELECT: It was a constructive and respectful dialogue. And the president-elect has made it very clear that we're going to take aggressive action in the early days of our new administration, to combat cyber attacks and protect the security of the American people.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
HERRIDGE: Senior congressional leadership known as the ""Gang of Eight"" was briefed but they did not see the underlying raw data -- Chris.
WALLACE: Catherine, I want to also ask you about the latest of that massacre Friday at Ft. Lauderdale Airport. Police say an Iraq war vet, Esteban Santiago, opened fire after retrieving a gun for his checked bag. Any evidence that this is terror-related?
HERRIDGE: Well, Chris, investigators have not ruled out terrorism and confirmed to FOX News that the FBI's main field office in Alaska investigated Santiago in November after he told agents that U.S. intelligence had infiltrated his mind and forced him to watch ISIS propaganda videos. No tie to terrorism was found. Santiago's mental state did not meet the legal standard for authorities to take his gun, and his erratic behavior was simply not enough for the no-fly list. He now faces three federal charges that each carry the possibility of death, Chris.
WALLACE: Catherine, thank you.
HERRIDGE: You're welcome.
WALLACE: One of the people in the room when President-elect Trump was briefed on the Russian campaign to disrupt our election is Reince Priebus, the incoming White House chief of staff.
And, Reince, welcome back to FOX NEWS SUNDAY.
REINCE PRIEBUS, INCOMING WHITE HOUSE CHIEF OF STAFF: Good morning, Chris.
The nation's intel chiefs laid out the full classified report to President- elect Trump and others in his team, including you that Russian president Vladimir Putin ordered a cyber attack to interfere with the election and eventually came to try to help Donald Trump.
Simple question: does the president-elect accept the findings and the evidence of the intelligence community?
PRIEBUS: Well, I think he accepts the findings, Chris. But here's the thing that I think everyone needs to understand -- when this whole thing started, it started from the Russians 50 years ago. In other words, this is something that's been going on in our elections for many, many years, both the Russians, the Chinese, the Iranians. It happens every election period.
Now, in this particular case, it started way back in 2015 before either nominee of either party was chosen, and it started, and this is declassified, as a spear phishing exhibition over many different institutions. It just so happened that the DNC had nearly no defenses on their system, and when they were warned multiple times by the FBI, they didn't respond.
And so, suddenly, you have a major political party, one of the biggest political parties in the world, that by their own admission lacked defenses, lacked training, and allowed a foreign government into their entire email system without responding to the FBI.
So, yes, we have bad actors around the world. We have had bad actors, including the Russians. But we also have a problem when we have a major political institution that allows foreign governments into their system with hardly any defenses or training. That's a huge story, and that's what people aren't talking about as well.
WALLACE: That's a fair point. And it's also, we should point out, there is no evidence that the Russians in any way were able to get into the electoral system and tamper with the vote count.
But on Friday, hours before he had the briefing, Donald Trump said that this was, quote, ""a political witch hunt"".
So, I just want to be very clear on two political points. Does he now accepts -- but you say, well, this has been going on for years, never to this extent, never the hacking and dissemination of emails, and you could argue as to whether they were in some way were complicit in it because of their weaknesses, that we've never had this kind of dissemination before. Does he accept that the Russians were behind this hacking campaign? Yes or no?
PRIEBUS: Well, sure. I mean, he's not denying that entities in Russia were behind this particular campaign. But let me just -- can you -- let me respond to your point, though. You say never have we had such a massive -- yes, but here's what we have. We have the DNC as a sitting duck.
So, if you have a person -- wait a second, because it matters to your point. It matters because if the DNC allows any foreign entity into their system, says, here is 50,000 emails, you can have them. Well, voila! Now, you have the biggest dissemination of emails that we've ever seen in the history of America because we have a revolving door at the DNC.
WALLACE: Who do you blame more for this? Who do you blame more for this, Reince? Do you blame Putin and the Kremlin? Or do you blame the DNC? Who is the primary actor here?
PRIEBUS: Well, listen, the primary actor is the foreign entity that's perpetrating the crime to begin with, no doubt about it.
WALLACE: Which was? Which was?
PRIEBUS: I'm not denying that.
WALLACE: Which was?
PRIEBUS: I'm not denying that. I'm not denying that.
WALLACE: And what was that foreign entity?
PRIEBUS: The thing is -- Russia.
But what I'm telling you is that we also have a situation where you have people at the DNC -- let me ask you this. Anyone listening out there, if you had multiple calls from the FBI and you said, ""By the way, Chris, this is the FBI, I think someone is in your system and stealing all of your emails"", and you ignore multiple, multiple calls.
They attempted to attack the RNC in the same way. They didn't get into our system because number one, we had our head straight and we had defenses at the RNC. But number two, when the FBI called the RNC and said, we've got a hacking situation, we brought them in immediately.
And so, granted we have bad actors around the world, and cyber attacks have been happening for years, but we also have an entity that's allowed through a wide open door a foreign government into their system.
WALLACE: I get that.
One other question.
PRIEBUS: Go ahead.
WALLACE: Does President-elect Trump accept the evidence that he heard, does he find it persuasive, that Putin's interest towards the end of the campaign was to help Trump by discrediting Clinton?
PRIEBUS: I haven't asked him about that, Chris. I mean, he accepts the fact that Russia and other entities engaged in cyber attacks on the United States all day long. He accepts the fact that this particular case was entities in Russia. So, that's not the issue.
But -- and if you look at his statement, after he commends the intelligence community in the very first paragraph, he talks about the particular hack. He talks about the fact that the DNC was a sitting duck while at the RNC had its act together. He then says in the first 90 days of his administration, he is going to order a full report as to what we can do to be better.
But one of the things we can do to be better is when the FBI calls you and says you have a problem, you return the phone call.
WALLACE: Well, I want to ask about that, because he said yesterday in which he said that we want to have better relations with Russia. I mean, if he accepts the fact that they, in an unprecedented way, tried to interfere with our election, does that mean he is not going to respond, he's not going to take action against Russia?
PRIEBUS: He very well, he's going to order the intelligence community to make recommendations, and whatever those recommendations are will be discussed and actions may be taken, but I don't think there's anything wrong with trying to have a good relationship with Russia and other countries around the world. And that's what the president is saying, that he is going to have good relationships around the world that will put America first, bring jobs back and make a safer across the globe. That's what he wants to do and I think that's what he will do.
WALLACE: I want to consider the question of the president-elect's relations, not with Russia, but with the intelligence community. Because here was a tweet that he put out on Tuesday. ""The, quote, 'intelligence' briefly on the so-called, quote, 'Russian hacking' was delayed until Friday. Perhaps more time needed to build a case. Very strange.""
This was the reaction from the director of national intelligence.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
JAMES CLAPPER, DIRECTOR OF NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE: I think there's a difference between the skepticism and disparagement.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WALLACE: Isn't that disparaging when the president-elect of the United States puts the word intelligence in quotes?
PRIEBUS: Well -- and Mr. Clapper also stated that there is no evidence in the report that any of this changed the outcome of the election.
But to your question, here's what happened -- the president of the United States, a week earlier, a few days earlier, took on an enormous and unprecedented sanctions against Russia. We then went into full gear to get an intelligence briefing on what the president knew that created that strong reaction, or what the briefing was that created that is sudden, strong reaction, and we were attempting to have that full-blown meeting on Tuesday.
WALLACE: I'm not asking about the schedule, Reince.
(CROSSTALK)
WALLACE: But wait a minute, I'm asking about why did he put the word intelligence quotes?
PRIEBUS: Because I'm getting to the point.
The reason he put it in quotes is that the intelligence briefing in quotes that we were attempting to have was going to be on Tuesday. It turns out, that the report, which apparently was supposed to be done that created the Obama reaction, wasn't going to be done until Wednesday, and therefore, the intelligence briefing in quotes that we were supposed to have on Tuesday was then, we were informed, was going to be done on Friday.
So, here we are having to react to these Russian sanctions stories with the media and all of you, folks, you -- and you're a good one, Chris. We were supposed to be reacting to something that we had no ability to get a briefing on because the actual report wasn't done until Wednesday. It's a frustrating situation and that's what the president-elect was referring.
WALLACE: Yes, but the question is the way the relationship that he has with the intelligence community, what even the DNI, General Clapper, saw as disparagement.
I want to ask you about something else, because the president-elect this week seemed to put more credibility to believe the founder of WikiLeaks over the intelligence community. And I want to put up another tweet that the president-elect said on Wednesday.
""Julian Assange said a 14-year-old could have hacked Podesta -- why was DNC so careless? Also said the Russians did not give him the info.""
Reince, several years back, I don't have to tell you, Julian Assange published, disclosed, hundreds of thousands of classified cables and other emails and documents that very much compromised the U.S. military in Iraq and that endanger the lives of hundreds of Afghan informants helping the U.S. military.
Why would the president-elect give any credibility to Julian Assange?
PRIEBUS: Well, first of all, to your other point, he has tremendous respect to the people in the intelligence community. In his statement on Friday, it was the very first thing he said, and he wanted to make it clear to everyone working hard in the interest of our foreign intelligence that he appreciates them very much.
As to Assange, he doesn't think this guy is a good guy. He put in quotes things that he had said. He didn't say I support this guy. He didn't say I think he's a good guy.
WALLACE: Why even quote him? Why even give him any credibility? He's the president-elect.
PRIEBUS: I think his point is that -- well, wait a second, I think his point is that the DNC was so lacking in any of their defenses, by their own admission.
WALLACE: OK, we got that. I'm just asking why he was --
PRIEBUS: Perhaps a 14-year-old could have gotten into the -- but perhaps a 14-year-old could have gotten into the DNC. When you have staffers opening up emails that say, you know, ""I'm stranded in Mali and I need $20,000, click on this link"", and the DNC is clicking on these links.
You know, I've got to tell you something, no one thinks that Assange is a great guy, I can assure you of that. But I think the issue here is yes, bad foreign actors, but it's also the DNC that has allowed itself to be hacked by about anyone in the world, and that is one of the reasons why this was such a big deal.
WALLACE: OK.
PRIEBUS: I don't think anybody is talking about it.
WALLACE: I want to get into one must area, we are running out of time. Has President-elect Trump given up on trying to work with Democrats?
PRIEBUS: Absolutely not. Absolutely not. In fact, another meeting --
(CROSSTALK)
WALLACE: Can I explain to why I'm asking the question?
PRIEBUS: Sure.
WALLACE: Because I'm curious as to why he sent out to go tweets this week. One referring to Schumer clowns, and another, the head clown, Chuck Schumer.
Here's what Vice President Biden said this week.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
JOSEPH BIDEN, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Grow up, Donald. Grow up. Time to be an adult. You're president. You've got to do something. Show us what you have.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WALLACE: How do you respond to the vice president and why on earth call Chuck Schumer a clown? How was that going to help you?
PRIEBUS: Well, first of all, Chuck Schumer and President-elect Trump have a long, long relationship together. Donald Trump has helped Chuck Schumer in his runs for Senate. Donald Trump has had massive fundraiser for Chuck Schumer at Mar-a-Lago many times before. They have a personal relationship.
And I've got to tell you -- I mean, when Senator Schumer says that he is going to allow the vacancy in the Supreme Court to take as long as he wants, and he's going to hold up cabinet secretaries and he's targeting eight of them when only just a few short years ago, it was the Democrats that were saying, we needed to move swiftly to approve these cabinet secretaries. Eight cabinet secretaries were approved for President Obama on day one. And now, they turn around and say they're going to drag their feet and put people through the ringer -- I mean, look, it's a frustrating situation. They're very --
(CROSSTALK)
WALLACE: I just want to pick up on that --
PRIEBUS: And I think you're seeing some frustration. That's all.
WALLACE: Reince, I just want to pick up on that -- we got less than a minute left -- because the Office of Government Ethics announced this week that it has been unable to complete background ethics checks on the number of Trump's nominees and said it's a great concern that these confirmation hearings are going to go forward before those background checks are complete. If Senator Schumer says you're trying to jam them through.
Given the statement by the Office of Government Ethics, any thought of delaying the confirmation hearings for any of these nominees until the background checks are complete?
PRIEBUS: No. I mean, they have to get -- they have to get moving. They have to move faster, and they have all the information. These are -- these are people that have been highly successful in their lives.
They need to move quicker. And the fact is, there is no reason. I mean, it's the first week of January. They have all the details that they need. If they have all the information that they need.
It's no different from any other new administration coming in and the American people demanded. Change was voted for and change we will get.
WALLACE: Reince, thank you. Thanks for your time today.
PRIEBUS: You bet.
WALLACE: Just 12 days until the inauguration. Look forward to talking to you again.
PRIEBUS: You bet. Thank you.
WALLACE: Up next, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, Devin Nunes, on U.S. intelligence officially blaming Vladimir Putin for ordering a cyber campaign to influence our presidential election.
WALLACE: A look outside the beltway at the frozen tundra of Lambeau Field in Green Bay, Wisconsin, where the Packers host the New York Giants coincidentally today on FOX.
Now back to our big story. The U.S. intelligence report that Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered a campaign to swing the election in Donald Trump's favor.
Joining me here in Washington, the chair of the House Intelligence Committee, Congressman Devin Nunes of California, who's also a member of the Trump transition.
Congressman, welcome back to FOX NEWS SUNDAY.
REP. DEVIN NUNES (R-CA), HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN: It's great to be here in person.
WALLACE: Before we get to that, let's talk first about the terrible attack in Fort Lauderdale, where five people were killed, six people were wounded. Any evidence this is terror-related?
NUNES: Well, the investigation is ongoing. Clearly, this person walked into the FBI, we know this now, and said that he was watching ISIS videos. It's sometimes I think going to be hard in these situations to know where someone who has mental illness, and also is an ISIS follower, and where that sometimes they can be intertwined. And I think we just have to let the FBI go through this and see if there is any actual data or evidence to show that this was an ISIS follower.
WALLACE: Of course, the big question people have is, how did this happen? And could it happen again, particularly with the guy having walked into the FBI office? Should he have been on a no-fly list? Should he have been allowed to carry a gun, check it in his baggage and take on the flight with him?
NUNES: Well, right, this is -- this is the big challenge that the FBI faces with -- you know, there's investigations going on in all 50 states with ISIS followers and people who are -- who claim they're ISIS followers. And so, some of these cases get close and I think in this case, this one probably shouldn't have been closed.
WALLACE: As chair -- you say it shouldn't have been closed.
NUNES: It shouldn't have been closed.
WALLACE: So, do you think the FBI messed up?
NUNES: Well, look, I think the FBI would tell you that this is -- this is not what the FBI wants. I mean, they do a very good. But they -- obviously, they missed this one.
WALLACE: As chair of House Intelligence, you received the same classified report on Friday. Any doubt in your mind that Russian President Putin directed this attack and at some point -- not originally -- but at some point, it became an effort to stop Clinton and help Trump?
NUNES: So, six months ago, I publicly came out and said that this was the biggest intelligence failure since 9/11, was our failure to understand Putin's plans and intentions.
If you -- so, this has been going on for a long time. We've known that Russia is a very sophisticated bad actor in the cyber realm. Many members of Congress, not just members of the House Intelligence Committee, have been warning the Obama administration about Russia's continued cyber attacks on this country, and they did nothing.
And so, now, as you look forward, you know, they lose an election, and then it appears like they want to change this narrative into somehow that Russia was responsible for Hillary Clinton losing the election. And I just don't buy that.
WALLACE: No, and I want to make this very clear. There's no indication, despite Russia's efforts, and the intelligence community doesn't say this is why Trump won and she lost. But the two things can be true, they try to do a campaign, and Trump won a fair and square election.
I want to go follow up on this policy issue, though, because you say that Mr. Trump has to be tougher than President Obama was in responding to cyber aggression, especially by the Russians, but I want you to respond to this tweet, which I discussed with Reince Priebus. Trump tweeted this on Saturday, ""Having a good relationship with Russia is a good thing, not a bad thing. Only stupid people or fools would think that it is bad.""
This is his first reaction about getting his briefing about Russian interference in the election. It doesn't sound like he's ready to crack down on the Kremlin.
NUNES: And he wouldn't be the first president to want to be buddies with Putin. So, you had President Clinton, President Bush, President Obama, including Secretary Clinton who hit the reset button. Don't forget that you had President Obama, who got caught on a hot mic talking about being more flexible after the election with Vladimir.
So, clearly, three presidents have tried to be friends with Putin. All three have failed, and I hope that Donald Trump, you know, he has a lot more information going into this, and I've cautioned his administration to be careful with Putin, because I think he is a bad actor.
Although it remains true, the fact of the matter is, we would like to be friends with the Russians. I just don't know if it's possible. We've had a lot of experience with Putin. He just doesn't seem to be a guy that we can work with.
WALLACE: I -- as a member, as we said, you're not only head of House Intelligence, you are also a member of the transition team, particularly in these very areas of national security. And I want to ask about the nomination of Senator Dan Coats, to be the director of national intelligence.
Back when Russia invaded Crimea in 2014, Senator Coats said this, ""Does this not remind us of what happened with Hitler in the early '20s and '30s?"" And in response, the Kremlin banned him from traveling to Russia.
So, what does the appointment of a clear hardliner, what does it say about this effort by President-elect Trump and some of his team to try -- or believe they can have better relations with Russia?
NUNES: Well, as I said before, I think all presidents have been making this mistake. But I think you bring up a good point that Dan Coats is Russia hock. Mike Pompeo, the future CIA director, is a Russia hock. General Mattis, who will be secretary of defense, is a Russia hock.
So, Donald Trump is surrounding himself with very good people who understand the threat that Russia poses.
WALLACE: Let me just say, you've also got Rex Tillerson, who has done business with Russia, and received the friend of Russia medal, and you have Lieutenant General Mike Flynn, the national security advisor, who had dinner with Putin. So, I mean -- there's a split inside the administration about Russia.
NUNES: Yes. But like I said, Chris, this is not unusual for administrations to want to work with Putin. I mean, they've tried -- all administrations have tried, going back to the first President Clinton when Putin was first put into office. So, I just don't see where this is anything different, and I think the news media is trying to blow this up -- or I say the Democrats are trying to blow this up, because they're trying to change the narrative of what happened in this election.
You know, I am not happy that this report, that we were briefed on, just the Gang of Eight, was briefed on Friday morning, yet many news media outlets already have the information that was briefed to the Gang of Eight. So, this looks like a political rollout of a narrative just a couple weeks before Donald Trump's inauguration, and it bothers me, and I don't think it's good. And the Intelligence Committee --
WALLACE: Political rollout by the intelligence community or by the Democrats who were briefed?
NUNES: By the Obama administration.
WALLACE: Really?
NUNES: How else --
WALLACE: So, you think this is an effort by the Obama administration to undercut Donald Trump?
NUNES: How else do you define it? How does the news media have this information before it's briefed to the Gang of Eight?
WALLACE: I want to ask you about another question. President-elect Trump talks about tearing up the nuclear deal with Iran. But the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Bob Corker, said this week, you know, leave that alone for a while. There's not going to be a problem. There are sanctions in place against Iran and they have to meet some standards, at least for the next few years. And the key is to focus on the more immediate threat of North Korea.
Your reaction?
NUNES: Well, I think the Iranian regime continues to be one that is the largest funder of terrorism around the globe, and it has to be dealt with swiftly. And I think the Obama administration has been way too nice to the Iranian regime, who essentially are terrorists.
If you look at North Korea, this is one of the situations I think that people are going to look back as one of the major atrocities in world history. And people are going to ask, why did somebody not act? There are -- there are 20 million people living off of eating grass and the roots and trying to burn everything to stay warm in that country.
You look at that country, it's a -- it's one of the worst places I've ever seen and I think it doesn't get enough --
WALLACE: Let -- let me just interrupt because we're beginning to run out of time. After North Korea announced this week that it's in the final stages of developing an ICBM missile that could -- could reach at least part of the United States, Donald Trump sent out this tweet in which he said at the bottom, ""it won't happen."" Now, you talk about other presidents. We've tried direct talks. We've tried pressure on China and it hasn't worked. What is Donald Trump going to do if -- do you have any sense of what he's going to do to try to stop --
NUNES: Well --
WALLACE: North Korea from pursuing its missile --
NUNES: This is another great example of a country, a nation state, that's conducted cyberattacks against the United States, where President Obama did nothing. So, you know, why are we not responding when North Korea attacked this country, attacked Sony, leaked the information. Nothing was done. And so I think what -- I think what Trump is --
WALLACE: Did we not do cyberattacks, because we believe -- that's what we were kind of led to believe, that we took a cyber response.
NUNES: Well, you know, I don't know about that, but I can tell you that this is a regime that has to be taken seriously. We have to be tough with them. And I think Donald Trump will be tough with them.
WALLACE: Quick question, are you talking about military action, take out their nuclear program, take out their missiles?
NUNES: Well, you never take that off the table, but we have a very large force in the region in South Korea protecting the South Koreans. I think Japan and South Korea have to be very concerned about these -- about these ICBMs and their nuclear capability.
WALLACE: Would you urge them to start their own nuclear program?
NUNES: No, I would not. But we have to have a deterrent. And the United States needs to be that deterrent.
WALLACE: Chairman Nunes, thank you. Thanks for coming in today. Always good to talk with you, sir.
NUNES: Great to be here.
WALLACE: Coming up, we'll bring in our Sunday group to discuss whether President Trump can and should still try to establish better relations with the Kremlin.
Plus, what do you want to ask that panel about that terrible attack this week streamed live on FaceBook of four blacks torturing a mentally disabled white man? Just go to FaceBook or Twitter @foxnewssunday, and we may use your question on the air.
WALLACE: Coming up, congressional Republicans much more receptive to those Russian intel findings than the Trump transition team.

SEN. JOHN MCCAIN (R), ARIZONA: Every American should be alarmed by Russia's attacks on our nation.
SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R), SOUTH CAROLINA: We hope to make 2017 a year of offense.

WALLACE: We'll ask our Sunday panel about the split inside the GOP, next on FOX NEWS SUNDAY.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: What I will say is that -- and I said this right after the election -- we have to reminder ourselves we're on the same team. Vladimir Putin is not on our team.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WALLACE: President Obama giving his successor, Donald Trump, gentle advice about how to deal with the Russian president after the report of Kremlin interference in the U.S. election.
And it's time now for our Sunday group. Laura Ingraham, editor of LifeZette, Fox News political analyst and columnist for ""The Hill,"" Juan Williams, Julie Pace who covers the White House and the transition for the Associated Press, and Michael Needham, head of the conservative think tank Heritage Action for America.
Well, Laura, as I was discussing with Reince Priebus and with Congressman Nunes, there are several things, all of which can be true, that the Russians did try to influence the campaign, that the Democrats are trying to use it to delegitimize Trump, and that Trump won the election fair and square. Where does this go from here and how do you think Donald Trump needs to handle Russia and that whole relationship?
LAURA INGRAHAM, HOST, ""THE LAURA INGRAHAM SHOW"": I think he has to handle it pragmatically as I think he's going to handle the economy, which is, eyes wide open. We've made a lot of mistakes in the past. I think Priebus made the point of our -- our cyber security, both at the DNC and our own government, it's been pathetic. We are way behind the curve on the cybersecurity. I think you're going to hear Donald Trump launched an entirely new initiative that will be very transparent and what the government's going to do to beef it up.
But, look, I lived in the former Soviet Union. I know I -- I've been in Russia like seven times in the past five or six years. It does not surprise me in the least that Russia tried to influence the election. Not in the least. I mean this is what they do. This is what the FSB does, the former KGB. It's what the military intelligence does over there.
We've done the same thing in other countries. It doesn't make it right. It doesn't make it good. But I think what we have to understand at this point is, Donald Trump's going to be the president. The country's either going to improve, get more united behind certain issues or not. And the Democrats can kind of try to hang on to this. I don't know what purpose it's going to serve unless it results in better security for all of our systems across the board.
But this report was five pages long, the declassified report. Byron York (ph) wrote a great piece about this. Lots of questions remain. There are five pages, broadly spaced. We don't know if Russia was trying to undermine Hillary or help Trump. We don't know exactly when the hacking really began or when the influence campaign began. We don't know if it's just garden- variety propaganda.
There are a lot of questions that remain. It doesn't mean it didn't happen. I think it should be taken seriously. But to hyperventilate, that, oh, this means that Trump is going to be, you know, a -- you know, in this palsy- walsy (ph) relationship with Trump -- with Putin, I don't see that. I think that's a fasil (ph) way of looking at this.
WALLACE: Julie, I want to pick up on something that I discussed with Congressman Nunes. This isn't the first president who's come in thinking that he's going to get along and tame the Russian bear. Clinton did it. George w. Bush did it, looking into Putin's eyes. Obama with the reset. What do you think of the chances that they can turn a corner here, or what -- or in the end will it all come to ashes as it did with his predecessors?
JULIE PACE, THE ASSOCIATED PRESS: I think part of the reason you see new president's come in and take this position, that we want to try to start new with Russia, is because I think everyone generally agrees it would be better if the United States and Russia had better relations. There isn't a lot of dispute about that.
The question that I think Trump has to grapple with here is less about what he's going to do to try and reprove relations, and more about what he's going to need Putin to do. We hear a lot about the Obama administration not being tough enough, not acting quickly enough on -- on hacking and cybersecurity. But what are Trump's measures going to be for Putin? What does he have to do vis-a-vis Assad in Syria, what does he need to do in terms of Russians meddling in Ukraine? I think that is going to be the larger question that will shape this relationship.
WALLACE: I want to turn dramatically to a story that everybody was horrified by and talking about this, this week, and that, of course, was the attack. And you see it there on camera four, blacks torturing a mentally disabled white man live on FaceBook, and forcing him to say hateful things. Here he -- here they are.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (EXPLETIVE DELETED) Donald Trump. (EXPLETIVE DELETED) white people, boy.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WALLACE: Juan, I'm -- I was thinking about this yesterday. I'm not sure what to ask you except, how on earth can this happen?
JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS POLITICAL ANALYST: Right. It's just shocking. And it's primitive. It's savage. And, you know, on a very emotional level for me, scares me that people can behave in this manner to each other and then put it on tape for broadcast.
WALLACE: (INAUDIBLE) live.
WILLIAMS: Yes. Well, I mean to --
WALLACE: Yes.
WILLIAMS: What I mean was broadcast it out.
WALLACE: (INAUDIBLE).
WILLIAMS: Right. So I think, to me, it -- it -- it stirs up racial tensions already hot from the campaign rhetoric of Donald Trump about the Mexicans and the women and all the rest. And we live in a society now where immediately the response, the strong response online was to tie this somehow into Black Lives Matter. And you see this from the white nationalists who seem excited by Trump's election, to say, now, this is evidence of black racism, as if that were therefore legitimize acts of white racism.
It just -- it becomes perverse. You know, everything -- conversations about Dylann Roof, about a disabled black kid that was tortured, not on tape or live, as you describe it, so we didn't know about that. But clearly there's something happening in the society that is deeply troubling on the level of race and difference. And the key here is, I think as -- you know, response -- for responsible people, including our president-elect, to act, to speak out and to say very clearly, this is unacceptable.
WALLACE: We asked you for questions for the panel, and we got a lot of responses about this, including this on FaceBook from Roddie Spaniel Shelley. ""Why is it more important to focus on politics in the crime than race? It was a racial hate crime. Say the words. It's finally time to call it what it is.""
Michael, how do you answer Roddie?
MICHAEL NEEDHAM, CEO, HERITAGE ACTION FOR AMERICA: Well, I think this is the problem with hate crimes legislation in the first place. Look, what is problematic in the video that you saw is that it is despicable, and it is torturing of a mentally disabled person. And I think for us, and a lot of what Juan was just saying in terms of talking about the racial aspects of it, we shouldn't have hate crime legislation. We shouldn't be saying that if you torture somebody because of politics or you torture somebody because of race, that's worse that if you torture somebody live on camera because of money or just because you're a sick, depraved individual.
And the additional problem with hate crimes legislation is that you're forcing -- in this case it's very easy. They're saying on tape why they're doing it and what they're believing. But in many of these hate crimes cases, you're actually forcing a jury or a judge to get inside the mind of a depraved killer or torturer. And so I think we should be looking at the crime that was committed. We should be looking at the crime that's committed in all of these hate crimes, so-called hate crimes there have been, and not putting people in jail because of their thoughts, but putting people in jail because of their actions. These were depraved, disgusting actions.
WALLACE: You (INAUDIBLE) that, Juan?
WILLIAMS: You know, I think there's an added element that, you know, when you have people who are taking actions because of your race, religion, faith, ethnicity, immigrant status, whatever. And the whole idea behind hate crime legislation was that it would be additionally punitive. And I think these people should be punished to the absolute fullest extent of the law. But I do think --
NEEDHAM: If somebody had paid money to these guys once --
WILLIAMS: No.
NEEDHAM: So if somebody had just paid money to these guys and said, hey, I think it would be really amusing to have a video on -- on TV about this, that would have been less bad than in this case because that wouldn't have been a hate crime? Look, what you're saying --
WILLIAMS: No, because it's the -- it's the treatment of a -- of a guy who was a friend and who was mentally disabled.
NEEDHAM: Right.
WILLIAMS: And that's the point. But, I mean, when you come to a Dylann Roof killing, was it nine or 10 black people in the church, again, I think your point is, it's the action that counts. But I think when you add the racial element into it, I think it does factor in. It's a legitimate factor.
WALLACE: We have a fact (ph) next segment --
INGRAHAM: Well --
WALLACE: Thirty seconds.
INGRAHAM: Just -- just --
WALLACE: Real quick.
INGRAHAM: I think there's a -- there's a great point to be made about the aggravating factor of -- of the hate crime. But, Juan, in -- in answering the question -- we're all horrified by this. It's evil, depraved (ph). But you mentioned white nationalists excited about Trump and you mentioned Trump's comments about Mexicans. This is just an evil act. I think to throw in Obama -- I -- I would agree with you even. The whole Black Lives Matter conversation, who knows what -- if that might have had an effect on it. But to -- to mention Trump in the -- in the -- in the conversation about what they did, to me just is -- is completely off base.
WILLIAMS: They mentioned -- they mentioned Trump, Laura.
INGRAHAM: Right, they mentioned Trump negatively. You're also mentioning Trump negatively, which is --
WILLIAMS: I don't think there's any question that there's racial tension about the comments that Donald Trump has made in his campaign.
INGRAHAM: That's -- and -- and none of it had -- had -- was affected at all by what Barack Obama has done for false comments.
WALLACE: Look, you're stealing time from yourself in the next segment and we need -- we need to get to it.
INGRAHAM: Hands up, don't shoot.
WALLACE: But you can all continue this conversation during our break. We need to take a break here.
When we come back, our Sunday group gives us their predictions on all sorts of subjects for 2017. You won't want to miss it, I promise you.
WALLACE: Well, we're now going to look at predictions for 2017. And I want to talk with you, Laura, because you had a good 2016 predicting a year ago. Yes.
INGRAHAM: OK, say it, Chris, every single one of my predictions came out --
WALLACE: No, I'm not going to.
INGRAHAM: OK.
WALLACE: But on the economy, you said it was going to bump along. You said that the former Republican president was going to skip the convention. I'm not going to give you high marks for saying UCONN won the women's --
INGRAHAM: OK, not that one, but Hamilton dominating the --
WALLACE: (INAUDIBLE) -- no, that was kind of chalk too.
Anyway, politics, 2017.
INGRAHAM: I think Trump will nominate and the Senate will confirm a justice on the Supreme Court who will go down as a hero to judicial conservatives, constitutionalists. Perhaps Bill Pryor (ph). Perhaps Tom Lee (ph) of the Utah Supreme Court. It's going to be a -- a great justice.
WALLACE: And the Democrats won't be able to block it?
INGRAHAM: No.
WALLACE: All right. Julie?
PACE: Well, I actually made a New Year's resolution to be less predictive about politics. So I told my husband that because predictions did not go so well for a lot of journalists and pundits last year. So at least in keeping in the spirit of my resolution, I am going to predict that it's going to be an incredibly unpredictable year in politics.
WALLACE: That, I predict, will be the worst prediction I hear for 2017.
Michael, do -- help us out here.
NEEDHAM: Yes, most legislation in the last 100 years, the progressive era has been expanded within its first five to 10 years. The media said Republicans were quick -- quicksodic (ph). We were wasting time trying to repeal Obamacare. Obamacare will be repealed. They secretary of Health and Human Services, Tom Price, will do a great job managing the transition. Obamacare will be repealed and the American people will have access to -- to better health care focused on themselves and their doctors.
WALLACE: Juan, your production for politics?
WILLIAMS: That President Obama's phase (ph) in the game, that he becomes a powerbroker inside the Democratic Party in a way that we have not seen former presidents behave in recent history. He has high approval ratings. He's going to live in your neighborhood, Chris, so he's staying in D.C.
WALLACE: Thank you.
WILLIAMS: And the whole issue became one now of legacy. And I think he's going to be very engaged. He's still a young man at 55. So he's going to be very much a player.
WALLACE: Very young. It's a child at 55.
Economy, Laura.
INGRAM: Contrary to all the talk of a trade war under President Trump, we will export more goods and services in 2017 than we did in 2016. We're going to have a vigorous approach to trade, which will be more practical, pragmatic, and it will be better for American manufacturers.
WALLACE: Julie.
PACE: I think we're going to see businesses continue to be eager, in some cases, to let Donald Trump take credit for decisions they're making to either bring jobs back to the U.S. or keep jobs in the U.S. It's a mutually beneficiary relationship for Trump and businesses.
WALLACE: Even if Trump had nothing to do with it?
PACE: Even if Trump had nothing to do with it.
WALLACE: Michael.
NEEDHAM: Laura was right, the 2016 was going to be a sluggish year. 2017's going to turn it around. Tax reform, regulatory relief. We will have the first real GDP growth of 3 percent or more in 2017. In a decade, we'll have productivity gains for the first time since 2014.
WALLACE: Juan.
WILLIAMS: I think Janet Yellen will be out as the chair of the Fed before the end of the year. President-elect Trump said during the campaign that he thinks she's overly political. And that was before she raised the interest rates a quarter point in December. And now we have the stock market pushing up towards 20,000. I think you're going to see some real head-butting over the economy and its future under President-elect Trump.
WALLACE: And, briefly, how will the markets react to Yellen leaving?
WILLIAMS: Not well. That's -- that's a point of anxiety for people who don't like uncertainty.
WALLACE: Sports. And I was going to say, I already know your prediction.
INGRAHAM: (INAUDIBLE) you get the camera, you get on the Alabama pin? UCONN, right, that was kind of obvious. I'm from Connecticut. UCONN last year. But Nick Saban will now go down, I think, in Alabama lure and history as right on par with Bear Bryant. They're going to win tomorrow night against Clemson. They'll have captured their fifth national championship in eight years. And I'm not going to be there. I'm going to be on Tucker Carlson's show tomorrow night. So I'm bummed, though, because I can't -- I'm not -- I'm going to miss part of the game.
WALLACE: Oh, really, you're going to -- you chose television over being at a game? Wow!
INGRAHAM: I have to help Tucker. It's his first show at 9:00. Go Tucker.
WALLACE: Your priorities. Well, that's true, it is his first show and we wish him good luck.
INGRAHAM: Yes.
WALLACE: Julie.
PACE: Well, this is probably more wishful thinking than actual prediction, but I'm going to go for it. My beloved Buffalo Bills will finally end their 17 year playoff drought in 2017.
INGRAHAM: Awe.
WALLACE: Well, that -- that is --
PACE: Wishful thinking.
WALLACE: Hope over experience.
PACE: Wishful thinking.
WALLACE: I love these two, because they're kind of in direct conflict. Michael.
NEEDHAM: As usual, Juan is going to be wrong on his prediction.
WILLIAMS: Wow.
NEEDHAM: Injuries derailed me in 2016. I'm going to stick with it. The best pitching staff that Major League Baseball has seen since the 1990s will propel the New York Mets to win the World Series.
WALLACE: Juan.
WILLIAMS: The Nationals. The Washington Nationals will win the World Series this year. Dusty Baker, the manager who came in 2015, he said his job was to win a World Series. Hasn't done it yet. I think this is the moment they turn the corner because the Mets, Michael, I don't think -- I think they -- they're due date has gone.
WALLACE: Well, we should point out, it's not that one is going to win the World Series. They can't even get to the World Series, one or the other, because they're in the same division.
NEEDHAM: The Mets are going to knock the Nationals off far far before the World Series.
WILLIAMS: Oh, please.
WALLACE: All right. Entertainment.
INGRAHAM: Oh, this is the best. OK.
WALLACE: The envelope, please.
INGRAHAM: Now this is -- once again, a lot of the biggest movies of next year are going to feature characters that were really popular in the late 1970s for 12-year-old, 13-year-old nerdy boys. So we're going to have Wonder Woman. Yes, the new Wonder Woman. How can you ever remake Linda Carter in Wonder Woman. They're going to do ""Planet of the Apes,"" ""Star Wars: Episode VIII."" It is going to be comic book central. And, once again, you know, I'm sorry, but remake-o-rama in Hollywood. Fresh out of ideas.
WALLACE: Were you a -- were you a nerd in the 1970s?
INGRAHAM: I -- no, I didn't like any of those. I'm the -- I was -- I was a drama-comedy.
WALLACE: You didn't like Wonder Woman? I find that surprising.
INGRAHAM: No. Well, not really. I wasn't that. I was like ""Brady Bunch,"" you know, all those kind of shows. But these are going to be huge movies. But the ""Planet of the Apes,"" you can't get better than Roddy McDowell in like 19 -- whatever that was, 70. But they're going to try to do it again, planet -- ""Return of Planet of the Apes.""
WALLACE: Wow. OK.
Julie.
PACE: Before the end of the year, I predict we are going to Donald Trump appearing on ""Saturday Night Live"" without Alec Baldwin.
INGRAHAM: Oooh.
WALLACE: I have to tell you, since I took this show in 2003, because I have to get up early Sunday morning, I have not watched ""Saturday Night Live."" I would stay up to watch Alec Baldwin -- can you imagine the two of them together.
PACE: Really good.
WALLACE: Michael.
NEEDHAM: Yes, more (INAUDIBLE) people on my team couldn't agree whether or not Mariah Carey will have a comeback. So I'll predict Lena Dunham (ph), who promised us she would leave this nation, will not move to Canada, and America will be forced to endure her for another year.
INGRAHAM: Oh.
CAW: I take it we're not a ""Girls"" fan?
INGRAHAM: Oh.
NEEDHAM: We're not a ""Girls"" fan.
INGRAHAM: Gross.
WALLACE: (INAUDIBLE).
INGRAHAM: It's like a gross show. It's disgusting.
WALLACE: OK. All right. Anyway, nevertheless.
Juan.
WILLIAMS: So I see that critics are -- are picking ""Moonlight"" for best picture, but I think it's actually going to be ""Fences"" Denzel Washington and Viola Davis. I think that's a tremendous movie and it's going to get a lot of attention. Also, you know, when it comes to best actress, Natalie Portman in her portrayal of Jackie Kennedy, it's going to stir a lot of nostalgia about Camelot and the Kennedys in this era.
WALLACE: Well, I hate to say this, but just as Michael said you're wrong, it will be ""La La Land,"" which wins best picture. And the Golden Globes are tonight. No, it was good. I'm sorry. Did you see it?
INGRAHAM: I saw it last night. Yes. I mean just save your time and watch ""Singing in the Rain."" People can actually sing and dance.
WALLACE: And Debbie Reynolds is in it.
Panel, we have to take a final break. When we come back, we'll get one more prediction from each of you for 2017.
WALLACE: As we begin the new year, we're asking our panel what they see ahead for 2017. Now time for one final prediction, your pick for the person to watch this year. And as we told them, you cannot pick Donald Trump.
Laura.
INGRAHAM: Jeff Sessions. He'll be confirmed as attorney general of the United States. And --
WALLACE: And why him over the other cabinet picks?
INGRAHAM: Because I think we have so many really, really big issues in criminal justice issues, criminal civil division. He's going to root out, I think, ultimately, the politicization of the DOJ, which has been terrible in recent years. He is a man to watch and he'll be a phenomenal attorney general.
WALLACE: Julie, one to watch for 2017.
PACE: Picking up on one of Juan's predictions, my person to watch as Barack Obama. He's going to be living in Washington. He has talked a lot about appreciating the way that George W. Bush handled his post-presidency, staying quiet, not questioning his decisions. But I think that he's going to face a lot of pressure from Democrats to speak out against Trump.
WALLACE: Michael.
NEEDHAM: Stephen Miller is Donald Trump's senior advisor for policy. He was one of the first people in Washington, D.C. to identify, to understand the forces that really disrupted our politics in 2015/2016. He's going to have a huge impact on policy inside the administration.
WALLACE: Juan.
WILLIAMS: South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg. I always have trouble with his last name. But he is a Harvard grad, Rhodes scholar, Navy officer, served in Afghanistan and I -- President Obama has identified him as one of the parties future stars at a time when the party lacks a strong bench. He's running for Democratic National Committee chair against Keith Ellison, Tom Perez. He offers a different look -- a gay guy from the --
WALLACE: Real quick, yes or no, is he going to -- will he win DNC chair?
WILLIAMS: I don't know the answer to that, Chris.
WALLACE: OK. There we go. That's a definite maybe.
Panel, thank you. We'll lock all these predictions in a vault or maybe we'll just stick them on a shelf somewhere and we'll check back next year to see how you all did.
That's it for today. Have a great week, and we'll see you next FOX NEWS SUNDAY."

AL SHARPTON, MSNBC HOST: Good morning! I`m Al Sharpton, and you`re watching POLITICS NATION. 
Senator Bernie Sanders has called on the president-elect to keep his campaign promises. Trump repeatedly promised not to cut Medicare, Medicaid, or social security.
Senator Sanders joins me now from Burlington, Vermont. Thank you for being with us this morning, Senator.
SANDERS: My pleasure.
SHARPTON: You have called on Donald Trump to do what Donald Trump said he was going to do. Do you think he is going to yield to your reminding him of what he said? Or do you think that the change is already in motion?
SANDERS: Well, Al, I know it is a radical idea to demand that a candidate actually keep his word. I do know that that is a radical approach. But what the heck, you know. And what`s important here to understand is Trump didn`t just say this in passing. It wasn`t in one interview.
What he was telling the American people, working people, elderly people, hey, I am a different type of Republican. And he mentioned people like Paul Ryan by name. He said Ryan and these other guys want to cut your social security, your Medicare, your Medicaid. Not me! Not me! I`m not going to do it.
So, yes, we are going to hold Trump accountable. In fact, on Tuesday, I have an amendment up supported by I believe all Democrats, which says just that. We say to our Republican colleagues, hey, stand by your leader. Keep faith with the American people. He said you`re not going to cut social security, Medicare and Medicaid. Let`s vote to support Donald Trump`s effort not to cut these vitally important programs.
SHARPTON: And one of the things that I think a lot of the public does not really understand, because a lot of times we talk in beltway talk or pundit talk, is that this seriously impacts people. I mean, if you put Medicare and privatize it in any way, shape or form, or block grants with Medicaid or privatize or go back to states deciding in terms of affordable health care, we`re talking about millions of seniors, millions of people that don`t have means that will effectively be at risk in terms of their own health needs.
SANDERS: Al, you`re too kind when you say ""at risk."" There are studies out there, and common sense tells us this. If the Republicans do what they want to do -- this is not Trump, this is the Republican leadership in the Congress -- end the Affordable Care Act, throw 20 million people off of the health insurance they have right now, throw 20 million people off of the health insurance, thousands of people are going to die! That`s what we`re talking about.
Thousands of people who are sick will not be able to go to a doctor, will not be able to go to the hospital. These guys have no alternative plan. They just want to eliminate the Affordable Care Act, 20 million people off of health insurance they currently have.
Furthermore, as you know, people like Paul Ryan, they want to end Medicare as we know it.
SHARPTON: Right.
SANDERS: They want to voucherize it. That means you`re an 80-year-old person diagnosed with cancer. Here is your $8,000 check, and you go out and find private insurance. Now you tell me what kind of private insurance somebody`s going to find who has cancer who`s 80 years of age.
SHARPTON: None!
SANDERS: Nothing. Nothing.
SHARPTON: Let me ask you this, though. Let`s look at the reality of the landscape. This week we are watching as the countdown toward the Trump inauguration. Given the numbers, the Republicans dominate the Senate and the House, what can Democrats do? Because everywhere I travel, Senator, people are saying the Democrats are not showing any backbone. You`re one of the few even standing up fighting.
I mean, what can be done in a parliamentary way and what could be done from a bully pulpit way to resist this stuff?
SANDERS: Well, we have got to do everything that we can to resist these horrific nominations that Trump has brought forth. I mean, they are the worst. They`re almost unimaginable, the kind of people he`s bringing forth. You`ve got a guy who`s proposing to head the EPA who does not believe in environmental protection, et cetera, et cetera.
SHARPTON: Right.
SANDERS: This is what I am trying to do, is among many other things, I am trying to revitalize the Democratic Party and get this party to be a party that doesn`t simply go out to wealthy people`s homes raising money but becomes a grassroots party. And that`s why I`m supporting Keith Ellison to be the new chair of the Democratic Party.
The good news for us, Al, is on issue after issue, whether it is raising the minimum wage, whether it is pay equity, whether it is climate change, whether it is moving toward health care for all, the American people support a progressive agenda, not giving tax breaks to billionaires and cutting social security, Medicare and Medicaid.
So, on next Sunday, next Sunday, we are going to be holding rallies all across this country for the first time. Democratic Senators are going to be out in a coordinated way. Members of the House are going to be out with the unions, with senior groups, with Planned Parenthood, because they want to defund Planned Parenthood. We are going to bring people together. We`re going to get people calling up, e-mailing Senators and members of Congress and tell them, no, you are not going to cut social security, Medicare and Medicaid, and give tax breaks to billionaires.
SHARPTON: I`m going to get back to you on that, but let me push you a little on, since you brought up Keith Ellison, and we`re going to talk with him. We`re going to talk with Tom Perez.
If Keith Ellison wins or if you succeed in helping to bring the Democratic Party more grassroots, will Bernie Sanders then become a member of the Democratic Party and be a Democrat in the U.S. Senate?
SANDERS: Well, I am an independent who is caucus with the Democrats for 25 years. In Vermont, we don`t have party registration.
SHARPTON: Right.
SANDERS: But let me also tell you something, Democrats are going to have to reach out to the many, many millions of people who are independents today. A lot of people, Al, are not enthusiastic about the Democratic Party and the Republican Party. Too many of them are voting Republican.
SHARPTON: So it would remain independent with many people and you would remain as an independent in the Senate?
SANDERS: Well, right now I was elected for this term as an independent and completing my turn. And I certainly will stay independent completing this term. We`ll cross the next bridge when we come to it.
SHARPTON: Now, when we talk about the Democratic Party reaching out and doing more, we`re talking about reaching out but not abandoning those that have reached out to it. Because a lot of people are saying, well, wait a minute, they`re talking about reaching out to people, but what about those that were there and that were loyal? Does that mean getting off of issues of African-Americans and Latinos and women?
SANDERS: No, no, no, no, no! It means more diversity, bringing more African-American leadership, more Latino leadership into the Democratic Party, more women into the Democratic Party. We need more, not less.
But what we have also got to do is talk about fundamental economic issues. It is not acceptable that the top 0.1 percent owns as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent. That is an issue that impacts everybody. We`ve got to rebuild our infrastructure, create millions of jobs. We`ve got to make college -- we`ve got to make public colleges and universities tuition-free. That`s a black issue, it`s a white issue, it`s a Latino issue, it`s a Native American, Asian-American issue. It impacts everybody.
So, Al, there is -- and I know, I`ve been criticized for this, and it hurts me and I don`t like it. We need not less diversity. We need more diversity. But we`ve got to bring our people together, all of our people, to say that we`re going to create a damn government that represents all of us and not just the one percent. And that`s how I believe we do it.
SHARPTON: Now, you mentioned the mobilization around the country on the 15th. This coming weekend is Martin Luther King weekend. But you know there`s a big national march that we`re involved in with other leading civil rights groups with you supporting, I believe Nina Turner`s coming to speak.
SANDERS: Absolutely.
SHARPTON: You`ll be in Atlanta speaking. So, the 14th is the March on Washington. The 15th, all of us are saying let`s organize locally. So I want to clear that up. There`s no conflict. It`s complementary.
SANDERS: No conflict. We`re working together on this.
SHARPTON: Right.
SANDERS: You`re doing a march on Washington. We`re doing it locally around the country. We`re in this thing together. We don`t have time for conflict. We`ve got to rally the American people. We`re going to stand up and fight back in a way that we have never fought back before against this Trump administration and the Republican agenda.
SHARPTON: And nothing could be more appropriate than next weekend, which is the Martin Luther King holiday weekend, we`re kicking off that Saturday. That Monday`s the official holiday. You marched with Dr. King in your youth. I became a youth organizer many years later in his last months of his life.
So, the King movement is something that`s not politics to us. This is about our way of life and the policies that in many ways mirrors a young teenager, you as a student, geared toward the King movement even at different stages in our lives. And this is what`s at stake, are many of the things that Dr. King represented that some are going to be paying lip service to next week but are going against the very policies that made Martin Luther King Martin Luther King.
SANDERS: You`re absolutely right. And I am honored to be speaking as part of the MLK Day in Atlanta with the King family, and I`ve been very honored to be invited to be there.
But the other point that I would make, Al, is you know, obviously, that when Dr. King was assassinated, he was in Memphis, Tennessee, standing up for some of the most exploited workers in the country. These were garbage workers in Memphis.
SHARPTON: Right.
SANDERS: And in the last months of his life, what he was working on was a poor people`s march on Washington of blacks and whites and Native Americans and Latinos.
SHARPTON: Yes.
SANDERS: To demand a change in national priorities, rather than giving tax breaks to billionaires or spending money on the military, the war at that time, in Vietnam. He wanted to reinvest in America to improve the standard of living of the poor and working people. That`s where he was.
SHARPTON: His last book, ""Where do we go from here,"" that`s what he outlined. And that`s where I don`t know why people are acting like they`re not clear on what his economic policies are.
SANDERS: Well, you know why, Al. You know why and I know why, because it`s politically safe to say, oh, King was a great leader and he got the Voting Rights Act and he did away with segregation in the south. But it`s a little bit harder to say that Dr. King also focused on income and wealth inequality, on the need to make sure that people had decent wages, that he was anti-war. That`s a little bit harder for people to talk about.
SHARPTON: Let me ask you this before I let you go. We keep hearing people say, well, there`s not a real good bench. We don`t see a lot of people on the bench to run in 2020. But I`m saying that I`ve never seen anybody more robust and energetic than Bernie Sanders. Are you ruling out running in 2020?
SANDERS: Al, I think -- look, I`m not ruling out anything, but I think it`s premature to be talking about four years from now. Right now --
SHARPTON: But you`re not ruling it out?
SANDERS: No, I`m not ruling it out.
SHARPTON: That`s what I want --
SANDERS: But we`ve got a struggle, Al, as you well know, and we`ve got to roll up our --
SHARPTON: I just want to know. Inquiring minds want to know. I had to ask. Senator Bernie Sanders, thank you for your time this morning.
SANDERS: OK.
SHARPTON: And again, we`re all together next weekend in the spirit of Dr. King. Thank you.
SANDERS: Thank you, Al.
SHARPTON: Senator Jeff Sessions wants to become the attorney general. One of his fellow Senators says no. Sherrod Brown is next.
SHARPTON: Senator Jeff Sessions has been meeting with lawmakers this week ahead of his confirmation hearing to be the next attorney general. One Senator decided not to support Sessions after meeting with him on Wednesday.
He joins me now. Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio. Welcome to POLITICS NATION again, Senator.
SEN. SHERROD BROWN (D), OHIO: Good to be back. Thanks, Reverend Sharpton.
SHARPTON: Now, Senator Brown, you met with the attorney general nominee Sessions. First of all, what was your impressions? And tell us a little about the meeting.
BROWN: Yes, I met with Senator Sessions on Wednesday. He asked to meet with me. I`ve worked with him on a couple of trade issues, a set of issues I actually agree with him on -- opposition to trans-pacific partnership, renegotiating initiation of the North American free trade agreement -- but he`s not nominated for the U.S. trade rep job. He`s nominated for attorney general.
So I met with him on Wednesday. Spent probably 45 minutes with him, asked him a series of questions about voting rights, about what he would do on issues like hate crimes and issues like the consent decree, which is the relationship with the justice department and city government, police- community relations. Talked to him about a host of those issues.
Most importantly, I want to know what he`s going to do on voting rights, and I`m very concerned with the court decision on Shelby County coming out of Alabama. I am very concerned about the scaling back and rolling back of voting rights in my state, in the south, in Wisconsin, and that`s what ultimately led me to tell him the next day in person -- I believe you do that face-to-face -- that I was not able to vote for him, that I would be voting no on his confirmation.
SHARPTON: You told him face-to-face. Now, I want our viewers to understand, you and he were colleagues. It is very rare for Senators who served with each other not to support him or her if they`re nominated to another position. But you told him because of his stance on voting rights and his stance in issues like consent decree and all that you could not vote for him. That`s a courageous step.
But tell me why you think those are disqualifiers for him being attorney general.
BROWN: Yes, I don`t know if it`s courageous. I mean, there`s this thing around the Senate called Senatorial courtesy, and people think that means if a Senator wants something, is nominated, you kind of automatically vote for him. I don`t really buy that. It`s never personal.
I told Senator Sessions -- and I call him Jeff -- I told him my opposition, my voting against you whenever this vote comes up in the next two or three weeks is of course not personal. It`s about his positions. It`s not even about the past as much as what I think the future will be. And I know he will be criticized for his past statements and record. That`s fine.
But for me, it`s what he`s going to do in the future. I was secretary of state in Ohio, as you know, Reverend Sharpton, for eight years, and I know what you do to expand the right to vote. We had a golden week in Ohio where for a week you could both register and vote for that period where the early voting overlapped with the registration deadline.
We had all kinds of different ways to register people to vote. In fact, I got the McDonald`s corporation to print one million tray liners. So if you ate at McDonald`s during about a one-month period, you could sign up and register to vote on your tray liner, on your placemat, and send it into the board of elections.
We did things like that to open the system. Clearly, Senator Sessions, and perhaps future attorney general Sessions, doesn`t believe in that kind of voter outreach and doesn`t believe in an open registration system, and I`m very concerned.
As soon as the court made that decision, Shelby County, that state after state after state, especially in the south, but as you know, not only in the south, began to restrict the right to vote, and that`s stuff from the 1960s. That`s not -- now, almost immediately. Within days, I believe the first state acted. And that`s just outrageous. I mean, that`s just not what we are as a nation.
And perhaps Donald Trump believes that, that the right to vote should be restricted from some of his comments, but I don`t want the head of the Department of Justice, the most important lawyer of the country, I don`t want him or her -- him in this case -- to be that person with those values.
SHARPTON: You know, when you think about this coming weekend is Martin Luther King day weekend, next Monday`s the holiday, big march in Washington on Saturday, around voting rights and criminal justice, to think that Senator Sessions, who`s from Selma, Alabama, where Dr. King led the famous march that led to the Voting Rights Act, would sit and say that he would not support the, and protect as attorney general these voting rights matters that clearly have expanded and made the rights more available to everyone, is really something that a lot of us going to King Day weekend are wondering whether or not what Dr. King stood for is at risk here.
BROWN: Yes, you look at the progress from the `60s, from voting rights and civil rights in `63 and `64, and the progress we made as a nation, and then `65, and where we`ve gone. And to begin, to roll this back like we saw in state after state this year. I was one of the two leaders of a delegation of about 90 members of Congress to mark the 50th anniversary of Selma.
Senator Scott of South Carolina, Republican, and I led a delegation of I believe 95 House and Senate members to join the president in Selma back in March of this past year, marking the 50th anniversary. Or two years ago, a year and a half ago, I guess.
SHARPTON: Yes, 2013.
BROWN: Yes. And to think of what happened there, and Jimmy Lee Jackson and all the people dying and John Lewis walking across the bridge, and we`re about to have an attorney general from that state -- and again, it`s not personal -- but attorney general from that state who opposes those efforts just breaks my heart.
Now, how do you vote to confirm somebody that`s going to take us back on voting rights?
SHARPTON: Does this lay a challenge to others of your colleagues in the Senate, Democratic and Republican, that they will have to deal with and explain how they could vote for someone who`s taking these positions?
BROWN: Well, I think that`s going to be a question. I had a long conversation with Cory Booker yesterday about this, and he`s clearly going to -- I mean, I`m not speaking for him, but he`s going to be very involved in this.
I don`t -- I just want to say to colleagues that, you know, Senatorial courtesy, because our nominee is a Senator and kind of a friend for a lot of people -- many of us have worked with him. I don`t agree with Jeff Sessions on much. I said I agree with him on trade issues mostly and we`ve worked on some trade enforcement actions together.
But you don`t vote for somebody just because he`s a Senate colleague and you have something called Senatorial courtesy. You vote based on, not even entirely his past, you vote on his future and what an attorney general for the next four years is going to do.
And I want somebody that wants to expand -- it`s pretty simple to me -- you want somebody who is going to expand voting rights, not restrict and restrict and restrict, as we`ve seen coming out of that Shelby County court case and then all of these ultra-conservative state legislatures, that for political reasons in many case are restricting the vote because they know that it`s mostly going to affect young people, older people, people of color, lower income people. That`s who was always blocked out.
I testified in northern district court when I was secretary of state in the 1980s in Oxford, Mississippi, on behalf of the NAACP with them as a secretary of state to expand voting rights. My mother grew up in Georgia. I know the history, not as well as you do, Reverend Sharpton, not as well as John Lewis or real pioneers, but I`ve watched it, I`ve seen it, I`ve seen it up close, and it`s clear to me that expanding voting rights is the key.
SHARPTON: You would think that Senator Sessions would have known it coming, being born in Selma. But I`m glad to see on this morning that Senatorial courtesy does not Trump constituency accountability in your case, and hopefully, others. And I use the term Trump it with pun intended.
Thank you for being with us this morning, Senator Sherrod Brown.
BROWN: Of course you do. Thank you, Reverend Sharpton. Good morning, thank you.
SHARPTON: Coming up, my interview with the man who wants to be the next leader of the Democratic Party, Labor Secretary Tom Perez is up next.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY), MARORITY LEADER: Apparently, there`s yet a new standard now, which is to not confirm a Supreme Court nominee at all. I think that`s something the American people simply will not tolerate, and we`ll be looking forward to receiving a Supreme Court nomination and moving forward on it.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
SHARPTON: Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is sounding absolutely appalled at the notion that Democrats would block a nominee for the vacancy on the Supreme Court, which is interesting, considering he wrote the playbook on how to do it, because the very same day that Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia died, Mitch McConnell was already vowing to make sure his seat stayed empty.
Only an hour after Scalia`s death, McConnell issued a statement saying, ""The American people should have a voice in the selection of their next supreme court justice. Therefore, this vacancy should not be filled until we have a new president.""
The American people spoke on who they wanted to fill that Supreme Court vacancy when they re-elected President Obama in 2012. But instead, McConnell and the republican leaders in the senate kept President Obama`s nominee, Merrick Garland, waiting in limbo for 293 days. It was so long that Garland made history for waiting the longest of any nominee for confirmation to the Supreme Court.
In the end, McConnell`s gamble paid off. Merrick Garland will not become a Supreme Court justice. And now democrats are betting on the same strategy to play defense on that Scotus seat. So, sorry, Mitch, but you can`t change the game when the rules don`t work in your favor. Nice try, but we got you.
SHARPTON: The Democratic National Committee will choose a new chairman next month. The leading contenders for the job are Minnesota Congressman Keith Ellison and Labor Secretary Tom Perez. The honorable Tom Perez joins me now from Washington. Good morning.
TOM PEREZ, SECRETARY OF LABOR: Good morning, Reverend. It`s great to be with you in my personal capacity.
SHARPTON: Thank you. Now, let me ask you, we`ve known you when you were in the justice department leading civil rights, we`ve known you as President Obama`s secretary of labor. Why do you want to be the head of the democratic national committee, Tom?
PEREZ: You know, Reverend Sharpton, this is one of those where are you moments in our nation`s history. We`re at a fork in the road. This is -- with Donald Trump about to take the White House, this is a battle for the heart and soul of our nation, who we are as a nation.
I`ve been a fighter for progressive values my entire life, and after this election, after the shock wore off, I asked myself, how can I make a difference? That`s been a question that`s animated my entire adult professional life. How do I make a difference in the lives of folks who are the underdogs living in the shadows?
And I think that the head of the Democratic National Committee has never been more important than it is right now. We need someone who can inspire people. We need someone who can speak to every stakeholder in the party. We need someone who can take the fight to Donald Trump and we need someone --
SHARPTON: Let me press you right there.
PEREZ: Sure.
SHARPTON: Because you say that it`s an important position, but many people feel the Democratic Party`s no longer important, that we fell short in the campaign, that we didn`t reach a lot of the people, we abandoned some of the base. How are you going to make the Democratic Party relevant to democrats again?
PEREZ: Absolutely, by getting back to basics. My roots are in local organizing. We`ve got to organize and organize and organize, Reverend Sharpton. We overlook that. Organizing is not going to a church every fourth October and saying vote for me. We`ve got to build a 50-state strategy, plus the territories, plus the District of Columbia. We`ve got to invest in the long haul.
I want the Democratic Party to be the party of ideas, the party of innovation, the best organizers in the country. I want them to be coming to the Democratic Party. I want every state to have that ability to recruit candidates so that we can make sure that this party is not a party of the east coast and the west coast, it`s a party everywhere. That`s what we have to do.
SHARPTON: You know, when I look, Tom, at the election results from the general election, and I see, I believe less than 15,000 votes could have moved Michigan another way.
PEREZ: Right.
SHARPTON: I mean, that should be embarrassing to the Democratic Party. That if you`ve got a city like Detroit and you couldn`t come up with another 15,000 votes, and it goes on and on and on. It was some of these key electoral votes -- now, Mrs. Clinton got 2.8 million more of the popular vote than Trump, but in some of the electoral states, it was a matter of lack of connection and organization. I mean, what`s wrong with the party?
PEREZ: Absolutely. Well, we need a party that`s robust in all 50 states. We need to invest. When I first got in this race, my first conversation was with the state party chairs, because I firmly believe that we succeed only insofar as we build a strong party in every state. And by building a strong party, I mean we have to be well-organized. We have to do persuasion.
I`m a big believer in data analytics, but there`s no substitute for persuasion, getting out there, going to that kitchen table, understanding what keeps people up at night, making sure that we have good organizers who are listening, making sure that the Democratic Party is at front and center in protecting the right to vote. And you and I have talked about this many times.
In many states these efforts at voter suppression -- we don`t have a director of voter empowerment at the DNC, and if I have the privilege of being elected, we will have one, because --
SHARPTON: We don`t have a director of voter empowerment at the DNC?
PEREZ: That is correct.
SHARPTON: In the middle of this fight around voting rights?
PEREZ: That is correct, and that`s why we have to change this, and I know we can. We need to make sure that we`re out there doing the persuasion, whether it was Detroit or whether it`s rural America. There`s a county -- Howard County, Iowa, where Obama -- President Obama won by over 20 points and Donald Trump won by 20 points.
And so, we`ve got to understand that voter. How do they vote for Barack Obama and then vote for Donald Trump? We`ve got to communicate that message. And I think it`s a universal and optimistic message of inclusion and opportunity. And that`s what my life has been --
SHARPTON: Inclusion without abandonment, though. Because a lot of people, when we hear them say they we want to reach out -- and I get it -- to Joe the Plumber that you can`t take for granted the base that you`re leaving. And I think that that`s important. I need to ask you this before I run out of time.
PEREZ: Sure.
SHARPTON: How do you look at the proposed new secretary of labor that has been nominated by president-elect Trump? His pick is Andy Puzder, who`s the CEO of Hardee`s and Carl`s Jr., who even said one time that he likes automated workers. They don`t file discrimination suits. I mean, we`re talking about this guy being secretary of labor.
I mean, you`re not here in your capacity as secretary of labor, but as a DNC candidate, DNC chair candidate, how do you look at a guy like this becoming secretary of labor, Tom?
PEREZ: Donald Trump talked about I`m going to lift your wages, I`m going to raise your living standards. You know, the nominee for labor secretary is a plaintiff in the suit challenging our overtime rule.
I believe that the minimum wage in this country needs to be $15 and we need to raise it. And, you know, in states and local governments that have done it, they`ve moved forward. He`s an opponent of raising the minimum wage.
And so, when Donald Trump is speaking to people through his nominations, he`s saying something totally different than what he said on the campaign trail, because we need to be lifting wages and having people across government who understand that we`ve got to help empower workers. We can`t turn back the clock on civil rights at the justice department.
We can`t turn back the clock on labor rights at the labor department. We can`t turn back the clock on protecting our environment. We`ve got to move forward. And whether you live in Detroit, Michigan, whether you live in Ferguson, whether you live in rural Iowa, what I have been about all my life is opportunity, lifting you up. And that is what I hope to do if I have the privilege of being elected to DNC chair.
I`ve been fighter all my life and I hope to take this fight to the Democratic Party and making sure that we can build a party that works for every person in every zip code.
SHARPTON: Well, a fight is what they need to do, and they need to get off the mat first before they fight.
The honorable Tom Perez. Thank you for your time this morning.
PEREZ: It`s a pleasure to be with you.
SHARPTON: Up next, a tale of two speeches -- President Obama`s farewell address and Donald Trump`s first post-election news conference. I`ll discuss both with my panel when we come back.
SHARPTON: President Obama will give his farewell speech on Tuesday in Chicago. The president has a lot to be proud of. The economy added 156,000 jobs in December, making it the 75th consecutive month of job growth, the longest streak ever. The day after president Obama`s farewell address, president-elect Trump says he will give his first news conference since the election.
Well joining me now is Karine Jean-Pierre, national spokesperson for MoveOn.org, and Susan Del Percio, republican strategist.
Susan, will Donald Trump hold a press conference?
SUSAN DEL PERCIO, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST: Very good question.
SHARPTON: And then what will he say? I mean, he hasn`t had a press conference for a while. He certainly has to deal with the Russian hack issue and his alleged connections or lack of, I`m sure he will say, to Russia and his kind of, what is it, bromance that many of us feel he has with Putin.
But he also has to deal with what the president says on Tuesday in his farewell address, and he`s going to have to deal with any number of issues, including defending some of his nominees -- Sessions and others.
DEL PERCIO: Well, like you said, we`ll first see if he actually has one. I do believe he will have one before he is president of the United States on January 21st. But that being said, I don`t think he`s going to attack those issues the way you just proposed them. I think really what he`s going to use this as a means to show his business involvement, what he`s going to kind of divest his interests from. Obviously, we`re not going it see tax returns, but I think he`s going to use this to explain to the American public where he is.
What I also hope he is, is gracious to the current president, just enough - - you know, you don`t have to agree with President Obama on the issues, but he was there for eight years, he`s leaving, and the president-elect just should be a little gracious going into, again, trying to build some goodwill, because this is still a very divided country.
SHARPTON: But, Karine, you know, gracious to the president, the outgoing president, who`s leaving him a sound economy.
KARINE JEAN-PIERRE, NATIONAL SPOKESPERSON, MOVEON.ORG: Exactly.
SHARPTON: An economy with job growth, an economy that clearly, he saved the auto industry and other things. I was at his farewell party the other night and he would not tell any of us what he`s going to say in his farewell address, but I`m sure he will be outlining a lot of the things that he achieved.
Do you think that the nation will have, in watching his farewell address in Chicago, where he came from as a community organizer to the president of the United States -- do you think Americans even in this divided atmosphere will see it as a moment of pride to see what could happen in this country and what this president did for the country?
JEAN-PIERRE: I think that`s exactly right. I mean, President Obama is also one of the greatest orators of our time when you look at the president. And yes, he`ll be going back exactly where he started.
And so, I expect him to talk about, you know, saving the country from the great -- from the brink of -- pulling us back from the brink of great depression, putting millions of people on health care, saving the auto industry. And I think he`ll look back and talk about that a bit.
But also, we have to remember, he did this under unprecedented opposition from the Republican Party and without any real scandal. So, the president has a lot to be proud of. We have a lot to be proud of. And I think he`ll lay that out and he might make some subtle digs on Trump, but I think it will be much more about where the country is now and where he`s taken it in the last eight years.
DEL PERCIO: Yes. But where people support him, they will certainly I think share that point of view. But at the same time, he`s leaving the presidency without a democratic president, without a democratic house, without a democratic senate, losing ten statehouses since he came in, gubernatorial houses, losing over 900 state legislators. So there is a lot of work to be done. And that`s not to take away the fact that he is entitled to this speech and he should say whatever he wants to.
SHARPTON: But those are party concerns. I don`t know that they`re national concerns. And I think you`re right, the party has a lot to answer --
DEL PERCIO: But there is a national concern. I think we could probably all agree --
SHARPTON: But his concern, though, Karine, is that with all you and I and others may feel that was great that the president achieved and could have done a lot more, had he not faced this wall of obstruction that started the night of his inauguration.
JEAN-PIERRE: Right, when they -- in D.C., yes.
SHARPTON: It is true, Susan`s point, that they`re turning over the country to a republican senate, congress, and a president who`s appointed nominees who are vowing to try and erase everything President Obama did, from the Affordable Care Act to voting rights or the fight against voter suppression.
I mean, we are seeing a total repudiation of most of the things President Obama did by an incoming administration that has power.
JEAN-PIERRE: Yes, I totally agree. You just laid it out very well. I just want to touch on one thing. The speech, the farewell speech that he`s making, most all presidents have done it, except for I believe like George Bush Sr. It goes back --
SHARPTON: George Washington.
JEAN-PIERRE: It goes back to George Washington.
DEL PERCIO: I think he should do it. I think it`s an important speech to me.
JEAN-PIERRE: I just want to make sure he is allowed to have this speech and he should have this speech.
DEL PERCIO: Of course.
JEAN-PIERRE: I just want to put that out there. But look, I don`t think the president going to go away after January 20th. I think he will be very vocal. He`s talked about wanting to really focus on redistricting in 2020. We`ve talked about how that`s really important in building the party and as a national party issue, as you were mentioning, Susan.
So, he will be vocal, especially as we`re talking about republicans who want to repeal -- or reputing everything that he`s done. And so, I think that`s going to be really important to see what the president`s going to do.
SHARPTON: No, he`s not going away, Susan, as my mother used to like to say -- I don`t know that he`ll use the line, but every good-bye ain`t gone. I think that he will be saying farewell, but it doesn`t mean bye-bye. I think he`ll still be very much a presence.
DEL PERCIO: Absolutely, but I think he will step aside for six months to a year, maybe use that time as a way to organize and decide really what issues he wants to tackle.
But I think he will give some room to the incoming president. And I wouldn`t be surprised if he does that. And he shouldn`t go on the attack right away. He should step back. He should connect with a really -- he needs to reach out to a lot of people across this country to come back with an agenda that`s worth fighting for.
JEAN-PIERRE: I think if you`re talking about taking health care away from millions of people, deporting millions of people, he`s going to have to defend --
DEL PERCIO: Yes, but he can`t look like --
(CROSSTALK)
SHARPTON: Well, if he does it, many of us will be defending the people that were impacted by it.
JEAN-PIERRE: He`s not going to sit back.
SHARPTON: I heard you say, Susan, Wednesday morning`s press conference by Mr. Trump, if he has it that he should be gracious.
DEL PERCIO: He should be.
SHARPTON: It`s refreshing to see a word of faith on Sunday morning. Thank you both, though, for being with me, Karine Jean-Pierre and Susan Del Percio.
Up next, how you can help protect Dr. Martin Luther King`s Dream.
SHARPTON: I grew up in the Martin Luther King movement. When I was 12, I joined his New York chapter. When I was 13, he was killed. And I have been committed to that cause ever since.
Sometimes my elders had to slap me in to say that`s not King-like, but what never changed was his fight around voting rights, his fight around criminal justice reform, his fight around economic fairness.
That`s why to do what Dr. King wanted done, to celebrate his day, do something King-like. Thousands of us will be in Washington on that Saturday to kick off that weekend at 9:00 at the King monument, the monument that sits there to remind us about a dream of an America that will work for everyone, and a man that gave his life for that dream.
Be active. Do something King-like Saturday. Meet us in Washington. And then on Sunday, as Senator Sanders said on this show, organize locally -- not around party politics, not around our divisions, but around the principles that King stood for, which would save the soul of this country.
That does it for me. Thanks for watching. I`ll see you back here next Sunday.
THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED."
0	5	 6 von 72	Fox News Network	January 7, 2017 Saturday	 THE FIRST 100 DAYS	 7:00 PM EST		"MARTHA MACCALLUM, FOX NEWS HOST: President Donald Trump barrelled through the work day at breakneck pace, pushing forward the forever embattled and delayed to Keystone and Dakota pipelines and working deals with the car folks.
I'm Martha MacCallum and it is day five of ""The First 100.""
So, while all of that was happening at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, Democrats dug in their heels and grilled his nominees. Here is day five.
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) 
DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: This is with regard to the construction of the Keystone pipeline. We will see if we can get that pipeline built. A lot of 28,000 jobs.
From now on, we're going to start making pipelines in the United States. We have a very big push on to have oil plants and other plants built in the United States. We are bringing manufacturing back to the United States big league.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I have behind me two pictures that were taken at about the same time of day in 2009 and 2017, which crowd is larger? The 2009 crowd or the 2017 crowd?
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'm not really sure how the size, though, I'd be happy to answer your question.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Just to give you a context for the obstruction, foot dragging that Democrats are imposing upon this new president, at this point, and President Obama's administration, there were 14 cabinet members confirmed.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'm serious when I say that I'm worried about what my colleagues in the minority side are doing to the Senate as an institution.
(END VIDEOTAPE)
MACCALLUM: So late this evening, the U.S. Senate, after early consternation, voted overwhelmingly to confirm Nikki Haley to become the next U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. In fact, they voted her 96-4. So she makes number four.
President Obama was way ahead of that with his cabinet at this point. Powerful line up for you tonight. In moments, we're going to be joined by Omarosa Manigault, who is in her new office now at the White House. Then, to weigh in on all of this Mark Thiessen, Austan Goolsbee and Charlie Hurt.
But, first, Trace Gallagher on the president's push to build some long- delayed oil pipelines.
Trace?
TRACE GALLAGHER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Martha, this is all part of President Trump's end run around what he calls the U.S. government's, quote, ""Incredibly cumbersome, long, horrible permitting process."" So not only will these executive orders revive the controversial Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipeline projects. They are also meant to fast-track construction by streamlining the environmental review and permitting process.
The Keystone Pipeline would run from Canada to Nebraska and then, connect to existing lines that lead to U.S. refineries on the Gulf Coast. The Canadian-based company building Keystone is already on board, saying, quote, ""We appreciate the president of the United States inviting us to reapply for KXL. We are currently preparing the application and intend to do so.""
But the president's executive orders will not stop the environmentalists from protesting or filing lawsuits to stop the projects, which they have vowed to do.
Today, the Sierra Club blasted what it called Trump's dangerous decision. And in North Dakota, the Standing Rock Sioux tribe say they will also continue their fight against the Dakota Access Line because they say it threatens drinking water and runs under sacred land. Dakota access will carry oil to a shipping point in Illinois.
Remember, the reason President Obama nix the pipelines in 2015 is because he wanted America to lead the fight against climate change and felt building pipelines would not have been putting our money where our mouth is.
The new administration clearly has a different take. Watch.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
SEAN SPICER, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: The president's actions today will create tens of thousands of new jobs for the American workers and move us greater towards energy independence, while at the same time, ensuring that we keep the environment as a top priority.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
GALLAGHER: President Trump also signed an executive order compelling the pipeline companies to use U.S. steel to build the lines. The Canadian builder had said it would use about 65 percent of its steel from the U.S., the rest from Canada. Unclear if that will be renegotiated.
Martha?
Here with more, Mark Thiessen, ""Fox News"" contributor and American Enterprise Institute Scholar. Austan Goolsbee is a professor at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business and a former advisor to President Obama. And Charles Hurt is opinion editor for ""The Washington Times.""
Gentleman, great to have you with us at the top of the show tonight.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Good to be with you.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Good to be with you.
MACCALLUM: Austan, let me start with you. You heard Sean Spicer. He said we're going to build the pipeline and we're going to do it environmentally responsibly. And then you heard the other news that we are going to try to push for more U.S. steel to be part of this negotiation and that's going to create jobs.
So, I guess, the question is, what took so long and why didn't your administration do this much sooner?
AUSTAN GOOLSBEE, FORMER ADVISER TO FORMER PRES. BARACK OBAMA: Well, first, I don't take a numerical estimate from Sean Spicer very seriously. I think he just established that we should not take the numbers.
(CROSSTALK)
MACCALLUM: We're going to get to that in a moment so go ahead.
GOOLSBEE: He quoted tens of thousands of jobs. And I am simply not going to comment on any number that he gives us. I think that Donald Trump is going to overturn this. It was expected. I'm not surprised. I think the fact that Donald Trump is doing this one day after announcing that he wants to renegotiate NAFTA, not apparently being clear on the point that NAFTA is what gives the United States the privileged, the access to the Canadian oil to begin with. So they are definitely not going to start building a pipeline from Canada to the U.S. until we're clear on that.
(CROSSTALK)
MACCALLUM: You don't think Canada is going to turn around and say, forget it, we're not going to do this. Canada wants to do this. This is in Canada's best interest.
(CROSSTALK)
GOOLSBEE: Canada wants to build the pipeline?
(CROSSTALK)
MACCALLUM: Mark, do you want to weigh in?
(CROSSTALK)
MARK THIESSEN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Yes, absolutely. So I know that Austan doesn't want -- I know Austan doesn't want to take Sean Spicer's numbers. But maybe he will take the Obama State Department's numbers.
The Obama State Department did a massive environmental study of this, of the Keystone XL pipeline. They concluded that it would add 42,000 jobs and add $3.6 billion to the economy and blocking the Keystone XL pipeline would have almost no impact on climate change because the oil is going to get to market anyway. And if you don't build the Keystone XL pipeline, they're going to do it by rail and by truck, which will actually increase emissions.
Again, this is the Obama State Department, would increase emissions by 42 percent because all those diesel spewing trucks and railcars are going to deliver the oil anyway.
So the Keystone XL pipeline actually reduces emissions, creates jobs, and adds billions of dollars to the economy. This is a two minute decision and the first minute is for coffee. It took for Obama eight years to say no. Donald Trump did it in his first couple days in all of this so good for him.
(CROSSTALK)
MACCALLUM: All right. I want to get to a bunch of this because it was a very busy day. So let me push you forward to the infrastructure question.
Here's a back and forth with Senator Charles Schumer on The Hill today.
Let's watch.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
SEN. CHARLES SCHUMER (D), NEW YORK: We have heard President Trump's talk of disaster and third world infrastructure. And we call on the president to persuade his Republican colleagues in the House and Senate to drop their opposition to investing in infrastructure and get on board with this plan.
MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY), SENATE MAJORITY LEADER: I don't think we ought to borrow almost a trillion dollars and plus up a bunch of federal accounts, incur a lot of additional debt, and don't build any projects to speak of. So, I can tell you what will happen again is a replication of the Obama stimulus package in 2009.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
MACCALLUM: So, tonight, the Kansas City star, Charlie, is reporting that there is -- the Trump team has are compiled a list of 50 infrastructure projects nationwide, totalling about $137.5 billion as they tried to push this through via a 50/50 public, private partnership on these projects. And, you know, to Mitch McConnell's point, we have heard about shovel-ready jobs before. So what would be different this time?
CHARLIE HURT, OPINION EDITOR, THE WASHINGTON TIMES: Well, this is where it's going to be very difficult for Republicans on Capitol Hill, because of course, they are not going to want to go along with something that has a big price tag on it. But it's also where Donald Trump sees an opportunity to work with Democrats, as much as, you know, equally, as he will with Republicans.
And the thing about that, Martha, is that, that not only in his mind can he get a lot of things done that he wants to get done, by doing it, but it incredibly increases his power.
Because if he establishes those relationships with Democrats on The Hill, without the help from Republicans, then, you know, that just -- all that means is that he's got all that much more support on certain things and it gives him a lot of chips and an ability to sort of negotiate on other things. And so while, you know, Democrats may be sort of gleeful at this split between Republicans, at the end of the day, that is going to strengthen Donald Trump's hand.
One other thing that I think is important to keep in mind, though, is that, you know, this is a guy who is used to building. He builds buildings. He has his entire life. He loves real estate. He loves big projects. And I think he views this as like the biggest Trump Tower ever built. And he doesn't waste money.
He doesn't -- he likes to do these things. He likes to do them efficiently. And he likes to get a lot of pop for his money. And so I don't think it is going to be -- you know, even if I don't like the idea of spending myself, I don't think it's going to be, you know, flushing money down the toilet on things like Solyndra and big waste of money like that.
MACCALLUM: I want to get to one more and I've got about a minute and a half left.
But let's play Sean Spicer today and we'll let Austan chime in on the numbers here. Let's play that.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Does the president believe that millions voted illegally in this election?
SEAN SPICER, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: The president does believe that. He stated that before. I think he stated his concerns of voter fraud and people voting illegally during the campaign and he continues to maintain that belief.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Has the White House formally asks for a probe into this alleged voter fraud?
SPICER: He won very handily with 306 electoral votes, 33 states. He's very comfortable with his win.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
MACCALLUM: All right, I want you all to weigh in on this. He believes it because he believes it.
Austan?
GOOLSBEE: OK. Look, nobody could have said it better than that. He believes it because he believes it. There is evidence, I believe, that two people voted illegally and they were both voting for Donald Trump. There is no evidence that 3 to 5 million people voted illegally. It's really conspiratorial and insane.
MACCALLUM: Mark?
THIESSEN: I think the Trump administration is getting its sea legs. They are stepping on their own story. So why are we wasting time talking about phantom voters who voted illegally. What we should be talking about the fact that he is announcing the Keystone XL Pipeline. That he is announcing the Dakota Pipeline?
The other day, he went to the CIA, rapprochement with the CIA, talking -- you know, trying to build that relationship. Again, they were talking about the crowd size.
This administration has to get the message discipline going because they are doing good things, but they are stepping on out their own stories.
MACCALLUM: All right. We're going to talk about this more with somebody from the White House communications department coming up.
Thank you, guys.
Good to see you.
So coming up, some media outlets claimed that the mood inside President Trump's White House is turbulent and rife with internal power struggles.
Ed Henry separates fact from fiction on that one.
And then, Omarosa Manigault, an assistant to the president, joins us to react.
Plus, growing outrage over the story of a gold star family member who was attacked by protesters when she tried to attend the ball in honor of veterans. We got to hear that story, when Ryan Manion, whose brother was a hero for this country, joins us later tonight.
MACCALLUM: Less than a week in. Some media reports are painting a picture of a white house full of tension and internal power struggles like a drama.
We're going to get first-hand reaction from Omarosa Manigault, an assistant to President Trump. But, first, we go to chief national correspondent Ed Henry joining us from Washington tonight.
Ed?
ED HENRY, FOX NEWS CHIEF WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Martha, good to see you.
A senior Trump advisor, tonight, is telling everyone should calm down. A lot of this is being cooked up by the media, this so dissention. And this advisor wants to focus on all of the executive actions President Trump has taken in recent days.
But the problem is some of the president's other top advisors seem to be more than happy to spill negative details about one another to media outlets like ""The Washington Post,"" which they publish a front-page story with juicy nuggets alleging the president's son-in-law Jared Kushner is so eager to solidify his role as top dog, he's elbowing out others and tried unsuccessfully to block Kellyanne Conway from getting a top job within the White House.
Others whispering that Press Secretary Sean Spicer has been on thin ice with the president in part because Mr. Trump doesn't like the ill-fitting grey pinstripe suit that Spicer was Saturday and that he was musing the confidant that he should put on a darker suit.
Sure enough, in the last few days, the press secretary has been donning, yes, darker suits and doing better at the podium. ""The Post"" also threw in speculation that Conway, who is the president's first choice for press secretary, but turned it down, is now trying to undermine Spicer. People inside say that's not true and today on ""Fox & Friends,"" Conway actually praised Spicer repeatedly.
Meanwhile, ""Politico"" is reporting the president has a shadow cabinet of top aides who are camping out at federal agencies. Critics say these are where our White House loyalists pass was reporting back to Jared Kushner and could undermine the authority of the actual cabinet secretaries.
But White House insiders tell me, tonight, these aids are really just meant to bring some discipline over these cabinet departments and their vast budgets which really fit right into the president's message and his vow of bringing accountability to these massive federal agencies and how they spend our viewer's taxpayer money.
Martha?
MACCALLUM: Very interesting. So, thank you, Ed.
HENRY: Good to see you.
MACCALLUM: Here now with some inside perspective in the halls of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue is Omarosa Manigault. She is an assistant to President Trump and director communications for the office of public liaison.
Omarosa, good to see you tonight. Thank you for being with us.
OMAROSA MANIGAULT, ASSISTANT TO PRES. DONALD TRUMP: Hi, Martha.
MACCALLUM: So you heard that report and you saw the stories this morning, I'm sure. And in some of those stories it says, you know, that they are based on dozens of sources within the White House, who are saying that there is quite a bit of tension between the Kushner camp and the Spicer camp and Kellyanne.
What do you think?
MANIGAULT: Well, I think these stories are very ridiculous. I have to tell you that the people who are close to this president have no problem going on record and talking about how efficient, how clear and concise this operation is.
And I find it very interesting that these stories quote these sources who will not speak up because they are not in the room. It's fabricated, it's drama and it is not happening in this White House.
MACCALLUM: And is there a shadow cabinet that exists, where there are people who are placed at agencies to report back to Jared Kushner, as was reported in that story?
MANIGAULT: That is absolutely not true. I will tell you that this president has run very large, successful organizations. And one thing that distinguishes him as a leader is that he knows how to get the best out of organizations and out of individuals. And he connects with people. And that is exactly what this president is going to do.
On a different level than other presidents have never done. He is someone who knows that in order to make sure that an operation is going smoothly, you have to know what's happening at all levels, but to call it a shadow cabinet is ridiculous.
MACCALLUM: So when we look at the news conferences and we see Sean Spicer at the podium, we also see a whole bunch of other people in the room. You were in the room, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, Kellyanne Conway, all lined up on the side of that room.
When Josh Earnest was doing the job, we didn't see that level. You know, senior advisors to the president sitting there.
Why is that? Why are you guys all in there?
MANIGAULT: Well, let's be very clear. This White House is going to operate in a way that no other White House has. I'm in the room and I can only speak for myself because civil rights is a priority for this president.
What's happening in the inner cities is a priority for this president. The coalitions that I work with, they are priorities for this president.
So, yes, I'm going to be in the room. I want to hear the questions of the press has. I want to make sure that the messaging that we are developing collectively as a team, we are there in the room to support. We are not there to spy in any way, to let Sean do his thing, but to America knows that this president cares about each and everyone of them.
MACCALLUM: All right. You know, you all witness in that news conference the questions about the 3 to 5 million undocumented voters in this country, who Donald Trump believes threw the popular vote for him.
You have known him for a long time. And I was listening to Charles Krauthammer a moment ago saying that he sees it as a character flaw. That he feels that Donald Trump, cannot -- the president cannot sort of sit on it when he has the impulse to just speak out about something like that and then it dominates the news cycle and gets everybody talking about it as we are now.
MANIGAULT: I think that Charles calling it a character flaw means that he knows nothing about this president. I mean, Mr. Trump has his very strong views -- this president had very strong views on what has happened and what he's observed. And he's been getting information that makes him believe that and sees that.
But I have to tell you that this president won with 306 electoral votes. And he --
(CROSSTALK)
MACCALLUM: But there is no documentation to back up that contention about e to 5 million voters who voted illegally. I mean, everybody would be happy to dig into that. It sounds like, you know, obviously, it's a serious charge.
(CROSSTALK)
MANIGAULT: Back in the press briefing, and I heard questioning after questioning about this. And I think Sean addressed this best. It's best that we recognize, one, he is the president. He won handily. And we're going to move on and focus on what Americans care about. That's jobs. That's filling up their gas tanks and filling up prescriptions. They are not focused on what the media is --
(CROSSTALK)
MACCALLUM: No, but he was focused on it in the meeting, in the bipartisan meeting. And that's why we are talking about it, because he brought it up. So I'm asking, you know, do you think that there will be more disciplined going forward on that front, because it does throw off and step on the message that you all are trying to put out there?
MANIGAULT: With all due respect, this is our second day here. And I think that this president has accomplished more in two days that most presidents have in a very long time.
MACCALLUM: Maybe you are right about that.
MANIGAULT: And so, I'm very proud to say that this administration, where Americans are first. What's happening in their homes and their communities are first. And we have seen that. What he's accomplished in just two days. Let's celebrate that and focus on that and not try to look at what's happened in the past.
MACCALLUM: All right. Omarosa, thank you very much. You are absolutely right. And we have detailed all of the action that has been going on over the course of these first few days and it has been at a breakneck pace as we've said.
MANIGAULT: And there is more to come. There is more to come.
MACCALLUM: All right. We'll look forward to reporting on it. Thank you very much. Good to have you here tonight.
MANIGAULT: Thank you, Martha.
MACCALLUM: So coming up, Palestinian claims that one of President Trump's campaign promises could to start a war in the Middle East. We're going to explain that just ahead.
Plus, a new media conflict to investigate. Does President Trump's inaugural phrase ""American carnage"" deserve the ridicule that it has received from some of the media so far? Or does it deserve praise for pointing out some of the issues in this country? Dana Loesch and Richard Fowler up next on that.
MACCALLUM: Breaking tonight, the debate over one of President Trump's most potent inaugural speech moments when he spoke about the, quote, ""American carnage"" that he plans to stop. Watch.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Mothers and children trapped in poverty in our inner cities, rusted out factories scattered like tombstones across the landscape of our nation. An education system flushed with cash, but which leaves our young and beautiful students deprived of all knowledge.
And the crime and the games and the drugs that have stolen too many lives and robbed our country of so much unrealized potential. This American carnage stops right here and stops right now.
(APPLAUSE)
(END VIDEO CLIP)
MACCALLUM: It was a much talked about moment and the larger media pounced at what they called the, quote, ""darkness"" of that phrase.
But did President Trump have a point?
Trace Gallagher live in Los Angeles.
Hi, Trace.
GALLAGHER: Martha, ""The New York Times"" began its article on Trump's inaugural speech by comparing it to other presidents, saying, quoting, ""Abraham Lincoln appealed to our better natures and our charity in the midst of civil of war. John Kennedy inspired us to serve our nations. Donald Trump gave us American carnage.""
And listen to two of MSNBC's hosts.
Watch.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
RACHEL MADDOW, MSNBC HOST: Now, as of today, American carnage will be forever known as the theme for the inaugural address of the 45th president of United States.
UNIDENTIFIED MSNBC MALE HOST: The Trump TV series has a title, ""American Carnage"".""
(END VIDEO CLIP)
GALLAGHER: Then, there is an article from the online magazine ""Slate"" titled the meaning of American carnage, where the author writes, quote, ""There is a small problem with this image. It's fantasy.""
But critics say drawing a fantasy conclusion fails to consider the numbers so we checked. It turns out there is no shortage of carnage like the murder rate, which the FBI says in the first half of last year was up more than 5 percent from the previous year. And has risen significantly over the past two years.
The overall U.S. murder rate isn't as high today as it was in the 1970s and '80s, but in some big cities it's worse. Chicago's 2016 homicide rate was up 59 percent from 2015. Memphis saw a 56 percent increase. And cities like San Antonio, Louisville and Phoenix were also up dramatically.
All told, the number of Americans murdered last year could fill a sports arena. But the number of Americans who died from drug overdose could fill a stadium.
In fact, the U.S. drug overdose rate in 2015 was more than triple the murder rate. So, while many critics accuse the president of using his speech to generate fear, others say the numbers themselves are pretty scary.
Martha?
MACCALLUM: Thank you, Trace.
So joining me now, Dana Loesch, host of ""Dana,"" on The Blaze TV and Richard Fowler, a ""Fox News"" contributor, nationally syndicated radio talk show host.
Good to have both of you with us tonight.
RICHARD FOWLER, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Good to be here, Martha.
DANA LOESCH, HOST, DANA: Thanks, Martha.
(CROSSTALK)
MACCALLUM: You know, you look at those numbers and you think about the people who have been affected by them, in cities like San Antonio and Chicago and Memphis, where they are in many neighborhoods, living in a perilous situation and are afraid to go out at night, Richard.
So what is wrong with recognizing the pain that those people are feeling?
FOWLER: I don't think there is anything wrong with recognizing the pain. I think the job of inaugural dresses, which we have seen in the past, is to inspire Americans to do more. I mean George W. Bush did in his speech, Ronald Reagan, these idea that we are aspiring to be this great nation. I think where Donald Trump missed the mark on his speech, that it was overall a good campaign speech, but it missed the mark when it comes to defining what makes America great again is. When you think about the word carnage, which according to web, it means the killing of mass people, I don't really know if carnage is the right vocabulary word I would use if I was the Donald.
MACCALLUM: I wonder if you were a family who had lost a child to heroin overdose or if you lived in a community where you can't go outside at night, because of the violence that is happening in your streets, Dana, I think there are plenty of people in this country who might feel comforted, that instead of platitudes on that stage that day, they heard what they understand as they are reality and something that they want fixed.
LOESCH: Martha, what you just said there, right in that sentence, is exactly why Trump won on November 8th. People are tired of platitudes. They are tired of cutesy little speeches where everybody talks about hope and change and instead, after the confirmation, you get a nightmare, an eight year long nightmare where people are losing their jobs and the labor participation rate has slowed by 4 percent. Where you see millions have lost access to specialist, they have lost their health care completely or their premiums have increased to the point where they can't afford them, because of the un-affordable care act, they have seen jobs be crushed, they have seen manufacturing declined. It has, by all accounts, by all of these Americans who have endured this, being carnage for them. They have seen their dreams killed. They have lost their children to drugs. It has been incredibly awful. And that is why there were so many people and Democrats. Let us not forget that one of the huge voting blocks that turned out for Donald Trump on November 8th were blue-collar Democrats who had long been counted as a base voter by the Democratic Party.
MACCALLUM: You mad great points, but when you look at the snarkiness that we saw in some of the response to this, Richard, you know this sort of Megadeth and it represents this and that, I do think a lot of people who listened to this or who see that the way its presented, think, you don't get to me, either. You know, you don't understand what is going on in my life, either. Again, what is wrong with recognizing the reality that so many people who voted for Donald Trump are feeling out there and wouldn't your party be better off if perhaps they didn't make fun of that?
FOWLER: I don't think anybody from -- I don't think any Democratic elected official has made fun of that, right? But here is the truth. The truth is that people want to aspire to something and beyond that, I think we Democrats are looking for, Trump voters and people who didn't vote for Trump, were looking for, are real solutions to the problem. Trump didn't have any of those solutions and his ""make America great"" mean, he didn't tell us how he was going to fix it. He talked and complete and total platitudes. ""I'm going to build a wall."" Nobody knows how he is going to build it. Nobody knows where the wall is going to go. I will repeal Obamacare.
(CROSSTALK)
MACCALLUM: Based on nothing of it and what we have seen the last couple of days, action after action after action so that is awfully tough.
FOWLER: Wait a minute. We are still waiting for them to tell us what this ""Obamacare replacement"" is going to be. And they have it on the net. They have talked on platitudes.
LOESCH: I have an idea on that.
FOWLER: It is going to be choice, this, that, vocabulary words don't mean anything.
LOESCH: I've a great idea as to what the replacement would be. Why don't you go back and read all of the Republicans that have piled on.
FOWLER: But there is no bill filed now.
LOESCH: No, no, no, because that is where a lot of it is coming from. Don't talk over me, because you are afraid of it. Republicans filed in and Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid allowed them to die.
FOWLER: Here is the thing.
LOESCH: American carnage is administrative.
MACCALLUM: that is a banned name, by the way.
FOWLER: American carnage means American death, according to Webster.
MACCALLUM: He is pointing out the reality, that people do experience.
LOESCH: It is an inconvenient truth.
MACCALLUM: Richard and Dana, thanks guys. We will talk to you a lot next time. So still ahead, what is really behind President Trump's America first promise? One writer wanted to get to the bottom of that question, a phrase that offended some people. He unravels it for us when he joins us ahead. Plus, controversial campaign pledge from President Trump about the location of the U.S. Embassy in Israel is causing quite a stir in the Middle East. Brooke Goldstein and David Tafuri will be here to debate that, coming up next.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
DONALD TRUMP, THE 45TH PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: And we will send a clear signal that there is no daylight between America and our most reliable allies, the state of Israel.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
TRUMP: We will move the American embassy to the eternal capital of the Jewish people, Jerusalem.
(APPLAUSE)
(CHEERS)
(END VIDEO CLIP)
MACCALLUM: Developing tonight, there is intense backlash to President Trump's pledge to move the U.S. Embassy for Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. With some Palestinians living in Jerusalem, claiming that it will quote, trigger an explosion. Here to debate, Brooke Goldstein and a Human Rights Attorney and Director of the Law fair Project. David Tafuri is a former State Department official and former Obama campaign foreign policy adviser. David and Brooke, glad to have both of you with us tonight. Thank you for being here. Brooke, let me start with you. What is your take on this?
BROOKE GOLDSTEIN, HUMAN RIGHTS ATTORNEY: Well, you know my take is that there is a fundamental misunderstanding of the laws of cause and effect. Moving an office to Jerusalem is not is what is going to cost Islamist violence. It is imam's preaching death and violence as a legitimate response to hurt feelings, preaching reestablishment of the caliphate and throwing the Jews into the sea is, what is the direct cause of violence? You know what else? Islamist is angry about, cartoons of Mohammed, the failure to mutilate the genitals of young females. The education of women and the western world also angers Islamists. And just like we don't appease Islamist in those categories, we certainly do not appease Islamists when it comes to directing the foreign policy of the United States. I think it is a wonderful move. It is totally in compliance with not one, not two, but three acts of congress, including the Jerusalem embassy act of 1995 that directs the State Department to move its embassy to Jerusalem, the eternal capital of the Jewish state.
MACCALLUM: David, she lays out a good case. What is wrong with that?
DAVID TAFURI, FORMER STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL: I applaud President Trump for saying today, through his spokesman, that he is not going to do this right away, and he is going to continue to look at the issues. The reality is, is that each of our last three presidents, Obama, Bush, and Clinton, also set at some point during our campaign, they would move the embassy. When I got into office, they thought better of it. The reason is that moving the embassy has no practical benefit for the U.S. or for Israel. We should be thinking about strategies that are going to help improve U.S. interests in the Middle East right now. That means defeating ISIS. That means of solving the civil war in Syria, stopping the creation of failed states like Syria and getting the Middle East peace process between Israel and Palestine back on track.
MACCALLUM: I guess you could make an argument then.
TAFURI: This will not do any of those things.
MACCALLUM: Listen. I hear your argument. But you could make an argument that the things that we have done to sort of tiptoe around and hope that we will get backing from all of these countries really has not yielded fruit. It does not moving in embassy really make a difference when you look at all of the things that we have done to build a successful coalition against an Islamic extremism?
TAFURI: It has no benefit to the U.S. It doesn't help us at all. It doesn't help us do our job better in Israel. It doesn't help us do our job better in the Middle East. It doesn't help Israel, either. If we want to try and make a statement about Israel, do something to support Israel. Provide more military support. Invite Netanyahu here for a private meeting with the president. Let's do things that have an impact. This will incite violence in the Middle East and make it harder for us to get to Middle East.
GOLDSTEIN: I am surprised, David, that he would take that position. You penned a brilliant op-ed and CNN saying that the last thing we want to do is give into the territorial aspirations of ISIS. And that by allowing ISIS to continue, to think it can create an Islamic state, that is the appeasement of terrorism. And when you argue against moving the embassy, and what they are advocating for is to move it to west Jerusalem, which no one disputes to be the capital of Israel, what you are doing is arguing for the Islamist notion of from the river to the sea of Palestine will be free of Jews. You are encouraging appeasing terrorism. There is a general - ok. I will stop it there.
MACCALLUM: All right Brooke, thank you very much, you made a great point. David, you did as well. Good to have you both here tonight. Many thanks.
TAFURI: Thank you.
GOLDSTEIN: Thank you.
MACCALLUM: Still ahead, her brother paid the ultimate sacrifice in defense of our country. But on Friday night, her mere presence and trying to enter an inaugural ball lead to what she describes as an assault by protesters outside. We will speak with Gold Star family member Ryan Manion, straight ahead. Plus, President Trump has taken heat for his ""America first"" message. But what will that policy really mean during his presidency? ""Wall Street Journal"" columnist William McGurn wrote about that and he joins us here in studio coming up next.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
TRUMP: We assembled here today our issuing a new decree to be heard in every city, and every foreign capital, and in every hall of power. From this day forward, a new vision will govern our land. From this day forward, it's going to be only America first, America first.
(APPLAUSE)
(END VIDEO CLIP)
MACCALLUM: Another moment from President Trump's speech on inauguration day, as he vowed to uphold a campaign promise of putting America first. Some hit the president for his use of that phrase, suggesting that evokes a darker time in American history. Here now, William McGurn ""Wall Street Journal"" columnist and editorial board member, who wrote a piece on this issue this morning in his always great Mainstream column, William, great to see you. Thanks for being here today.
WILLIAM MCGURN, WALL STREET JOURNAL COLUMNIST: Good to see you.
MACCALLUM: So, America first is, some people think, a dog whistle for white people first. It also has historic connotations that Donald Trump has tried to separate himself from, your take?
MCGURN: My take. First of all, congratulations, I'm a big fan, the whole family. Second is the irony of this, I think Donald Trump means by America first, just America first. We are going to have other countries assume their share of the burden. I am not sure I'm on board with all of the policy. But the idea that it is the 1941 America first, the arch enemy, next to FDR of the 1941 movement was Winston Churchill, because the America first movement saw him as trying to get us into England's war. He just restored to the bust of Winston Churchill to the oval office. I think lead from behind, President Obama's thing, was a lot closer to the original spirit of America first. Plus, you have the president saying, he is going to destroy ISIS, so he is not saying, that this is not our fight. He has appointed men like John Mattis, Rex Tillerson. They are hardly cut from the 1941 cloth.
MACCALLUM: Yes, so when you look back at President Obama's perspective, you see him more as fitting into the America first, because he didn't really want to cross the red line.
MCGURN: Redline, you know the world would be peaceful or the Middle East would be peaceful if only we pulled our troops out. The Iranian demonstrators who called for our support, you know, we had nothing for them, nothing to help Ukraine defend itself against Russia. We don't know what Donald Trump is going to do on all of these issues. But the idea that Donald Trump is America first in the 1941 cents, when we just had eight years of it from president Obama.
MACCALLUM: Which is in terms of the pipeline decision as an example, he is talking about, you know, we will look at the application again, but we want a whole lot more U.S. Steel involved in these products.
MCGURN: This is a lot of Donald Trump. I love that he is building a pipeline. I'm a little less pleased that he said we are going to put the things that you have to buy in American steel, which will make the cost go up. It is kind of a mixed message in a lot of things. I think trade is one of the areas where he is weak.
MACCALLUM: He is trying to put more people to work. He is really angry that the steel companies have lost.
MCGURN: I am a free trader. The idea -- this is what makes our public projects so expensive. We put the wage requirements, we say, buy American and so forth, that is what sends the price.
MACCALLUM: William McGurn, always good to see you.
MCGURN: Thank you.
MACCALLUM: Thanks for stopping by. So coming up next, it was an event that was meant to pay tribute to Medal of Honor recipients. I believe there were 40 of them gathered, which is historic, last Friday night in Washington, D.C. But it didn't stop protesters from attacking the people who wanted to make their way in to that ball and one of them was Ryan Manion, whose brother, Travis, was killed while he was on duty in Iraq in 2007. He is an absolute hero who saved money. So, she is here to tell us her story, which is extraordinary. Stick around for it. It is right after this break. Stay with us.
MACCALLUM: Growing outrage tonight after Gold Star family members reveal that they were verbally and even physically attacked during last week's inauguration celebrations. The two women, one who lost her brother, the other, her husband, both killed in service to our country, say that they first spotted the protesters on Friday and took video of them in their car as they were arriving at this event. But the footage doesn't show what happened to them next when they got out of the car. They say they were pushed and spat on and called vile names by these protesters. Joining me now as Ryan Manion, whose brother, First Lieutenant Travis Manion, was killed in Iraq back in 2007, Ryan has worked on his behalf with Amy Looney with the Travis Manion Foundation ever since. Good to have you here tonight, Ryan. This is just an unbelievable story. Welcome.
RYAN MANION, GOLD STAR FAMILY MEMBER: Thanks for having me.
MACCALLUM: So, explained to us, I wanted to talk about your brother, too. He is the reason that you were there and he is the reason that you have honored him with the rest of your life. So, here you are, going to this event, to remember him. And what was said to you, what was done to you when you got out of the car and try to walk in?
MANION: I can't repeat the things that were said to me, but I don't think I can repeat them on cable television, but we found ourselves in a situation where we had to walk into a group of about 75 protesters. I honestly was not originally uncomfortable doing that, thinking that they had no reason to have any ill feelings towards us. But we realized very quickly, as soon as we kind of came upon them, that there was a lot of hatred in their eyes and they just started screaming a lot of vile obscenities at us, spitting towards us. For me, one of the most interesting things, they were yelling, ""Get a job, get a job"" and Amy and I, while we were terrified of the whole situation, the next day, when we were kind of digesting it all, we kind of laugh, because the idea of them telling us to get a job and our job every day is to instill character and our nation.
MACCALLUM: Did they have an idea that you were Gold Star families?
MANION: No. And I don't even think that they knew that we were going to a veteran's gala. I don't think they knew -- I think they looked it up, dressed up, knew that we were attending an inaugural event and immediately thought, you know, we are going to take our anger out on them.
MACCALLUM: That meant that they were yelling at you about. Talk to me a little bit before I let you go about Travis Manion who was such a hero and saved many lives on the day that he died.
MANION: Yes, you know my brother was my best friend, the inspiration behind the Travis Manion Foundation. Travis and Travis' good friend, Brendan Looney, they represent this generation of men and women who stand up and serve and for us, everyday is about getting up there and making sure that we understand why they served and sacrificed. And that is for people to peacefully protest. But we need to come together, despite our differences, I think the one common thing we can all agree on is that we love this country. I think it is time to open up a dialogue about how we move forward in a respectful and civil manner.
MACCALLUM: You are so right. Ryan, thank you very much. I'm sorry for what you went through. And we thank you and your family for the service that you have all given to the country. Thanks, Ryan. See you soon.
MANION: Thanks so much.
MACCALLUM: So Ryan's noble behavior in the face of that anger brings us to our quote for tonight. A founding father with some advice for us in these rancorous times, Thomas Jefferson said this. ""I never considered a difference of opinion and politics and religion, and philosophy, as a cause for withdrawing from a friend."" that we can all take to heart during these 100 days and beyond. If you have a quote that you would like to see at the end of the show, send it to me at Facebook.com/martha maccallum or you can send me a tweet at Martha MacCallum #firts100, President Trump's big day tomorrow, and immigration news to come. We will see you then."

MIKE PENCE, VICE PRESIDENT-ELECT OF THE UNITED STATES: The first order of business is to repeal and replace Obamacare. Obamacare has failed. And the American people have sent a decisive message to Washington, D.C., that they want Obamacare to be repealed and replaced with health care reform that will lower the cost of health insurance without growing the size of government.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
GIGOT: Welcome to the JOURNAL EDITORIAL REPORT. I'm Paul Gigot. 
A showdown on Capitol Hill this week with President Obama and Vice President-elect Pence both paying a visit to congressional leaders as the battle lines harden over the fight to repeal and replace Obamacare. Mr. Pence, as you just heard, told Republicans that it is the Trump administration's first order of business. While Mr. Obama told Democrats not to rescue the GOP by helping to pass a replacement. And as Republicans move ahead with the first part of their plan to repeal the controversial law, Democrats are gearing up for the fight and rolling out a brand-new slogan.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER, (D-NY), SENATE MINORITY LEADER: The Republican plan to cut health care wouldn't make America great again. It would make America sick again.
REP. NANCY PELOSI, (D-CA), HOUSE MINORITY LEADER: Make America sick again, is that what the Republicans want to do? I certainly hope not.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
GIGOT: Joining the panel this week, ""Wall Street Journal"" columnist and deputy editor, Dan Henninger; Washington columnist, Kim Strassel; editorial board member, Joe Rago; and columnist, Bill McGurn.
So, Joe, you cover health care for us. Tell us what this strategy -- what's behind this strategy of repeal first and replace later?
JOE RAGO, EDITORIAL BOARD MEMBER: Two things. They move to really fast and they don't have 60 Senate votes for repeal. They need to use a budget measure known as Reconciliation that allows them to repeal it with straight majority.
GIGOT: 51 votes.
(CROSSTALK)
RAGO: They're hoping to do that by mid-February or so. Then, over the next couple of months, build a consensus around a replacement measure for the law.
GIGOT: The repeal itself, and subsidies and other things, would be two years out, three years out, the actual end of the current subsidies and taxes?
RAGO: Right. You will have to have some kind of a phase-in, ramp-up for whatever the replacement is. But I think they really need to, in matter of months, not two or three years, come up with how they're going to put in -- substitute more market-oriented that increases affordability, and access to health coverage.
GIGOT: Democrats are already saying, look, you repeal this, what is going to happen to health insurance markets? Are people going to lose their coverage? Are insurers going to pull out even more than they already have out of the exchanges? The trends on Obamacare have been terrible in terms of fewer choice, higher prices. But are Republicans taking ownership of this politically if they pass repeal?
RAGO: I mean, that is the big risk. The individual market right now is just so fragile. If they run into political problems and the process drags out into the fall into next year, what will happen to the health insurance markets, you will not have stability, you will not have predictability, and you could have a practical problem on your hands with people losing coverage. What we learned when the law rolled out in 2013, people do not like disruptions to their insurance.
GIGOT: Kim, why do you think the Republicans feel they need to repeal this right away? Do they feel need to honor a campaign promise and put up an early win despite the risks, which are very real, as Joe described?
KIM STRASSEL, WASHINGTON COLUMNIST: Absolutely. This has been their theme for six years in every election, elect us and we will repeal Obamacare. So, to come in and not make it a top priority would be political malpractice. I think they would risk losing the respect of a lot of voters that decided to trust them with Washington. So, they have to do this, and that has put them in a little bit of a rock and a hard place.
GIGOT: That rock and a hard place is Chuck Schumer on the Democratic side, Bill, who is not going to cooperate, I think, very much at all to help replace it. And maybe some people on the right, Ted Cruz, others -- Rand Paul this week said he doesn't want to help repeal Obamacare because it might add to the budget deficit.
BILL MCGURN, COLUMNIST: Right.
GIGOT: So you end up with a purist on the right saying, I'm never going to vote for tax subsidies, and Chuck Schumer, says, I will never help you Republicans at all, what happens if, six months, nine months, they can't have a replacement.
MCGURN: The Democrats are very happy in some ways they are going to get rid of Obamacare. This was the one big answer --
(CROSSTALK)
GIGOT: You mean politically, politically.
MCGURN: This was one big answer, a new solution that was going to be revolutionary and change things for the better. Didn't work. They are happy. We had it for six years. They're happy to dump it off.
I'm more optimistic because there are a lot of pitfalls. We can go through them. But if they have momentum, get one part down on the replace part, it creates the conditions for further things down the road. So, I think that the main thing is that they need to show momentum. They have the repeal and show good things being done. Because our goal is not -- the problem is, Obamacare is like closing down a nuclear plant. You know, there is all this waste.
(LAUGHTER)
You can't just turn it off and walk away. You have to be careful with that waste because it can kill you in the meantime. So, I think they just have to have the momentum.
GIGOT: The argument is that you hear, and I hear is, OK, we'll have this replacement deadline a couple years and that will concentrate the mind. The political hanging will concentrate the mind. I know politicians. They think it will be the other politician that will being hung, not them. Nobody wants to take a difficult vote. I think there will be trouble for Republicans to get this done.
DAN HENNINGER, COLUMNIST & DEPUTY EDITOR: It is going to be difficult, for sure. But, look, let's start with a fundamental here, which is that Obamacare, the law, is not popular with the public. This isn't merely a political football. It is the health care system. While not everybody is involved with Obamacare, those who are have had a terrible experience. I'm not sure the Democrats want to be seen out there as simply being totally obstructionist and not allowing this process to go forward. The Republicans need to be transparent. They need to show momentum. I'm a little hard put, though, to see where there's benefit for Democrats saying we won't participate in this.
GIGOT: Kim, Democrats cooperate, but Kim, you wrote a column this week saying that the Republicans should not repeat Obama's mistake, being totally partisan, they should reach out to Democrats, but is there any prospect they will get some help?
STRASSEL: It is if they do this piecemeal. That is what you see Republicans increasingly coalescing around. Rather than one great big replace measure, they will take a piece here, a piece there, issues that then appeal to specific Democrats and those that are up for re-election in two-years-time, and put a lot of pressure on them in their home states. And try to turn this around on them as well, say, the only people who are, in fact, making America sick again are those of you who are helping us to fix the problem. So, this is going to be their strategy. I think they think if they attack this on a little bit more of a piece-by-piece basis, they have a shot.
GIGOT: They can make progress.
Thanks, Kim.
Still ahead, as the 115th Congress is sworn in, all eyes are on the Republican majority. After Obamacare's repeal, we'll tell you what else is on the to-do list for the GOP.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
REP. PAUL RYAN, (R-WI), SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE: And to the majority, especially to our returning members, I want to say this, this is a once-in- a-lifetime opportunity. The people have given us unified government. And it wasn't because they were feeling generous. It was because they want results.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
GIGOT: That was Paul Ryan addressing his fellow Republicans Tuesday after he was officially sworn in as House speaker, with the GOP in control of the presidency and both houses of Congress for the first time in a decade.
We're back with a look at what they can do and what they must do in the first year.
So, Dan, let's step back a year from now, if we're looking back at that first year of Congress, what would a successful year look like? What would they have done?
HENNINGER: I think the first thing we should say, these Republicans, if you look at the to-do list, may have bitten off more than any Congress can possibly chew in a year. Certainly, they have to get the Supreme Court replacement for Antonin Scalia confirmed.
GIGOT: OK.
HENNINGER: That's the top of the list.
Secondly, I think they should have a tax reform bill done by the end of the year, and perhaps some financial reform.
GIGOT: Dodd-Frank, regulatory?
HENNINGER: Dodd-Frank. Look, Obamacare was a big issue in the election. The economy was bigger. The Republicans and President Trump have got to get the economy restarted. That means doing economic reform, getting the government off the economy's back. How they will do that simultaneously with the sort of Obamacare process, repeal and replace that we were just discussing, that's going to be difficult.
GIGOT: Supreme Court, tax reform, regulatory relief. What else do you want to see, Bill?
MCGURN: I think regulatory relief is part of a broader reform of how the government does business. In the Obama years, we worked through the courts and federal agencies. What I am hoping is the appointment of Carl Icahn means there will be a unified approach across all agencies.
GIGOT: He's an outside advisor, the Wall Street investor.
MCGURN: Right. That is really what a lot of businesses complain about, this regulatory overreach and so forth. And the process has been corrupted as well, without the proper hearings and the time and so forth. So, I'm -- I have a lot of hope. I think, as a businessman, Donald Trump understands the problems of the regulatory burden. He's probably dealt with them personally.
GIGOT: Anything else on the list, Joe, that you think they need to get done? And what do you think they will get done? Are you optimistic as these two guys?
RAGO: I think they might end up overloading their bandwidth. I think they have to do those big things. But you heard Paul Ryan say the people elected us to get results, and they have to keep that goal in mind with every -- every bill they pass. They have got to get growth from 2 percent to 3 to 4 percent in order to get wages rising. That is what they will be held accountable for.
GIGOT: Kim, I want to read a Donald Trump tweet this week about a big ethics flap on Capitol Hill where Congress, Republicans tried to change a rule to modify an outside ethics watchdog. Trump weighed in with this: ""With all that Congress has to work on, do they really have to make the weakening of the independent ethics watchdog, as unfair as it may be, their number-one act and priority? Focus on tax reform, health care, and so many other things of far greater importance.""
So, thanks a lot, Mr. Trump.
(LAUGHTER)
You know, weighing in like Nancy Pelosi against the Republicans. And the Republicans stampeded and they caved and they changed their mind. Will that happen to Republicans every time? They will scatter like wildebeest every time Donald Trump gives a tweet?
STRASSEL: Look, I think one of the reasons they scattered is he actually was, in fact, making a pretty good point here, because the Congressional Ethics Office is a problem. But they ended up putting up a bill, they had not laid the groundwork for it. It looked bad, the press said that Democrats were able to redefine it for them. This was the not moment they should have been doing it. They just got elected. You don't run and immediately say we're going to tackle a priority that they hadn't even talked about really publicly before. So, he had a point, and they scattered.
But this is --- you make a good point, is that he has got a lot of power via 140 characters on Twitter. And I think, at times, he may use that to impose some discipline. But it could also end up spreading a lot of disarray within the Republican caucus, too.
GIGOT: Yeah. I think this is leadership issue. The leadership said, don't do this. The rank-and-file overruled them, they did it, and then they reversed themselves. They should have said, if you don't want to do this, don't do it.
HENNINGER: Yeah. It makes it clear that politicians on Capitol Hill are perfectly capable of running off the rails.
But I want to make a point in defense of Donald Trump's operating method here, the tweets and so forth. Look, he's come to Washington to change Washington. Washington doesn't move. The political process is extremely difficult. They would rather do nothing. Trump is like the proverbial taking a two-by-four to the side of the head of a donkey. That is what his job will be. He will have to do that to shake them up to get them to move.
GIGOT: OK. Now, what about paying for the wall, Bill? That story came out later in the week, there is a wall on the Mexican border. He is saying, well, we'll get Congress to pay for it.
MCGURN: Right, and be reimbursed later.
GIGOT: Not the Mexicans after all.
MCGURN: Well, he is saying the Mexicans will pay later.
GIGOT: Sure.
MCGURN: Look, we have always been dubious about this. If you're going to build the wall, it really should come through the legislative process. Let Congress do it.
GIGOT: And it is an American wall.
MCGURN: But he may pay the price.
Look, I think we should look at priorities from the opposite point of view. What is the worst thing that can happen to Donald Trump and his presidency, except a year from now, the working people that put him in, my life hasn't improved, I don't see job prospects, I don't see this. It's kind of this side of Joe's argument, economic growth. They really need to do things and things that will get the economy moving. The stock market seems to be reacting pretty well to his things, but it has to go down to ordinary people.
GIGOT: Thank you, Bill.
When we come back, Republican leaders counting down to the Trump presidency and gearing up for an historic opportunity. Is the time for a tax overhaul finally here? We'll ask economist Art Laffer next.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
PENCE: We're going to be working with the Congress over the course of the first several months to construct the kind of tax reform for businesses and individuals that will unleash the bound-up energy in the American economy.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
GIGOT: Vice President-elect Mike Pence this week putting tax reform at the top of the GOP's ambitious agenda, promising to move ahead on an overhaul in the Trump administration's first month. It is something Republicans in Congress have been advocates and planning for years.
Economist Art Laffer is chairman of Laffer Associates and was an economic advisor to President Ronald Reagan. He joins me from Nashville.
Arthur, great to see you again.
ART LAFER, ECONOMIST & CHAIRMAN, LAFFER ASSOCIATES: Good to see you, Paul. Thank you. It's fun.
GIGOT: OK. So, the stock market rally since election day has been big. What are investors looking for, anticipating?
LAFFER: I think they're anticipating tax rate reform. I think they're anticipating a lower corporate tax, for sure. When you discount those profits coming forward, it leads to a fairly attractive stock market. I think this stock market reflects their optimism about the future.
GIGOT: Should we be concerned there is a stall in the rally last three or four weeks?
LAFFER: Not really. We had a similar situation when Reagan came into office, and the market then went way down, as you may know. In August of 1982, the market hit its trough. It was down from Reagan coming into office to August of 1982, and then, boom, it you had the biggest boom of all time.
GIGOT: Is corporate tax reform, and tax reform more broadly, is that, for you, the centerpiece of this growth agenda? Is that one thing they have to get done to ensure growth?
LAFFER: He really needs tax reform, you do, but Obamacare is serious regulations are serious. I hope he symbolically gets rid of the death tax. That would be a shot across the bow we'll have a major change in policy going forward. The death tax is just disgusting. You collect no money and put barriers everywhere. But the corporate tax down to 15 percent, Paul, will go a long way bringing back prosperity.
GIGOT: Trump's tax rate is 20 percent, though -- excuse me, the Republican rate is 20 percent. Trump's is 15. If they do 20 percent, can you live with that?
LAFFER: Of course.
(LAUGHTER)
Of course, I can. It is such a low bar.
(LAUGHTER)
Let me say, Paul, this administration has such a low bar, it would be an act of fearless aggression if they could worsen the economy. You just can't do that.
And not only is it a low bar for the economy, just like we had after Jimmy Carter, but they don't have any chance of losing Congress in two years, in 2018, because the tilt is way against the Democrats. So, they have four years to get this economy going. And that is the single and only thing they need to do. All these optics and all this other stuff is just nonsense. If they get the economy growing, they will win re-election in a landslide in 2020. If they don't, they won't. That's it.
GIGOT: That really does focus on tax reform.
You've been a free trader all your life, Art, I know.
LAFFER: Yes.
GIGOT: You view it as one of the pillars of an economic growth country and an economic growth strategy. So, what do you make of this plank of the Republican House tax bill, which is the first one that will move, called Border Adjustability, which means you levy a 20 percent corporate tax rate, if that is the final rate that turns out to be, on imports but you don't levy that tax on exports? A lot --
(CROSSTALK)
LAFFER: Rebate it. Rebate it to exports.
GIGOT: A lot of people, retailers say it will raise prices for consumers. It is protectionist. How do you respond to that?
LAFFER: The truth of the matter is a border tax adjustment is a nothing policy. What you're doing is a tax on imports is the same thing as tax on exports. That is Lerner's Symmetry Theorem. So, if you have a tax on exports and a subsidy on exports of the equal sides, they offset each other. This is way of pandering to people who want protectionism without having any protectionism. A border tax adjustment is not a problem, but a tariff as a stand-alone is very serious problem.
GIGOT: But the border adjustment is the first order of business. Until exchange rates adjust, it will raise prices for retailers who import their goods, Walmart and others, will it not?
LAFFER: It could. It could. You will have an adjustment globally to the new border tax adjustment. But that is exactly what they do with the VAT in Europe. So, it is a very common practice to be done. I hope it just buys off the protection its and gets them out of the way so we can focus on good things like tax reform and like freer trade.
GIGOT: Look, on the trade side, you've got a lineup of people --
LAFFER: I know.
GIGOT: -- you know, Peter Navarro in the White House, a new office of trade that we haven't had before. Bob Lighthizer, a steel protectionist lawyer and trade representatives lawyer. Wilbur Ross, another steel owner, who is at the Commerce Department. That is a quite a lineup, and a very different line up of trade people you saw in the Reagan administration or, frankly, in any administration in a long time. How much does it worry you?
LAFFER: It does worry me. It is one economic area that worries me a lot, Paul. This is the one economic area that bothers me. But in all honesty, these bills have to go through Congress. They have to go through the House and Senate and through the committees. And there will be a lot of moderation there.
And the one thing that is really is true, the trade agreements that have been done are really one-sided and they really are bad. For example, in Japan, the non-tariff barriers, it would cost you about $50,000 to retrofit a U.S. car to be able to be sold in Japan. That is protectionism in the extreme. You can see what it is doing to Japan. Their economy is really the worst ever.
GIGOT: Except we don't have a trade deal with Japan, Art. The whole point --
LAFFER: That's the point.
GIGOT: -- of the TPP was to try to get one to reduce those barriers in Japan.
LAFFER: But they aren't.
GIGOT: And Trump doesn't want to pass that.
LAFFER: But it doesn't do that. It ignores, it excludes all the non- tariff barriers and it excludes currency manipulation. You know very well that Japan devalued the yen to explicitly improve their trade balance, which is a silly idea to begin with and hurts Japan. But that's why they did it. And yet, currency manipulation has been excluded from these deals. What I would like to see is one that includes China and all these countries and do a real trade one, like Kennedy round tariff negotiation where we dropped all tariffs by 35 percent, or something really major, rather than these awful little bills that have all these exclusions, deduct all this stuff that makes no sense to me.
GIGOT: Let's look ahead a little bit, Art. The Dow now is about a little under 20,000. Where do you see it going at end of the year? Do we see 22, 23, 25?
LAFFER: This year, 2017, I think we'll be very happy if it is just up at all for the year.
GIGOT: Really?
LAFFER: I mean, the first -- well, yeah. If you pass a tax bill, it won't really take effect, Paul, until January 1st, 2018.
GIGOT: OK.
LAFFER: That is when rates -- also, if you know they have tax cuts next year, what do you do this year? You defer income, your employment for a year. That's exactly what happened to us and Reagan. We passed a great tax bill that started on January 1st, 1983.
GIGOT: Right.
LAFFER: And that caused the '81-'82 deep recession. So, we'll have some of those delay effects happening here. I think the first year is just to get their feet on the ground, get bills in place. Then I think by 2018, '19, '20, you will see this economy skyrocket. Once it starts, you can't stop it. They will all join on board and it will be a race for the exit. It will be fun.
GIGOT: Thank you, Arthur, for being here. Good to see you.
LAFFER: Thank you, Paul.
GIGOT: Still ahead, so just how will Democrats respond to Donald Trump and his agenda? We'll get our first glimpse next week as the president-elect's picks for some top cabinet posts face Senate confirmation hearings.
PAUL GIGOT, FOX HOST: With confirmation hearings set to begin next week for President-elect Donald Trump's cabinet nominees, Senate Democrats are gearing up for a protracted fight, reportedly, planning to target eight of his choices in a move that would stretch their confirmation votes in March and up-end Republican hopes of confirming most of Trump's picks on Inauguration Day.
We're back with Dan Henninger, Kim Strassel, Joe Rago and Bill McGurn.
So, Kim, Chuck Schumer, the new Senate Democratic leader, taking the place of Harry Reid, gave his inaugural speech this week. What was the main takeaway from your part?
KIM STRASSEL, WASHINGTON COLUMNIST: Fight, fight, fight, obstruct, obstruct, obstruct. There was all this enthusiasm that Chuck Schumer might be more of a wheeler-dealer than Harry Reid but, coming out of the gate here, it appears that Democrats are going to try to take down a bunch of these nominees, if they possibly can. They're at least going to drag this process out as long as they can, try to drag some of these people through the mud and in the hopes of at least getting one or two scalped in the end.
GIGOT: Yeah. Joe, I heard Schumer say we will cooperate on trade maybe, infrastructure maybe, as long as it's public spending, not any private tax credits, and closing the corporate -- the carried interest loophole, which is a minor part of tax reform. I didn't hear a lot of willingness to cooperate on other things.
JOE RAGO, EDITORIAL BOARD MEMBER: No. What I heard was Schumer saying, as long as Donald Trump governs like a Democratic, we will be happy to cooperate with him. The big question is whether that is going to last over time. Trump is going to do things like on infrastructure and trade that -- a lot of Democrats are probably going to support. Are they going to really obstruct him on everything? I don't know.
DAN HENNINGER, COLUMNIST & DEPUTY EDITOR: I can see an argument, though, for it, Paul. Look, Donald Trump is president because he breached the Democrat's blue wall of the Electoral College, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, brought those voters to the Republican camp, mainly for economic reasons. If he obstructs, if he makes it difficult for them to, say, pass a tax bill or get the economy going again, the general Republic is not going to be aware of that kind of obstruction.
GIGOT: No, not in the least.
HENNINGER: And they'll simply blame Donald Trump.
GIGOT: Sure.
HENNINGER: He's the president. He owns the economy.
GIGOT: He said he would get things done and, somehow, it's just the same -
(CROSSTALK)
HENNINGER: He's not happening.
GIGOT: That's the advantage that Schumer has, Bill. He's got 48 Senators. A lot -- 10 of them, I think, are up in 2010, who are red --
BILL MCGURN, COLUMNIST: In red states.
GIGOT: 2018, the states that Trump carried. But all he needs is 41 Democrats to have a filibuster and block -- and block --
MCGURN: My sense, though, is Chuck Schumer's bark is a lot worse than his fight. I think Harry Reid was a tougher guy. And the advantaged for some of these others guys, I am not sure will be the same. The problem he has at the national level is the same problem that the local Democratic Party has in some of these dysfunctional big cities. They have driven out a lot of the saner people in the middle, so the people that are left get hardened into policies. If he has Keith Ellison as head of DNC --
GIGOT: The Democratic National Committee.
MCGURN: national committee -- he's going to have a lot of problems.
(CROSSTALK)
GIGOT: He's endorsed Ellison.
MCGURN: Right.
GIGOT: Schumer has.
MCGURN: So I think he's going to have a lot of problems within the party.
And let me say, it's not just Chuck Schumer. California hired Eric Holder to represent them in fights they're anticipating. Eric Holder was impeached and didn't exactly have a great record --
(CROSSTALK)
GIGOT: Democrats for federalism.
(CROSSTALK)
MCGURN: I am not sure this is going to -- this obstruction thing is going to play well. they may get few victories but I am not sure it's going to help their party.
GIGOT: Kim, let me read the list of the eight cabinet nominees who are going to be challenged: Jeff Sessions; Betsy DeVos for Education; Andy Puzder, Labor; Rex Tillerson, State Department; Mick Mulvany at OMB, the budget office; Tom Price, HHS; Steve Mnuchin, Treasury; and Mr. Pruitt of Oklahoma at EPA.
Any of those in particular you think could be in trouble?
STRASSEL: I mean, I don't know if one or the other will be in trouble. This is why they are demanding all of these particular hearings and questionnaires because they're looking for something that they might be able to pin on at least one of them, and then they will surround that particular one and try to bring that one down. They want to claim at least one of these nominees.
But, I mean, again, this -- what the Republicans have going for them -- Bill makes a good point -- is, in their local states, some Senators that are up for election in 2018, five of them, by the way, in states where Trump absolutely stumped Hillary Clinton, they are going to be nervous about being portrayed as people who are standing in the way of change, so you've already got guys like West Virginia Senator Joe Manchin coming out and approving some Trump nominees, publicly, and I think this is what the Republicans are going to hope for.
GIGOT: All right, it's a contrast with 2009 when Republicans really didn't do much at all to stop Democratic nominees, even Tim Geithner, who had not paid all of his taxes.
So, still ahead, another battle brewing on Capitol Hill as President-elect Trump narrows his list of potential Supreme Court nominees, and Democrats threaten to hold open the seat once held by Antonin Scalia.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL, (R-KY), SENATOR MAJORITY LEADER: Apparently, there is, yet, a new standard now, which is to not confirm a Supreme Court nominee at all.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER, (D-NY), SENATE MINORITY LEADER: Let's see who they nominate. If they're in the mainstream, we will give them a very careful look. If they are out of the mainstream, we will oppose them tooth and nail.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
GIGOT: Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer this week previewing what is likely to be a bitter fight over who will replace the late Justice Antonin Scalia on the Supreme Court and promising to block any Trump pick who Democrats consider out of the mainstream. Schumer's comments come amid reports the president-elect has narrowed his list of potential nominees to about eight, down from more than 20 he had identified during the presidential campaign.
""Wall Street Journal"" editorial board member, Colin Levy, joins us with more.
Colin, despite the warning, do you think president-elect is going to nominate somebody from his campaign list?
COLIN LEVY, EDITORIAL BOARD MEMBER: Yeah, I think he will. He has a really good list there. There's a lot of strong conservatives. I think those were well supported during the campaign. I think they really are very interesting, to the base. Some of the great names out there, you know, Bill Pryor, Diane Sykes on the 7th circuit.
GIGOT: Right.
LEVY: Those are often discussed as two leader candidates. But, as we can discuss, there are also some other ones out there that may be personally interesting to Trump.
GIGOT: Will anybody -- I mean, Schumer defines mainstream his own way. Is everybody on that list out of the mainstream by Chuck Schumer's definition?
LEVY: By Chuck Schumer's definition, no question, anyone nominated by a Republican president is out of mainstream, right? So, either way, this is going to be an epic fight, Paul, there is no question about that.
GIGOT: Bill Pryor, a federal judge for a longtime, I think he's a favorite for a lot of people because he has real long track record as an appellate judge and he's a solid conservative. There's no doubt what you're getting. He's not going to be David Souter. May not be Anthony Kennedy. And Republicans have been burned before so I think Pryor is maybe the favorite. What do you think?
LEVY: Yeah. I think Pryor is the leading contender for the reasons you mentioned. They know this is going to be a big fight. They're going to have a really big fight. They might as well get someone they are sure is going to fill the shoes of Scalia.
I think, though, we should not discount Diane Sykes because she is also a very, very strong conservative, has a long track record, has great opinions on the 7th circuit on the First Amendment. She wrote the opinion in Wisconsin's right to life, you know, a very strong First Amendment opinion.
GIGOT: Right.
LEVY: She also has very good Second Amendment decisions, up holding Heller, upholding the constitutionality of firing ranges. So, she is a real favorite, too.
GIGOT: There are some other very, very solid circuit court judges. And there's Joan Larson, on the Michigan Supreme Court. She's something of a wild card because she's only been on that Supreme Court for about a year. She did clerk for Justice Scalia, but her judicial track record isn't as well-known.
LEVY: No.
GIGOT: She's also younger, only 48.
LEVY: That's right, for sure. And she strikes me as someone who would be great second-round pick if another opening comes up. I would be surprised if she comes up this time. Her track record isn't that long. There's also Tom Hardeman, out of Pennsylvania, a guy sort of a working- class guy, someone who might just appeal to Trump on gut level. Neil Gorsuch (ph) is also a guy very well liked by conservatives because he has a very strong writing style and he is just considered to be sort of a high-wattage, super-smart jurist.
GIGOT: OK.
LEVY: So he's someone that also might be in the mix.
GIGOT: Kim, what about this idea that this seat is stolen? Democrats are saying, look, the Republicans stole the set because they never gave a vote to Merrick Garland, President Obama nominee, since Scalia died in February. Is this going to -- this is going to raise the temperature on the Democratic opposition, isn't it?
STRASSEL: It is. I mean, this is going to be their mantra all the way through, that, and justification for everything that they use to oppose the Republican nominee. It will partly be the ideology, as Chuck Schumer said, out of mainstream, but it will partly be, hey, you never had the right to fill this seat because you took it from us.
Now, again, whether or not that washes, whether or not the pressure on some of these red-state Democrats grows to not obstruct what is, by any measure. Look, too -- this is important, Paul -- this is a seat that was already held by a very conservative jurist.
GIGOT: Right.
STRASSEL: And Republicans will make that point, that they are simply replacing one and it's not changing the balance of the court. So, some Democrats might be wary of opposing on that.
GIGOT: Will Mitch McConnell, Dan, have to break a filibuster by Democrats for the first time in history for a Supreme Court nominee?
HENNINGER: If the Democrats try to filibuster, say, Bill Pryor or Diane Sykes, the filibuster is gone. There is just no way he can allow that to happen.
GIGOT: Will Republicans have the votes for that? There are some senior Republicans, John McCain --
(CROSSTALK)
HENNINGER: I think they are more concerned about the legislative filibuster, which is the reason for being a Senator, but they will not be able to oppose it on the Supreme Court.
GIGOT: Thank you all.
When we come back, we will go from Capitol Hill to the college campus where critics say the Obama Education Department has twisted the law known as Title IX to stifle free speech and deny due process in campus rape cases. Could changes be coming with a new administration?
GIGOT: Turning from Capitol Hill to the college campus, where my next guest says outgoing Obama administration has used the federal anti- discrimination law known as Title IX, to stifle free speech and deny due process in campus sexual assault cases.
Robert Shibley is the executive director of the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education and author of the book, ""Twisting Title IX"".
So, Mr. Shibley, welcome.
ROBERT SHIBLEY, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, FOUNDATION FOR INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS IN EDUCATION & AUTHOR: Thank you for having me.
GIGOT: You wrote for us, recently, that there are kangaroo courts on campus in dealing with these kinds of sexual assault accusations. What do you mean by that?
SHIBLEY: Well, campus courts, even though many times, they are trying to determine the same facts, whether or not a sexual assault or harassment occurred on campus, they have very, very low standards for making those determinations. And part of that low standard is driven by activity and mandates from the Department of Education in Washington, D.C.
GIGOT: All right, so as I gather, they only require a preponderance-of- evidence standard, which basically means, if it's a kind of 50-50 case, as long as you get to 51 percent, it is OK. A very different standard than you would get in a general criminal court, for example. Is that -- is that the issue? Is that where it comes down to?
SHIBLEY: Yeah, I think I think that is a big part of the problem. one of the -- the higher standard of evidence than preponderance is one of the very few due-process protections that students at some colleges were able to count on before this 2011 ""Dear Colleague"" letter that came out with this mandate, we think, and we are actually involved in a lawsuit saying it violated the Administrative Procedure Act, putting that mandate in place. And so, what has happened is now colleges can be far, far less certain of whether or not an assault occurred or even whether they have the right person --
GIGOT: Right.
SHIBLEY: -- for the assault and still punish them.
GIGOT: They have to do that because they live in fear that, if they don't do that, the administration, the Obama administration will crack down on them and have -- and punish them in some way by denying them federal money, for example, they get a big controversial case the government doesn't like.
SHIBLEY: That is right. The punishment is actually the withdrawal of all federal funds, the punishment that would be a death penalty for most campus, public and private. Almost every university in America, public and private, get a lot of federal funds, particularly from Pell Grants and Stafford loans. And this punishment is so severe and so scary that it has never been implemented before. Colleges are worried that if they don't follow these dictates, that is what's going to happen to them.
GIGOT: You would agree, I assume, that sexual assault is a problem on some campuses. I mean, you are talking about young people here, young men, in particular, some of them not very mature. How do you -- and I think the administration would say, look, we need this tough standard to be able to stop what is the rampant problem on college campuses. What is your response to that?
SHIBLEY: My response is that if sexual assault is happening on campus, that is really a matter for law enforcement. These are series crimes. They deserve serious investigation by people with the tools to actually conduct those investigations in a competent way. And we're seeing, by last count, more than 130 lawsuits from students who feel like they have been unfairly found responsible for sexual assaults on campus, the vast majority of whom were never prosecuted by police or outside law enforcement, who ought to be investigating.
GIGOT: Your organization is helping with some of those lawsuits. How are they proceeding in court? Are you winning those or is it too early to tell?
SHIBLEY: Well, it's too early to tell. There has been a lot of motions back-and-forth, so we will see how that goes forward. But we are involved in one case, in particularly, really targeting that preponderance mandate from the Department of Education.
GIGOT: If you were -- so you are Betsy DeVos, the new education secretary. Let's say you're confirmed. You come in. What do you do to -- to stop this? Do you -- how do you send a signal that this is going to stop and you are changing and going back to the pre-Obama standard?
SHIBLEY: Well, because they didn't actually go through the proper procedure to get these written -- as official regulations, it's actually as simply as sending out a new ""Dear Colleague"" letter saying we withdraw the preponderance mandate and other aspects of the 2011 ""Dear Colleague"" letter. They also need to revise the way they are defining sexual assault harassment. Right now, they are defining sexual harassment so broadly that overhearing a single dirty joke is technically sexual harassment on a college campus.
GIGOT: Wow.
SHIBLEY: There is no way that can be sustained under the Constitution. They know that. And they ought to stop promulgating that definition immediately.
GIGOT: But you don't have to -- she doesn't have to do a formal rulemaking in that case. All she needs to do is essentially send alternative guidance saying that -- what you got -- that letter you got in 2011 and the standards that the previous administration had been enforcing no longer apply.
SHIBLEY: That's right. And it is -- you know, while -- while it is sort of simple, it's not going to be easy. I think there will be a lot of political pressure on them not to do that. But it's the right thing to do. And, you know, it is -- it will send a signal that colleges ought to be able to come up with their own standards and figure out how to do it best on their campuses with law enforcement.
GIGOT: Thank you, Robert Shibley. Good to have you here.
We have to take one more break. When we come back, ""Hits & Misses"" of the week.
GIGOT: Time now for out ""Hits & Misses"" of the week.
Kim, start us off.
STRASSEL: Paul, this is a miss to Chicago, which ended 2016 with a stunning 762 homicides, a 57 percent increase, and more death than L.A. and New York combined. This is also the city that began 2017 with the abduction of a white special needs man by four black Chicagoans who took him and beat him and were emboldened enough to show this torture on Facebook Live. This is a testament that the war on cops is working. The police are backing off after all these politicized attacks and the leaders in cities increasingly deserve to give an explanation to residents that you are living in war-torn ghetto zones.
GIGIT: Thanks, Kim.
Bill?
MCGURN: A hit to all the former presidents. You know, for a while, it looked like none of the presidents were going to attend the inaugural. We learned this week they will all attend, except George H.W. Bush, who is not well enough to come. These are important moments, when you have a ceremony, and we should be grateful for all for all of them for this gracious note.
GIGOT: And bravo to Hillary Clinton for saying she will attend.
MCGURN: Right.
GIGOT: Colin?
LEVY: Paul, good news in Ohio this week. Governor John Kasich signed a law so that citizens can't have their property confiscated without first being convicted of a crime. These civil forfeiture laws have become a favorite tool of police, who like to use them to shore up budgets. But that money has come at the expense of due process and justice. So, kudos to Governor Kasich for getting rid of it.
GIGOT: Thanks,
Dan?
HENNIKNGER: Paul, I am getting a hit to 10 Senate Democrats, which I admit is a little bit like a solar eclipse. But, nonetheless, these 10 voted for a Senate measure repudiating the Obama administration's abstention from the U.N. Security Council resolution condemning Israel's settlements. This was good on its own merits but, Paul, it also suggests, the 10 Democratic votes, that Obama's legacy could be in peril on other things, like if they revisit the Iran nuclear deal.
GIGOT: All right.
And remember, if you have your own hit or miss be sure to tweet it to us, @jeronfnc.
That's it for this week's show. Thanks to my panel. Thanks to all of you for watching. I am Paul Gigot. Hope to see you right here next week."
0	7	 8 von 72	Fox News Network	January 6, 2017 Friday	 FOX HANNITY	 10:00 PM EST		"SEAN HANNITY, HOST: This is a ""FOX News Alert,"" the FBI holding a press conference on the Florida airport shooing rampage. We go there right now to the presser.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: ... number of individuals that evacuated out of the terminal onto the apron areas. We've been working most of the day to make sure that everybody was obviously safe and secure. Once we received that word from our law enforcement partners, we've been in the process of either transporting those individuals over to Port Everglades, terminal 4. We've had dozens and dozens of buses transporting what we anticipate or expect to be somewhere in the neighborhood of about 10,000 folks over to Port Everglades.
Broward County staff, as well as the Red Cross, are over there to assist those passengers in either getting them to their destination, assisting with hotel accommodations, providing them food and shelter.
Through this evening, we're going to continue to work with our law enforcement partners here as we continue to try to get the airport back into an operational status, working with all our airlines, the Transportation Security Administration and others to try to get the Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport back in operation tomorrow morning. 
The goal will be to have us operational at 0500, 5:00 AM tomorrow morning, but we're going to be encouraging all our travelers to check with their individual airlines, as some may not be operating right away. Clearly, this incident has caused a lot of disruption not only in their individual schedules but other schedules around the country. So we encourage everybody to actually contact their airlines.
We will continue to provide information through social media, through Twitter @fllflyer, through our Web page, and we encourage people to keep checking those sources for any changes.
That's all I have for the time being.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Good evening. As the sheriff mentioned, the FBI is working very, very closely with the Broward sheriff's office in this investigation.
We have begun the difficult task of processing the crime scene, which will allow us to identify the deceased and making the proper notification to the family members.
As you can imagine, with this type of investigation and this type of incident, it is a long-term, very difficult, complex investigation that requires us to pursue all leads and avenues. We are conducting an investigation not only here in south Florida, but in several other states as we try to pursue the suspect's activities leading up to today's horrific incident.
The subject is in federal because this my custody. As the sheriff mentioned, a long interview was conducted of the individual by the FBI and Broward sheriff's office. And he will be charged federally and most likely will have his initial appearance in Broward on Monday.
Again, as I mentioned, with these types of incidents, as horrific as they are, we are looking at all avenues. We have not ruled out terrorism, and we will be pursuing every angle to try to determine the motive behind this attack and any associates, any connections, communication, anything that you can imagine. I assure you, we are pursuing every possible lead. Thank you.
QUESTION: (INAUDIBLE) flight from Anchorage and then to Minneapolis and then to here?
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes, the individual flew from Alaska to Minneapolis to Fort Lauderdale on a Delta Airlines flight.
QUESTION: Why was he coming here?
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: At this time, it's still too early in the investigation for us to truly know why he came to Florida. So those are some of the things that we're looking at, his travel patterns, what brought him here, and his connections to south Florida.
QUESTION: (INAUDIBLE) Alaska. Were those agents (INAUDIBLE) was anything done to take those away from him?
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes. The individual did walk into our Anchorage office in November. He came in and spoke with FBI agents. At that time, he clearly stated that he did not intend to harm anyone. However, his erratic behavior concerned FBI agents that were interviewing him, and they contacted local police and turned him over to the local police.
He was taken into custody by the local police and transferred to a medical facility for a mental health evaluation. We looked at his contacts. We looked at -- we did our interagency checks and everything. And at that point, we closed our session.
QUESTION: (INAUDIBLE) Did you guys know that he had firearms on him?
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: That answer, I -- or that question, I really don't have the answers for. Again, it's very early in the investigation. We are working very closely with our Anchorage field office trying to determine his activities there. But I can't really tell you about his weapons there.
(CROSSTALK)
QUESTION: ... he voluntarily walked up to the FBI office in Anchorage?
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes, he voluntarily walked into our office, and he was interviewed by agents out of that office.
QUESTION: And how long was he in the mental health facility in Anchorage?
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: That information I don't have. Again, it's very early in the investigation. And that's something that we'll will have to determine with our Anchorage field office. He was turned over to local custody. And it was the local custody that took him to the medical hospital for evaluation.
(CROSSTALK)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Are you guys looking into how he (INAUDIBLE) in Anchorage right now?
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We're actually looking at several investigative leads not only in Alaska but in other states that we have determined that he's either traveled to or has connections there.
(CROSSTALK)
QUESTION: (INAUDIBLE)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'm not aware of any type of incident like that. But again, this is very early in the investigation, but at this point, we're unaware of an incident either on the flight or at baggage claim.
QUESTION: Is there any indication that he had become radicalized in any way? We know he mentioned some kind of hearing voices in his head (INAUDIBLE)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Again, it's very early in the investigation. As I mentioned, we're not ruling out anything. We're looking at every angle, including the terrorism angle. But it's going to take us some time to determine the true nature of the motivation of the individual.
QUESTION: (INAUDIBLE)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I believe he is 26 years old. He was in the U.S. military. We are currently reviewing his military records. I can tell you that he was in the military. I believe it was in the Army, but we haven't confirmed exactly his service.
QUESTION: What type of (INAUDIBLE) and how many shots fired?
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What I can tell you at this point is that it was a semi-auto handgun. But I'm not prepared to release the type of handgun, and it's way too early in the investigation to tell you how many rounds were fired.
QUESTION: Did he try to take hostages in the shooting?
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: No, he didn't try to take any hostages as the subject, Esteban Santiago, was shooting. He was, as I said, seconds after the shootings, contacted by a Broward sheriff's deputy. Instructions were rendered. He was taken into custody without incident and was immediately interviewed by the FBI and the Broward sheriff's office.
One more question.
QUESTION: Sheriff, did he make any statement while he was shooting that you're aware of?
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Not to my knowledge. (INAUDIBLE) will be getting into touch and letting you know when the next press release will be, press conference will be, when we're ready to release more information.
Right now, I just ask that the prayers of a nation be with the people and the families that lost loved ones in Broward County.
Thank you.
HANNITY: All right, that is a news conference of the Florida airport shooting from earlier today, of course. They said they did not rule out terrorism up to this point. Five were killed, eight others injured, and as they just said, we -- our thoughts and prayers go out to all of them.
Now, my ""Opening Monologue"" tonight on the Russian hacking is coming up in just a minute. But first, for the very latest on the shooter, we go to Jennifer Griffin. She's in D.C. tonight.
Jennifer, what do you have?
JENNIFER GRIFFIN, FOX CORRESPONDENT: Well, Sean, it's notable that federal law enforcement agents said that he had cooperated, the alleged shooter had cooperated, and they had conducted a long interview with him today.
Law enforcement sources who I spoke to tonight tell me that Private First Class Esteban Santiago Ruiz (ph) was investigated a few times for various infractions by various law enforcement agencies, at least twice, I'm told, by Army CID, the Criminal Investigative Division, and the FBI.
Santiago visited the FBI's Anchorage field office in November. That's what we just learned at the press conference. And he told agents that U.S. intelligence had infiltrated his mind and were forcing him to watch ISIS propaganda videos.
Santiago appeared agitated and incoherent during that interview, we're told, indicating that he was suffering from some kind of mental condition. He mentioned a deployment to Iraq. Santiago deployed to if from April 2010 to February 2011 as a combat engineer with the Puerto Rican National Guard. We've confirmed that with the Army.
After returning, he joined the Army reserves and then the Alaskan National Guard. But last August, he was discharged, I'm told, for poor performance. In November, as the FBI mentioned, they called local authorities, who took him to a local hospital for a mental health welfare check.
The FBI at that time opened an investigation, interviewed family members of Santiago, conducted database checks and an interagency review. These sources tell FOX that the FBI found no connections to any foreign terrorist organization at the time. Investigators are now scouring Santiago's electronic devices and digital history for traces of terrorist propaganda or any recent communications with known individuals.
We expect to learn a lot more about these multiple investigations that have taken place in the past in the coming days, Sean,
HANNITY: All right, Jennifer Griffin, thank you so much tonight, as always.
Joining us now with reaction to this very disturbing story, the author of this very important new book. It's called ""Iwar: War and Peace in the Information Age,"" Bill Gertz is with us. And also, the author of the best- selling book, ""Defeating Jihad,"" FOX News counterterrorism strategist Dr. Sebastian Gorka.
Dr. Gorka, when you hear these issues of mental health, and then he went in to the FBI and was incoherent, one has to always wonder, was there follow- up in a case like that if somebody is obviously that disturbed?
SEBASTIAN GORKA, FOX COUNTERTERRORISM STRATEGIST: Absolutely. This is the first question, Sean. So it's clear from the reports that FOX has already provided that this is an individual who repeatedly had issues either with the military or with local law enforcement or with the federal law enforcement. So this isn't the -- a case where somebody was a completely normal, upstanding citizen, and then suddenly cracked and then one day got violent.
Also, I would like to add one thing. There are already images, confirmed images on the internet, of this man wearing a Middle Eastern type scarf and making the classic jihadi hand signal, the raised one figure, which is symbolic of the Arabic word ""tocheed (ph)"" or unity. You see this in all the ISIS videos, al Qaeda videos.
The younger Tsarnaev brother responsible for the Boston bombing posted pictures of himself on the Internet making exactly the same symbol, because of course, Islam rejects the trinity and Allah is unitary.
So who knows. There are clearly, clearly signs that this man had issues, has problems, was a potential threat. And on top of that, there could be a jihadi angle, as well, Sean.
HANNITY: It's very scary. Just to switch topics because my ""Opening Monologue"" is coming up in the next segment, and Bill Gertz -- you talk about this in ""Iwar."" We really -- look, every single department, basically, in our government, including the White House, The State Department, the Department of Defense, NASA, every department, the IRS -- everything's been hacked, and this has gone on for all the years Obama's been in office. Wikileaks has been around for 10 years. And yet these politicians have done nothing.
So who are we really to blame here? Look, I've got this report in front of me, this -- I read it completely. (INAUDIBLE) there -- this whole intelligence report. And I read it, it's embarrassing because they know the methods and they're comparing it, reassess it based on past behavior. And my argument back is, Well, why haven't they done more to stop this?
BILL GERTZ, ""IWAR: WAR AND PEACE IN THE INFORMATION AGE"": Absolutely. Nothing's been done. We're faced with what I call an information warfare assault, and I think this latest report from the intelligence community confirms that.
The clear -- this was not about politics, this was about undermining the democratic system in the United States. It was a Russian-led intelligence operation involving both cyber and leaks and influence operations. And it was led and directed by Vladimir Putin, who views the United States as the main enemy of Russia.
HANNITY: Well, let me ask you -- I wish we had more time because this is so topic A in everybody's mind. What is the conclusion you come to because this is what the whole book is about?
GERTZ: Well, the conclusion is we're facing an information war and we're being disarmed in this battle, in this war. And we need to develop new methods, new institutions, new capabilities. We need clear thinking. We need clear strategy. And we need to counterattack. We need to go on the offensive against these enemy states that are waging information warfare against the United States.
HANNITY: Yes. Dr. Gorka, I assume you agree with that assessment. And the fact that we haven't done it tells you what?
GORKA: Look, Sean, I want to make it very clear to the viewers out there this isn't about cyber hacking. This isn't about Podesta's password being password. Bill is an old friend and he's absolutely right. This is influence operations. This is political warfare. This is a psychological operations.
Vladimir Putin is laughing that we have been completely unprotected, that he has (ph) accused the American electoral system of being somehow corruptible, when in fact, nothing happened in terms of stealing an election, but he sowed the seeds.
The fact that RT, the Russian television station, is the actor mentioned most often in this report tells you everything you want to know. This is influence operations, Sean.
HANNITY: Isn't there a bit of duplicity on the part of the President Obama, the Democratic Party, because the president even used State Department funds to actually fund an effort inside of Israel with his own political operatives on the ground in Israel to defeat Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in his most recent reelection? So isn't there -- you know, for all the talk about what an outrage, our president did it! Bill, I see you want to weigh in.
GERTZ: Yes, definitely. You know, I've covered the Obama administration since the earliest days. In the very early part of the Obama administration, when they were doing the so-called Russia reset, intelligence agencies and law enforcement agencies were prohibited from saying anything critical about Russia or Putin. And that went on for years and years and years.
And one of the things that came out in the intelligence report earlier was that this has been going on for more than 10 years, and nothing has been done about it. Hopefully, we'll get some action now and we'll take some steps to try and counteract these lies and disinformation.
HANNITY: Because the reality, Dr. Gorka, is we have to assume Russia and China and Iran and North Korea, friends and adversaries, are all hacking us. And by the way, we're probably hacking them. And if we are not, we're making a big mistake.
GORKA: On a double standards issue, Sean, to quote Chris Plante, my friend here in D.C., the radio host, if the left didn't have double standards, they wouldn't have any standards at all. The reality is, who's surprised? This is a KGB colonel! I mean, can somebody just wake up and smell the coffee grinds? Russia is attacking us every day, in all forms, whether it's economic, cyber of psychological operations. China is eating our lunch in the cyber domain! Bill knows this better than anybody.
So you're absolutely right. It's time to talk about the reality. And hopefully, January 20th is when the adults get back in control, and it's not going to be double standards or fantasyland anymore.
HANNITY: It's unbelievable. I want to thank you both for your insight tonight. Two very big stories that we continue to follow. And also tonight, the Obama administration did release its intelligence report on election hacking. And President-elect Donald Trump -- he's calling out the charade for what it really is, and that's a political witch hunt. And that's tonight's ""Opening Monologue.""
So the of the office of the director of national intelligence earlier today released a declassified version of its report on election hacking, and of course, Russia intentions. Now, it concludes that Vladimir Putin ordered an effort to try and damage Hillary Clinton all in an attempt to influence the election.
However -- now, this is key -- the report found no evidence that actual votes were tampered with, and it did not assess that there was an impact on the outcome of the election.
Now, President-elect Trump -- he was briefed on the classified version of the report earlier today, and afterwards, he put out a statement saying that his meeting with intel officials was constructive. And he added, quote, ""There was absolutely no effect on the outcome of the election, including the fact that there was no tampering whatsoever with the voting machines.""
Now, the president-elect is also saying tonight that unlike President Obama, he will actually do something to fix this problem by appointing a team to come up with a plan to fight and to stop future cyber attacks.
Now, Vice President-elect Mike Pence -- he elaborated on this plan. This is earlier tonight. Let's take a look.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
GOV. MIKE PENCE (R-IN), VICE PRES.-ELECT: The president-elect has made it very clear that were going to take aggressive action in the early days of our new administration to combat cyber attacks and protect the security of the American people from this type of intrusion in the future.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
HANNITY: Now, also earlier today, before his briefing, President-elect Trump -- he called out Democrats for trying to undermine his presidency by telling The New York Times, quote, ""China relatively recently -- they hacked over 20 million government names. How come nobody talks about that? This is a political witch hunt.""
Now, Mr. Trump, by the way, is highlighting how for the past eight years, President Obama has all but ignored cybersecurity threats. Quote, ""With all that being said, I don't want countries to be hacking our country. They've hacked the White House. They've hacked Coast Guard. We're, like, the hacking capital of the world.""
Now, President-elect Trump -- he's absolutely right. And as we told you about this last night, the president, the Democrats -- they've been asleep at the wheel when it comes to cyber security!
Now, take a look at the countless major cybersecurity attacks on the federal government that has all happened since 2009 when Obama became president.
And there's much more. The Democrats are pumping up this intel report as the smoking gun that proves Russian interference in this selection was a big reason why Donald Trump won. But what the left, and of course, the corrupt alt-left liberal media won't tell you about the report and what's in it -- it contains evidence about Russia trying to meddle in U.S. elections going all the way back to 2008!
And that's not all. NBC News is reporting that the classified version shows that Russian hackers -- they targeted the White House, the State Department, the Joint Chiefs of Staff and American companies!
So why all of a sudden out of nowhere -- this has been going on the entire Obama presidency -- is hacking now such a pressing issue? This once again just proves that the only reason President Obama and the Democrats care now about cybersecurity is because they need an excuse to explain why Hillary Clinton lost.
Now, the sore losers, snowflakes, left wing -- they can whine all they want, but the truth is they can only blame themselves and their gross negligence on cybersecurity for this election hacking.
Now, take a look at Hillary Clinton's campaign chairman. You see him there, John Podesta? Now, the reason his e-mails were accessed was because of a typo in a reply from a campaign IT staffer about a phishing e-mail that Podesta received. He gave them the information.
Now, Wikileaks founder Julian Assange -- he told me earlier this week that security from Podesta's e-mail was so laughably inadequate that a 14-year- old could have hacked into it.
And then, of course, there's Hillary Clinton. Remember her private e-mail server that they didn't want to talk about? Remember that was stored in a mom and pop shop bathroom closet? Does that sound secure to you? Of course not. Now, Clinton's setup was so careless that the FBI is 99 percent sure that up to five foreign intelligence agencies accessed it.
And then you have the DNC. Remember? FOX News learned that after the political party was hacked, they didn't give the FBI direct access to its servers and its data! So the FBI was forced to rely on a third party to try and figure out what happened. And The New York Times has reported that when the FBI first called DNC staffers to alert them of a possible cyber attack, they thought it was a prank call. They did nothing! And when the FBI kept calling and calling and calling for weeks following, well, the DNC continued to fail to act and address the problem.
So did the Democrats who are now feigning selective moral outrage here. If you would have just done your job and fixed the hacking problem that you knew about back in 2008 and '09, right in front of your face for years, this never would have happened!
Here with reaction, former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani. Mr. Mayor, I think this is important. Part of your company -- you deal with this issue on a daily basis. To me, this is a real clear and present danger that we have ignored for over 10 years. Am I wrong about that?
RUDY GIULIANI (R), FMR. NEW YORK CITY MAYOR: Absolutely right. Absolutely right, Sean. I don't even feel like I told you so. Thirteen years ago, I began warning about hacking with my law firm, Greenberg Traurig, and my technology and selfware (ph) partners, Blackberry. I have been involved for many years in trying to warn corporate officials, individuals, government agencies about the hacking that's been going on.
And the reality is, you need both a technological software solution like Blackberry provides and others do. You need legal solutions. And we haven't paid -- we haven't paid attention to it.
And I've been blue in the face giving speeches over this. Must have given at least 300 speeches over how American corporations and the American government is not paying attention to what is now ubiquitous hacking that's going on not just by Russia, not just by China, not just by North Korea, by our friends and also for commercial purpose, also for ransom. There have been hospitals that have been hacked and have had to pay money so that the whole hospital wasn't turned down (ph).
The amount of hacking that goes on is incredible. It's the fastest-growing form of crime. And if we need anything else to wake us up, the danger to our grid is there.
HANNITY: Well, it's interesting you say that...
GIULIANI: Both the head of the FBI and the head of Homeland Security would tell you that.
HANNITY: Mr. Mayor, since Obama has been president -- and I mentioned the 2008 election, which this report references, that they tried to influence that election -- and of course, Obama tried to influence the Israeli election. So that makes him a hypocrite.
But putting that aside, let me give you the list. The U.S. electric grid since 2009 has been hacked. Then we have the Pentagon's Joint Strike Fighter project -- that's been hacked. NASA's been hacked. The Department of Energy's been hacked. The Federal Election Commission network's hacked. The U.S. Postal Service hacked. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric administration has been hacked. The White House has been hacked. The State Department has been hacked. The Department of Defense has been hacked. The IRS has been hacked.
And in 2014, the Office of Personnel Management, 22 million people had their personal information hacked, and Obama never said a word, didn't kick out any diplomats, no sanctions. Not a peep!
What does that tell you?
GIULIANI: What that tells us is gross negligence on the part of the government with regard to a clear and present danger that we should have known about going back to 2003, 2004. And the hacking now is enormous. I believe it's the head of the FBI that said that American corporations are in two categories, those that have been hacked and know about it and those that have been hacked and don't know about it yet.
Some of these hackings, by the way, went on for a year or two or three years before they were caught because the companies involved and the government agencies involved didn't bring in the experts, the software experts, the analytical experts...
HANNITY: Well, let me ask this...
GIULIANI: ... at a fast enough pace.
HANNITY: So the reason they didn't care about all the hacking all the years prior, is it be because, well, these e-mails of the DNC and John Podesta showed racism, sexism, homophobia, anti-Semitism. And then we have, of course, the media colluding with the Clinton campaign. Then we have Clinton corruption that was exposed and all the money they made. And then we found out, you know, that they totally rigged the DNC process in favor of Hillary over Bernie. So that seems to be what has garnered their attention here.
GIULIANI: Well, that's really the point of this -- of this report, Sean.
HANNITY: It's political!
GIULIANI: The point is this. Yes. That report shows the election was not hacked. No vote was changed. If, in fact, what the Russians, if they did it, or whoever did it -- if the Russians or anyone else had hacked information that was perfectly neutral and did not show some terrible acts, said some terrible things, suggested some terrible actions taken by people, there'd be no problem here. It's their actions that caused whatever problem was caused. And as far as we can tell, really didn't have much of an impact on the vote.
HANNITY: Yes.
(CROSSTALK)
GIULIANI: They got -- they got -- they got caught saying what they were actually saying!
HANNITY: You know, it's interesting because there's a high level of confidence in certain intelligence agencies and only a moderate at the NSA. So their disagreement among themselves...
I have to break, Mr. Mayor. What you are warning here is so important. And if we don't...
GIULIANI: Please, listen!
HANNITY: ... from these examples...
GIULIANI: I've been trying for 13 years. Let's do something about hacking, and American corporations play a big role in this. They don't do enough about it.
HANNITY: Well said. Mr. Mayor, you've been making this cry for years. I've talked about it many times. Thank you for warning us once again. We appreciate it.
GIULIANI: Thank you.
HANNITY: Now, we have to assume that Iran and North Korea and China and, yes, Vladimir Putin in Russia are our enemies! We've know they've been doing this for decades.
Coming up, we'll have more reaction to the declassified Russian hacking report.
But also, coming up next -- that's first here...
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
KELLYANNE CONWAY, TRUMP SENIOR COUNSELOR: Vladimir Putin did not tell Hillary Clinton to ignore Macomb County, Michigan and Wisconsin and to rest on her laurels in Pennsylvania.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
HANNITY: Mike Huckabee, Larry Elder -- they're here next to react to Kellyanne Conway's comments. That and more tonight on this busy Friday news night here on ""Hannity.""
SEAN HANNITY, FOX NEWS HOST: Welcome back to HANNITY. So despite the left trying to use the Russian hacking as an excuse to explain away Hillary Clinton's embarrassing election loss and delegitimize Donald Trump's presidency, well, the facts tell a very different truth. Take a look.
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
KELLYANNE CONWAY, TRUMP CAMPAIGN MANAGER: You've got many people on TV trying to confuse the voters and the viewers by conflating any alleged Russian hacking with the election results. And you simply can't show the nexus. Vladimir Putin did not tell Hillary Clinton to ignore Macomb County, Michigan, and Wisconsin and to rest on her laurels in Pennsylvania.
REP. PAUL RYAN, (R) SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES: There are attempts on the left to try and delegitimize this election. That's just bogus. He won, fair and square. He won clearly and convincingly. Russia didn't tell Hillary not to go to Wisconsin or Michigan. They didn't put the server in her basement or put the stuff on Anthony Weiner's laptop. He won the election fair and square, fairly and convincingly, OK?
(END VIDEO CLIP)
HANNITY: Here now with reaction is former 2016 GOP presidential candidate Governor Mike Huckabee and nationally syndicated Salem radio talk show host Larry Elder. Governor Huckabee, I don't know if you are still in Israel. I know you were there this week, and our president tried to influence the election against Prime Minister Netanyahu.
MIKE HUCKABEE, (R) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Sean, I'm waiting on the Senate to get us exercised about the way that we involved ourselves as a U.S. government in the Israeli election like they think something happened in Russia. And $350,000 tax dollars from the State Department was sent to a group called One Voice. It was used for voter list and databases, and all of it was intended to get rid of Benjamin Netanyahu. Then Obama's people, including Jeremy Bird, helped to raise millions of dollars in 2015 in order to defeat Benjamin Netanyahu in a foreign election. I want to know where is the Senate outrage about that? That's not allegations. That's not declassified. That's information that even a Senate bipartisan committee had to accept.
HANNITY: Larry, there is another component to that is taxpayer dollars were used there, $350,000. That may not sound like a lot, but that's money from hard-working Americans that this president used to influence on elections against, I might add, our closest allies.
LARRY ELDER, SALEM RADIO NATIONAL SYNDICATED HOST: Right. And we also found out because of Project Veritas that Democratic operatives were literally sending agitators to interfere with Donald Trump rallies and sending people to various states who could not vote there legally. So there's a whole lot of shenanigans going on that apparently they are not concerned about. The bottom line is Donald Trump stomped them, they still can't believe this vulgarian person --
(LAUGHTER)
HANNITY: He's watching. He's going to get mad that you called him a vulgarian. What does that mean? Come on.
ELDER: That's what they think of him. That's what people like even Mitt Romney said about the guy. They cannot believe that this man won, and they're looking for any kind of excuse they can put their hands around.
HANNITY: Governor Huckabee is laughing. Governor, I just will say this. All these instances that I went over with former mayor Rudy Giuliani, this has been out there, this has been happening. And we haven't heard a peep. And even worse than that, they've done nothing to fix it. This is something that ought to be our national security priority right now in my opinion.
HUCKABEE: It really should. I had dinner last night in Israel, I am back in the states now, but with two Israeli generals, two colonels, and a Mossad agent who has just retired. The interesting thing, one of the generals was a major player in Israeli cyber security and said the United States doesn't take this as seriously as they need to. And it's one of the most I think important ways in which we are going to be fighting a war in the future. And we haven't made it a priority. It's high time we do, I hope we do and I hope Donald Trump will.
HANNITY: Last word, Larry.
ELDER: Regarding the content on the DNC emails, the content of John Podesta's emails, I'm old enough to remember, Sean, ""Candid Camera."" The creator of it said he had an expression called caught in the act of beating themselves. Putin didn't write those emails, they were caught in the act of being themselves.
HANNITY: Well said, very well said. It was one of my favorite show, with ""The Honeymooners,"" All in the Family,"" but that is for another day. Good to see you guys, thank you.
And up next tonight on this busy news night here on HANNITY.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
DONALD TRUMP, (R) PRESIDENT-ELECT: The country of Mexico will be reimbursing the United States for the full cost of such a wall, OK?
(END VIDEO CLIP)
HANNITY: President-elect Trump, he promised he would build a wall along the southern border, Mexico would pay for it. Now he's lashing out the mainstream media for trying to distort his plan. We will check in with Bo Dietl, Geraldo Rivera, they're next straight ahead.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
TRUMP: End illegal immigration act.
(APPLAUSE)
TRUMP: Fully funds the construction of a wall on our southern border. Don't worry about it. Remember, I said Mexico is paying for the wall. With the full understanding that the country of Mexico will be reimbursing the United States cost of such a wall. We have a trade deficit with Mexico of $58 billion a year. The wall is going to cost $10 billion. You tell me I can't make that deal? That's an easy deal.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
HANNITY: That was president elect Donald Trump during the campaign not only promising to build a border wall with Mexico but explaining how he would make them pay for it. Now, over the past 24 hours the leftwing alt left mainstream media was having a field day over reports suggesting that Donald Trump was backtracking to make Mexico paid the bill. The president- elect shot back with a tweet saying ""The dishonest media does not report that any money spent on building the wall,"" the great wall he calls it, ""for the sake of speed will be paid back by Mexico later.""
Here with reaction, New York City democratic mayoral candidate Bo Dietl, the first Democrat I am going to support.
GERALDO RIVERA, FOX NEWS SENIOR CORRESPONDENT: Me, too.
HANNITY: And FOX News senior correspondent Geraldo Rivera. Geraldo, you know I did many town halls with president-elect Trump. I asked him specifically, I said, you don't expect Mexico to write you a check to build a wall, do you? He said of course not. And he explained it just as he did today and just as he did on the camping campaign time and time again that through the different deals that will be moving forward it will more than pay for the wall. The media is dishonest and lying by characterizing the way they are.
GERALDO RIVERA, FOX NEWS SENIOR CORRESPONDENT: All that may be true, but there is no doubt that the wall, they figure it's about ten bucks per mile? It's $20 billion to build the wall. So if the United States, and I have said this, I have not been a fan of the wall. I think it's an idea that will not work. But if you want to build a wall, if you want to spend valuable infrastructure dollars to build the wall, then you can build it under this 2006 appropriations bill that approves 700 miles. The Democrats can stop the whole process by saying we're going to shut down the government unless you take that out of the spending bill..
BO DIETL, FORMER NYPD DETECTIVE: The Bill was approved back in 2006. There is legislation that is there already. And I do understand what my President Trump is speaking about. They will eventually pay for the wall.
RIVERA: How are they going to pay for it?
HANNITY: I can answer that. Remember when he met with the Mexican president they talked about reconfiguring NAFTA, number one. Number two, hang on, look at all the different companies. Ford is pulling out their plant. Donald Trump now putting pressure on Toyota to pull their plant out. That's all money that is coming back to the U.S.
DIETL: Donald said they're not going to pay directly, but indirectly they are going to pay for the wall.
HANNITY: Indirectly.
RIVERA: There were 15,000 automaker jobs on the south of the border that now are not going there because Ford is keeping its plant here. GM is going to keep some of that production here. What are those 15,000 Mexicans going to do? They live right on the other side of the border. Do you think they are going to stay there and stay hungry or are they going to try to sneak in?
DIETL: Geraldo, Geraldo, first of all, when I become mayor of New York City and you're a criminal, you're an illegal here, bye-bye. I need a wall once I throw them out to keep him out, OK? I need the wall to be built.
RIVERA: Are you saying that as mayor you would end our sanctuary cities --
DIETL: For criminal. For criminals who are illegally here, bye-bye. I'm not paying for --
RIVERA: What about --
DIETL: I have no problem with that. I've got no problem. I'm looking at the criminal element. I want them out of this city, OK?
RIVERA: I think that a wall is huge distraction. Donald Trump has the hacking scandal and everything else makes clear the attack in Fort Lauderdale today at the airport, there are big fish to fry. If you want to distract the American people with a debate over spending over the wall -
HANNITY: That wall will be built.
DIETL: And it will be paid for by Mexico.
HANNITY: But I've been down to the wall. I've been there on horseback, helicopter, boat, all-terrain vehicle. I've been there when criminals were arrested, Geraldo. I've been in drug warehouses bigger than any warehouse you've seen, floor to ceiling drugs. We've got to build a wall.
RIVERA: Having the auto plants in Mexico is a better deterrent to keeping those people in Mexico that the wall is.
HANNITY: The wall will keep them out.
RIVERA: You take away their jobs and you build a wall?
DIETL: The wall is an expression. They have tunnels too. There are technologies we have to use like Israel uses and that's part of it, knocking out those tunnels that go for miles.
RIVERA: Israel is this big. You're talking about 2,000 miles.
DIETL: Whatever we've got to do, we've got to do. We've got to keep these criminals out of here.
HANNITY: Maybe people can work that are out of work, the 95 million Americans under the Obama economy, the 13 million on food stamps, maybe that's a good jobs program.
RIVERA: I like that, building a wall.
HANNITY: Building the wall.
RIVERA: Why not repairing broken down bridges? Why not building tunnels? Why not highways? Why not sidewalks? Why not schools?
TRUMP: Geraldo, this is a new beginning. Face it, Donald Trump is our president.
HANNITY: I've got to go. But you don't want ISIS crossing that one day.
RIVERA: Which beard do you like better?
HANNITY: By the way, the mustache thing at the end.
(LAUGHTER)
DIETL: Why do you have a black beard? What the hell is the black beard about?
(LAUGHTER)
HANNITY: Up next on HANNITY, straight ahead.

JOE BIDEN, (D) VICE PRESIDENT: Grow up, Donald. Grow up. Time to be an adult. You're president.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
HANNITY: By the way, you've never had fun until you've had beers with these two. Vice President Joe Biden at it again. Frank Luntz, Deneen Borelli, they'll weigh in on that straight ahead.
HANNITY: Welcome back to HANNITY. So there are just two weeks left until the end of the Obama administration, two weeks from today. Bye-bye. Now, the Democrats are not going away quietly. Earlier today after a joint session certified the Electoral College results, vice president crazy uncle Biden, he couldn't let the moment go by without a snide remark. It was caught on an open mic. Listen to the end of this clip.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
BIDEN: Dissolved.
(APPLAUSE)
BIDEN: God save the queen.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
HANNITY: ""God save the queen,"" really? And that's not all. During an interview yesterday with PBS, crazy uncle Joe had this message for the president-elect. Take a look.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
BIDEN: Grow up, Donald, grow up. Time to be an adult. You're president. You've got to do something. Show us what you have. You're going to propose legislation. We are going to get to debate it. Let the public decide. Let them vote in Congress. Let's see what happens.

HANNITY: Joining us now with reaction, pollster Frank Luntz, FOX News contributor Deneen Borelli. You too with the beard? What's up with the beard today? At least you don't have the little twirlly thing like Geraldo. Frank gets upset, like if I write a little nasty little text of snide remarks, you don't like it. You don't like the discourse in the country right now.
FRANK LUNTZ, POLLSTER: No, I don't.
HANNITY: But that's Joe Biden and who he is.
LUNTZ: But that's the point. Could you imagine Ronald Reagan telling a successor to grow up? Could you imagine this coming from Franklin Roosevelt or Dwight Eisenhower, or even John F. Kennedy? This is not language that is befitting a vice president.
HANNITY: Was John F. Kennedy's behavior with women befitting for the office?
LUNTZ: No, but these are not things that he said in public.
HANNITY: Do it privately and be a hypocrite. If you do it privately it's OK?
LUNTZ: No, it's not good publicly. It's not good privately. Sean, let's not excuse it. If anyone says or anyone does it, we all agree that we want our kids to inherit a nation that is safer, more secure, and more civil. We want our children to respect each other and treat each other with dignity. That's a good society and that is not what's happening right now when Joe Biden is contributing to that. It's not befitting of him. I'm surprised he did it.
HANNITY: The low rated liberal morning show on that no-name network, OK, so he takes a shot at me today. And I talk about his low ratings and how he has been begging for a job at FOX for years. I am not going to take that from that little twerp. So I was not exactly civil.
DENEEN BORELLI, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: And it's OK because you can do what you want to do.
HANNITY: But getting so sensitive, I don't get offended by what anybody says about me.
BORELLI: Snowflakes, right?
HANNITY: The snowflake syndrome.
BORELLI: Regarding the left, though, they are still mad because they lost the election. The actions of the left speaks volumes, really, from the recount effort which failed to complaining about Donald Trump tweeting.
HANNITY: I don't get mad at anybody, anything they say about me. I have read your book and the things said about you, that made me angry. I get more angry about my friends than I do about what they say about me.
BORELLI: The left doesn't want our message to get out. Our message is liberty and personal responsibility. The left is all about control as well, you have to keep that in mind. They can't control Donald Trump. They can't control our conservative message.
HANNITY: Frank, we always said we don't like negative advertising, we don't like combative language, but the reality is negative ads work, combat works. So we really do like it, don't we?
LUNTZ: We like accountability. And we like -- for example we want Washington to be more efficient, more effective, and more accountable. And we want our politicians, one of the highest tested lines of all the debates was when Donald Trump said that he was going to investigate Hillary Clinton. Politics and partisanship aside, the public said yes, finally, politicians holding themselves accountable.
HANNITY: My favorite line was when he said ""Now you are going to use honest Abe to tell a lie?""
We need your help. Our question of the day is next. Thanks, guys.
HANNITY: Time for our ""Question of the Day."" What do you think about the Russian hacking intelligence report? Like, really, all this happened for 10 years and you did nothing? Go to Facebook.com/SeanHannity, @SeanHannity on Twitter, let us know what you think.
That is all the time we have left. I hope you have a great weekend. In two weeks, Obama, gone. Goodbye. Have a good retirement. We'll see you back here on Monday. Have a great weekend."
0	8	 9 von 72	Fox News Network	January 6, 2017 Friday	 THE KELLY FILE	 9:00 PM EST		"MEGYN KELLY, FOX NEWS HOST: Breaking tonight, we are waiting an FBI news conference on the shooting that unfolded at one U.S. airport this afternoon. As travelers were confronted by a deranged gunman with military training.
Welcome to THE KELLY FILE, everyone, I am Megyn Kelly. The panic in Fort Lauderdale, Florida lasted for hours after a 26 year old suspect who we are not naming for our KELLY FILE policy started methodically shooting passengers in the baggage claim area of the airport. But despite the suspect being quickly arrested, millions of Americans were watching in horror as my colleague Shepard Smith was interviewing one man on the scene and reports of a second shooting started to break.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
JOHN SCHILCHER, SAW SHOOTER AT AIRPORT: I think once everyone realized what was happening, and for myself, had to wait and it was surreal. As I said I looked over and when I saw blood just fooling underneath people, I realized that it was real and people were being shot. It was just oddly quiet after it happened. There wasn't screaming and I think when people started realizing that it was safe, I think that that was when people started sobbing and crying and it's just, it's an unbelievable feeling. The emotions and everything. (INAUDIBLE) I don't know what is happening. 
SHEPARD SMITH, FOX NEWS HOST: John, anything where you can remember specifically about this suspect?
SCHILCHER: Uhm.
SMITH: John?
SCHILCHER: There have been reports that shots were fired in the garage, and they are walking us down again. They said that they think somebody is in a garage right now. They just said a second shooting. We are being told to get on the floor -- everybody get on the floor. Get down. They told everyone to get down. Oh. Oh, God! Everybody is laying down on the floor between the carousel.
SMITH: John, how are you and your wife?
SCHILCHER: We are in shock still. And this doesn't help. We thought the scene was secured. People were crying out. People are scared to death.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
KELLY: Wow. Thankfully, that second incident was a false alarm. But with five killed and eight more wounded at an airport that sees upwards of 75,000 travelers a day, it took several hours before the tension calm down a bit.
In moments, correspondents Phil Keating has the story from some horrified witnesses tonight, before we asked Congressman Peter King about this story, he is the chairman of the House Subcommittee on Counter Intelligence -- and Counterterror and Intelligence.
But we begin tonight with Trace Gallagher who is live with the breaking news desk. Trace.
TRACE GALLAGHER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Megyn, earlier reports from Florida official saying the alleged shooter flew to the U.S. from Canada where inaccurate. FOX News has now confirmed the man took a Delta flight from Anchorage, Alaska, stopped in Minneapolis and then on to Fort Lauderdale. Alaska police say, the suspect arrived for his flight for hours early and checked only the case that carried his handgun. Authorities say it's common to check weapons in Alaska, considering it is a big hunting destination.
County officials say when the gunmen arrived in Florida, he grabbed the gun case, loaded the weapon in the bathroom and began shooting. After reloading and firing two more times, the suspect finally gave up without police firing a shot. But at the sound of the gun shop, some passengers took cover. Most fled to toward the front and rear of the airport into the streets and onto the tarmac.
Incoming flights were allowed to land but the airport soon shut down and 90 minutes after the shooting, just as the panic began to subside, there were two more reports of shots fired. Both turned out to be false. But there was video of what appeared to be another man being arrested. Here is police.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: To my knowledge, no one was taken into custody. People could have been secured in handcuffs until we find out who they were, what they were and how they were related or not related to this scenario.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
GALLAGHER: Outgoing passengers remained in the airport, incoming passengers were escorted away. We now know the alleged shooter was born in New Jersey and grew up in Puerto Rico. He served with the Puerto Rico National Guard and the Alaskan National Guard. After returning from a tour in Iraq, his brother says, he was changed. And law enforcement sources tell FOX news that in November of last year, the suspect visited the FBI office in Anchorage telling field agents that U.S. intelligence had infiltrated his mind and were forcing him to watch ISIS propaganda videos.
After an investigation, the FBI concluded the man had no connection to foreign terror organizations. Investigators are now scouring the gunman's electronic devices and digital footprint for any trace of terrorist propaganda or communication and it remains unclear if the shooter is cooperating at this hour -- Megyn.
KELLY: Trace Gallagher, thank you.
Next up, we check in with someone who's been on the scene all day, talking with witnesses and gathering the latest information for us. FOX News Phil Keating is live in Fort Lauderdale for us tonight. Phil?
PHIL KEATING, FOX NEWS NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Megyn, after the initial two hours of terror and absolute pandemonium here at the airport, that is when authorities locked this airport down. Nobody was allowed to come into the airport property, nobody was allowed to leave. And then everybody was evacuated from terminal one, everybody who had already gone through security at the gates behind me in terminal two above where the baggage claim area is, where the carnage went down. Thirteen shot. Eight wounded. And of course five dead.
There was a six hour lockdown. Nobody could go the bathroom. No one could drink water and there were several planes out on the tarmac, including this united planes over here to the right. Camera right. That were full of passengers that were coming into the airport. Because after the initial shooting, in the baggage claim area, operations started to pick back up and flights were coming in and out and then there was that as Trace reported, second false scare attack when people thought they heard gunshots in the garage and in terminal one.
The sheriff says, those were not actual gunshots. But according to witnesses, the gunmen, after he shot and emptied his gun the first time, reloaded and shot some more, he stopped and then he was approached by a law enforcement. Broward County Sheriff's Deputy seek the property, they ordered him to surrender. And he did. And he has been in custody ever since surely after 1:00. The passengers are finally being allowed to leave the property and go, we spoke with some who were here at the airport at the early stages here and they said it was sheer terror.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We heard a pop, pop, pop. And then a crowd of people came running around the corner and actually my daughter had her baby in a carrier thing. Like a backpack and she got trampled. My husband helped her get up and just said run, run. So, both guys run. So, I have -- there are 19 of us here, and we are all in three different areas.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: They were terrified, the families specifically.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The ones that were here with their kids.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes. They were all like -- the kids were definitely like, in their parents arms.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes. I thought I saw people -- a lot that are hyperventilating, they were so scared.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: There were some people that looked like they were having an anxiety attack.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
KEATING: Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport remains completely close to operations and air traffic, nothing coming in, nothing going out. It's going to be that way all night long. So, the first flights will be happening sometime here. Tomorrow, everybody who is stranded here who was trying to get out of Fort Lauderdale and go home, they are now trying to make additional travel arrangements and trying to find hotels for tonight -- Megyn.
KELLY: Phil Keating, thank you.
Joining me now, New York Republican Congressman Peter King, chairman of the House Subcommittee on Counterterrorism and Intelligence. Great to see you sir tonight.
REP. PETER KING (R-NY), CHAIRMAN, COUNTERTERRORISM AND INTELLIGENCE SUBCOMMITTEE: Thank you, Megyn.
KELLY: Thank you for being with us. So, first of all, the suspect tonight is in custody. What do we know about how that procedure is going to go forward?
KING: Well, my understanding is, you know, as you would notice, this is obviously entitled to a lawyer. I would hope the interrogation has started if he's not asked for lawyer. He's been advised in terms of time. But Megyn, I think, you know, the large issue here to me is that he did turn himself in. Or he walked in, said that he was hearing voices telling him to --
KELLY: In November 2016, he went into an FBI agent and said that he was hearing US Intel agents telling him to watch ISIS videos.
KING: Right. And I don't think we can, I mean, just look upon this as crazy people who are acting this way. The fact is, ISIS more than any other terrorist group has found a way to communicate with these people on the fringes of society. The person in New York who attacked two police officers with a hatchet. There are others like that. So, this is almost a part of the ISIS army.
KELLY: How so? Like, how?
KING: They are skilled. And use of the internet. That their message, more so than al-Qaeda. More so than other terrorist groups is able to appeal to those people on the mental edge of society. And there's been a number of cases like that where it's not the trained terrorists -- not the person -- now he may turn out that he is trained, he is committed, but again, just the fact that he is again, that psychiatric treatment he was talking about joining ISIS. This is not just some crazy person. This is a person who that ISIS has been able to appeal to and I think --
KELLY: I don't know. We may be getting ahead of our skis on that, Congressman.
(CROSSTALK)
KING: No. No. I do know.
KELLY: We have one random statement the guy made. Who knows what else he may have said on the FBI --
KING: Exactly.
KELLY: This is a man who developed mental issues according to his family when he came back from Iraq five years ago.
KING: Right. Exactly.
KELLY: And hospitalized for a while. For mental illness.
KING: Right. Exactly.
KELLY: And so we see a developing problem culminating in.
KING: Right.
KELLY: I mean, you tell me because nine times out of 10, these shooters, because there is a distinction we have drawn in this country between these random shooters and terrorists.
KING: Right.
KELLY: Nine times out of 10, these shooters --
KING: Right.
KELLY: They are in their mid-20s --
KING: Right.
KELLY: And they tend to have mental health issues and they kick in, they tend to hear voices. This happens all the time. I'm not trying to exonerate ISIS, but I'm just saying.
KING: No, no, no. Megyn, I'm not saying, I should know anything about this guy. I'm saying that ISIS, the communications it has, is appealing to more mentally, unstable people. ISIS doesn't even know this guy existed I'm sure. But I'm saying that as a precaution. Whenever a person is dealing with mental illness and any talk of ISIS at all, there should be more surveillance of him. That's all I'm saying.
KELLY: What is the FBI's obligation in your view, when the guy walks in, you know, he's obviously a mentally disturbed man. I don't know if they look at a man like that and say oh, it's a terrorist. So much as this guy is crazy. I mean, do they have any obligations to seek to have him committed? To contact his family? To do anything like that?
KING: I think they should. And I think there should be surveillance for someone like this. You combine crazy, talking about ISIS, and you talk about a person who is a prospect to carry out an act of violence. Not because he's trained, not because he's exploiting terrorism. But that ISIS has put these ideas in people's head. And that's known. I mean, that's not something I'm making up but I'm saying. So that to me should have been an indicator. That's all.
KELLY: -- running this down tonight.
KING: Yes.
KELLY: You know, because it's not completely figured out.
KING: Right. Exactly.
KELLY: Necessarily. They have him. Hopefully he is talking. But if there was somebody else working with him, if this wasn't a lone actor, they will be looking into that. Have you heard anything about that? Is there any, you know, terrorism involved, officials involved in this? Are there?
KING: Oh, yes, I can assure you, all the kinds of terrorism people involved, the FBI, and they are scrubbing everything right now to find any possible terror contacts he might have including going through his, you know, computers, iPhones, everything else to find out any links they may have to terrorism. But the fact is that if there is anyone out there, believe me, the FBI is trying to get them. You know, assuming from the start, there is a terrorist link and you work your way back.
KELLY: Uh-hm.
KING: So, yes, they're definitely looking to see if there is anybody else involved. If there is more involved or there's just one individual.
KELLY: Uh-hm. Gosh, Congressman Peter King, good to see you, sir. Thank you for being here.
KING: Thank you, Megyn. Thank you.
KELLY: Well, within hours of this shooting, experts were warning about airports being riskier than ever. And Tony Shaffer and Brad Thor joins us next on what's becoming a major security concern? Wait until you see a list of terrorism incidents involving airports. We tonight have our hands on the official report as well into what the Russian were up to during the 2016 presidential election.
Marc Thiessen and Mo Elleithee are here on what this means for our next president.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENT-ELECT: I know a lot about hacking. And hacking is a very hard thing to prove. So, it could be somebody else. And I also know things that other people don't know. And so they cannot be sure of this situation.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
KELLY: Breaking tonight, we are waiting on an FBI news conference right now. Again, FBI at the scene of a horrific rampage this afternoon at Fort Lauderdale International Airport. Five people are dead tonight, eight more are injured. The deadly assault raises the same questions we have heard for more than a decade now about whether airport security needs a complete and total overhaul.
We have Lieutenant Colonel Tony Shaffer tonight along with Brad Thor on that. But first, Trace Gallagher reports on what we found when we reviewed recent incidents. Trace?
GALLAGHER: Megyn, multiple studies have shown it's not the scale of the attack or the size of the bomb. It's the proximity to a vulnerable group of people. Today shooting in Fort Lauderdale is another horrific reminder that public areas, and airports, remain highly attractive targets. In 2013, a gunman in Los Angeles International Airport walked into terminal three, pulled out an assault rifle and opened fire killing a TSA agent and wounding several travellers.
Last March inside the Brussels Airport, 16 people were killed when two suicide bombers struck 37 seconds apart. One targeted the outside of a security check point, the other blew up near an airline check-in counter. Then in June, three terrorists armed with bombs and guns attacked the main airport in Istanbul, Turkey. Killing 45, injuring 230. Those attacks also happened in unsecured public areas. In recent months, U.S. Homeland Secretary Jeh Johnson has pushed to limit the number of entries into airport terminals and increased the number of officers patrolling those entries.
But because of funding shortages, the policies have not been adopted. There's even talk of moving security checkpoints to the doorways of airport terminals, but critics call it a catch 22 remedy. Saying it would only push crowds into the sidewalks, the streets, and the parking areas where they would still be targets. The consensus appears to be focused on improving security and ticketing procedures. So that large crowds of people are not grouped together waiting in line. The idea behind the latest airport technology is to help reduce people standing around because a moving target is much more difficult to hit -- Megyn.
KELLY: Trace, thanks.
Joining me now with more, CIA trained Intel operative, Lieutenant Colonel Tony Shaffer and the bestselling author who shadowed a black ops team in Afghanistan, Brad Thor. Good to see you both.
So, Colonel Shaffer, let me start with you.
LT. COL. TONY SHAFFER (RET), U.S. ARMY RESERVE: Yes.
KELLY: Is there anything, any of the measures that are being considered to tighten airport security that would have stopped this guy?
SHAFFER: This is a tough one.
KELLY: Anytime you have one who has essentially, illegally, check weapon, where they take out in the baggage claim area, it's tough to do. I think we have to look though Megyn, how you would be able to spot and maybe prevent this from happening by the fact that maybe there should be a procedure for stopping this. I mean, you have to understand as Trace were just talking about, there are crowds in a lot of places. And airports, and train stations, public facilities. I just had a red team walked through a local, major landmark that has lot of people every day. So, you have got to actually examine every vector. This is a potential vector that has never been tried before but that is why you create red teams, you actually had red teams, to actually go through and think, if I were a bad guy, how would I do this? I did that very thing. There is a bad guy for this one local big building, so --
KELLY: But I mean, with all due respect on that. Brad, I'll give this one to you. This is a free and open society. And you know, even if you banned guns from going through, you know, the checked baggage, some do come in off the sidewalk as we just detailed in that Trace report.
BRAD THOR, NYT BESTSELLING AUTHOR: Right.
KELLY: And you tell me, we want to believe that there is some way of preventing in this society a madman from getting to us. But the truth is, it's not really possible.
THOR: No. Don't place negatives, it's never going to be a hundred percent safe. But what Tony was talking about, where doing the red teaming, that's a human factor. Okay? So, you're bringing human beings in to say, to role play and what would I do as a bad guy? The Israelis do this better than anybody else. And Jeh Johnson maybe pushing for more uniform officers which I think is great because I've just been around La Guardia and O'Hare and not seen one the entire time of checking in or getting my bags out.
KELLY: Yes.
THOR: But we need to need to start being able to walk up, profile people, ask them questions. And there need to be several times that passengers or people picking people up actually interface with security personnel and are asked questions. And Trace said earlier, this guy checked and maybe I heard it wrong but it sounded like the only thing this guy checked was his case with his gun in it.
KELLY: Yes.
THOR: That should have set off a whole bunch of red flags. That guys I should have never been allowed to get on to that airplane in Alaska without a whole hell of a lot of secondary screening and answering some questions. I don't want to take his gun away if he's an average everyday citizen, but that's weird. All the way to Florida with just a gun?
KELLY: Well, and here is the other question, Tony, Colonel --
SHAFFER: Yes.
KELLY: Why does the guy have the gun in the first place if in November, he walked into an FBI office and said, I'm hearing voices telling me to go watch ISIS videos?
SHAFFER: Right.
KELLY: And he had been hospitalized five years earlier. For mental health issues. So, it's like you've got the guy who has the mental health history, he goes into the FBI office a couple of months earlier, he travels with only the gun checked. You know, it may, I'm not saying you could have predicted it, but there were a couple of red flags here.
No. As you and Peter King were talking about, this guy was on the radar. And, you know, he was susceptible to suggestion. And I think he followed through his suggestion and -- didn't know about it but this kid took it on and did it. And your point is well taken. This guy had multiple intakes from mental issues and plus, he was an army or military reserve. I'm not sure what service.
KELLY: National Guard.
SHAFFER: The National Guard should have been tracking this kid and if there were issues, clearly there was a pattern. There should have been something and as Brad said, you know, hey, the kid is traveling with a weapon. Maybe there should have been a way of linking that together. And look, I am not for big brother.
KELLY: Right.
SHAFFER: I am not for --
(CROSSTALK)
But there is an issue here, when you do have multiple -- multiple events, not just one, multiple, and the kid is traveling with an unusual pattern with just a weapon. Those two things should have come together at some point.
KELLY: Uh-hm.
And as Brad said too. Just engage him. Just talk to him. Somebody should have walked up and said something, and nine times out of 10, there will be some sort of alerting behavior that says something is not right here.
KELLY: But it's resources, Brad, right? It cost money to have all these people like they have in Israel.
THOR: I am brokenhearted because I know this going to lead back to the VA, probably in Alaska and then people are going to say they didn't give him the care. It's going to be a tough thing for them. But listen, this is a 26 year old, primed for a psychotic break. Prime. And here's the thing. I agree with you.
KELLY: Yep.
THOR: ISIS may not have directed him to do this. But guess what? ISIS just saw something that works. So it is going to be open season on travelers and I hate that but this now shows this kind of thing works and if we don't get our acts together quick, we are going to see it happen again and again and again.
KELLY: So, given that because there's always the danger of copycats when something like this happens, what are people supposed to do? You've got to go through the system as it is currently established. You have to stand in the long line for security, you have to stand in line to get your bag especially let's say, you get away for two weeks, you got a family of five. You are not going to be able to carry all your luggage.
SHAFFER: Well, Megyn -- I'm sorry, go ahead Brad.
THOR: So, I was just going to say, real quick, you travel at the most off peak hours you can. You get a known traveller number so you zip through. You show up with your own boarding pass already printed out, and you do carry on. You move through that unsecured area as fast you can, and you only travel that way if you absolutely have to.
SHAFFER: And I went to -- recently. And Megyn, they actually have a system, channelization. So, you don't have people standing at big areas and if something goes off, God forbid. It's limited to a single area. And as Brad said, your best defender is yourself.
KELLY: Yes.
SHAFFER: Pick up and do what you can to keep your eyes, looking around, and look, your instincts, if you have that little -- sense in the back of your neck, your little -- that should be telling you to do so.
KELLY: Well, these are also, you know, the airports are gun free zones. So, you are there to defend yourself but nobody had a weapon there. They are considering changing that in a bill that is under consideration under Florida legislator. But most of people he was going up to, they were shot -- according to the eyewitness, there were elderly, you know, these weren't people who are in any position to defend themselves.
SHAFFER: Right. Well, Megyn --
KELLY: I got to leave it at that.
SHAFFER: I'm a formal federal officer, we should all be armed all the time.
KELLY: All right.
SHAFFER: Because we're capable.
KELLY: It's great to see you, guys. Thank you for being here.
THOR: Thanks.
SHAFFER: Thank you, Megyn.
KELLY: As we wait this FBI presser. Again, any moment now, we expect to hear from the officials down there on what their investigation has produced thus far, when it begins, we will bring it to you.
Plus, after weeks of speculation, we now have the intelligence community report on what the Russians did and did not do in the run up to our presidential election. Marc Thiessen and Mo Elleithee are next on that.
KELLY: Breaking tonight, we are waiting for an FBI news conference at Fort Lauderdale International, after a gunman killed five and injured eight others earlier this afternoon. We will continue watching it and we will get it to you just the moment it starts.
And we are also tracking new reaction tonight from President Obama and President-elect Donald Trump after they received separate highly classified briefings on the U.S. Intelligence report concluding that Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered his spy agency to interfere in America's 2016 election with the goal of helping Mr. Trump. Here is President Obama taking a hard line against his Russian counterpart earlier today.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
PRES. BARACK OBAMA (D), UNITED STATES: I think that what is true is that the Russians intended to meddle. We have to remind ourselves we're on the same team. Vladimir Putin is not on our team.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
KELLY: Hours ago, a declassified version of that same intelligence report was released to the public. Chief Intelligence correspondent Catherine Herridge is here with the details on that. Catherine?
CATHERINE HERRIDGE, FOX NEWS CHIEF INTELLIGENCE CORRESPONDENT: This report is very strongly worded. The conclusions, many of them are at the high confidence level. That is like getting a grade of A or A- it means that there is high quality intelligence from multiple sources to back up the finding. But it does not guarantee the information as fact. The report says the Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered the campaign in 2016. And it said over time, Putin and the Russian government developed a clear preference for Donald Trump. It does not save Putin direct day-to-day leaks or operations. More of WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange told Fox News earlier this week, the Russian government was not his source. For the DNC and Clinton Campaign emails, the report says otherwise. It reports that the Russian intelligence service provided the records and they chose WikiLeaks for its track record of credibility, there was no evidence the emails were altered. And even the Russian sought at a certain point, a Clinton (inaudible) was assured, quote when it appeared to Moscow that Secretary Clinton was likely to win the election, the Russian influence campaign began to focus more on undermining her future presidency. Without a strong response the repost say the Russians will do it again at it will get worst next time, Megyn.
KELLY: Catherine Herridge, thank you. just a short time ago Associated Press reporting that President-Elect Trump said he quote, ""learned a lot"" from the Intel in the briefing, but he reportedly declined to say whether he accepts Russia's role in our election. And then just moments ago on this channel, close Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway suggested that the Intel community has become politicized.
Former Michigan congressman Pete Hoekstra served as House Intel committee chairman and is a formal advisor to the Trump transition team. Good to see you tonight, congressman. This makes it pretty clear. Let me ask you whether you accept the conclusion of the 17 agencies that Russia did interfere with our presidential election and that it came at the direction of Vladimir Putin.
PETE HOEKSTRA, FORMER CONGRESSMAN: Well I think, let me make three points, Megyn. Number one it wasn't all 17 agencies. That is one of the things that hit you very, very quickly. It was only three of the agencies. DHS did not -- does not have its name on this report. The defense intelligence agency does not have its name on this report. It's only three agencies. The second thing is this is a structural problem in terms on how the intelligence community does its analysis. I found it interesting that Tony Shaffer was talking about red team. I think an intelligence analysis. You should always have a red team that provides a dissenting point of view. That is missing in this report and thirdly, if the report is five pages, about one page of that five pages talks about propaganda and it is based heavily on the reporting of RT television. That stands for Russian Television, so it's hard to get not understand that is propaganda. And if you've ever watched the programming of RT television, it's pretty much a joke. If the effort to influence our campaign that is what the intelligence community says is the best that Russia can do, in terms of propaganda, they've got a lot of improvement to do.
KELLY: Just to put a fine point on it, you don't believe them?
HOEKSTRA: No, I said, I don't believe.
KELLY: Everything you're saying is undermining the credibility of the reports. SO I am asking flat out with you, believing you accept it.
HOEKSTRA: Right. I am giving you a red team analysis, the fed says the report that came out today is not compelling, it is not compelling to me that as firmly as with this report points out that say yes, I believe there are certain parts of this that are true. But I think there are enough caveats here that you don't walk away and say wow they nailed this and they hit it out of the park. This analysis does not do it.
KELLY: Catherine Herridge says their opinions are we nailed it. They're A+ intelligence, but why? Why are they so confident?
HOEKSTRA: They claim it's A+ intelligence in their report, I haven't seen the classified data that says they really have or they really haven't. They claim that.
KELLY: Got it. Pete Hoekstra, thank you, sir. Joining me now with more, Marc Thiessen an American Enterprise Institute scholar and Mo Elleithee, founding executive director of Georgetown University Institute of Politics and Public Service, the longest title ever, well they are Fox News Contributor, get in shorten, he is from Georgetown, super smart. Why, just as a politics matter, why was he so, I mean if this has been a Democratic president and that something like this -- former congressman Pete Hoekstra do think would have gone on like he just did about why the need to doubt it?
MARC THIESSEN, AMERICAN ENTERPRISING SCHOLAR AND FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: I love Pete Hoekstra. I am not going to go after Pete Hoekstra.
KELLY: Well just explain what just happened there.
THIESSEN: What happens with the report like this, after the Iraq WMD fiasco, one of the things they didn't reforms in the intelligence community is they added this level of high confidence, middle confidence, low level confidence. The other thing they do in all presidential, intelligence analysis, if they add dissenting views, so if there are dissenting views in the intelligence community that was in the classified report. So if there is no dissent in the report, it's because no one dissented. So they should have included all of that information. But I think the point that Pete and the Trump people should be making which is absolutely true is that the issue here is not whether Russia tried to influence our election, they obviously did.
KELLY: They obviously did.
THIESSEN: The reports said they've been trying to do it since they were in the Soviet Union, they always trying to do.
KELLY: Are you really shocked by that?
THIESSEN: The question is not that they tried, the question is did they succeed? And the answer is absolutely not. They did not influence our election.
KELLY: How can they do that? WikiLeaks doesn't have any effects on anybody?
THIESSEN: Russia did not set up a private server in Hillary Clinton's basement and put classified information on it.
KELLY: She said the best stuff but they exposed it.
THIESSEN: Ok. If there is nothing to expose there would be nothing, personal that is not actually.
KELLY: Do you think Donald Trump did nothing at all and the Republicans that they are not seeing nothing? There is nothing to find there?
THIESSEN: What I'm saying is that I don't think this was the tipping point in the election in any way, shape, or form. Most of these stories that hurt Hillary Clinton were not broken by WikiLeaks in Russia. They were broken by the ""The New York Times.""
KELLY: The Podesta stuff. Doesn't this seem, this Intel committee report, conclude that Russia did fail to actually influence the election? They tried and even they apparently realized oh, we didn't make it.
MOE ELLEITHEE, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY INSTITUTE OF POLITICS: I think there are two different issues here. That too many people often times complain. Did they tamper with the actual election?
KELLY: No.
ELLEITHEE: There is nobody says that they did. Nobody said that they tampered with election machines. They didn't mess with Election Day. But did they influence the election itself? I'm not a Democrat who believes that what Russia did is why Hillary Clinton lost.
KELLY: Right.
ELLEITHEE: There are a lot of reasons why Hillary Clinton lost. But this is one of them. The DNC hack had nothing to do with Hillary Clinton's private server. The Podesta hack had nothing to do with Hillary Clinton's private server. They went in, they leak to this information.
KELLY: Let me take you back to the day, the weeks before the election, Mo, she was looking pretty good up until -- she went up and she went down. But the Jim Comey letter came out, the second one saying Anthony Weiner, once again has screwed things up and he got something we didn't see and her numbers started tanking, the Democrats freaked out and then she lost. So, I mean.
ELLEITHEE: That wasn't Russia.
KELLY: That is my point.
ELLEITHEE: Look there is a lot of read, here is the thing, for so long there was a steady drift of emails that were hack and leak through WikiLeaks.
KELLY: So you are just saying she should be a better person?
ELLEITHEE: But Donald Trump, look if Donald Trump said today they had no influenced over the election at all. But here's my question. Did they not Donald Trump every single day attack Hillary Clinton based on emails that were obtained from this Russian hack? Yes. If it wasn't influential, he wouldn't have used it.
THIESSEN: It wasn't just that. It was a minor part of the message. By the time those WikiLeaks emails came out, Americans already had concluded that Hillary Clinton was dishonest, large percentage that she was corrupt. KELLY: And we talked about on how they confirm previous leaks.
THIESSEN: That is exactly right. This wasn't fake news. This was real news.
KELLY: But Russia also did that.
THIESSEN: This was real news that Democrats did not want the American people wanted to see that Hillary Clinton (inaudible).
(CROSSTALK)
KELLY: It's disturbing to have Russia messing with our election. Get out of here.
ELLEITHEE: And this is what so frustrating to me. Os the President-Elect isn't showing that same level of frustration.
KELLY: He is trying to get along with Vladimir Putin.
ELLEITHEE: Democrats and Republican on the Hill are showing the same level of frustration and anger over this. Where is the President-Elect?
THIESSEN: If you will come out and say and Democrats will come out and say, we know this had nothing to do with the outcome of the election, this is not about discrediting Donald Trump. This is finding out what Russian did and stopping it. Every Republican will be on board with that, but that is not what the Democrats are saying. They're trying to use this to discredit Donald Trump.
(CROSSTALK)
And every Democrat will go ahead and say that I am on board.
KELLY: Well when they have accepted that he is the president, we will discuss that with Chris Stirewalt when he joins us later. It is official now they have accepted, great to see you both.
ELLEITHEE: Thanks.
THIESSEN: Thank you.
KELLY: Well, our producer at the Fort Lauderdale International Airport said that the feds could come to the microphone in any moment. We will listen when they do, they were a little late. They were going to have this well within the last hour, so far, nothing. Plus, Vice President Biden today had to shout down members of his own party when they objected to Donald Trump's win. It's happening, people. Chris Stirewalt is here on why that happened, next.
KELLY: Breaking tonight, our producer at the Fort Lauderdale Hollywood International Airport is now getting new details on exactly when this FBI news conference is set to start. Obviously, they were working hard in gathering information. We are keeping our eye on it for you and bring it to you when it happens. In the meantime, a battle is brewing on Capitol Hill after Republicans announced they will try to remove all federal funding for Planned Parenthood. The move comes as part of the process that they are using to repeal part of Obamacare.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Planned Parenthood legislation would be a reconciliation bill.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
KELLY: But already come up Democrats, planned parenthood, and allies are signaling a fight.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: What Speaker Ryan is trying to do here and what vice president incoming Vice President Mike Pence is trying to do is end and access to everything that would prevent unintended pregnancy in this country including family planning services. And that is a real irony here.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
KELLY: Joining me now is Dana Loesch, host of Dana on the Blade TV and Richard Fowler who is a National Syndicated Radio show host and a Fox news Contributor, great to see you both. So, Richard Let me start with you on exactly, they get some funds, they say it doesn't go for abortion services, the critics say money fungible. That is where the objection lies, so to deprive them of how much money, money for anything and everything, and could you know longer even get contraception there with the help of federal money?
RICHARD FOWLER, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR AND SENIOR FELLOW FOR THE NEW LEADERS COUNSEL: Here's what would happen. When they banned the funds, but they are sort of siding, it would stop Medicaid from being allowed to pay Planned Parenthood for the service there. For family planning, for breast cancer, for popsmears, for vasectomies, STI testing, and that is the side of Planned Parenthood that is funded by the federal government. Because of amendment, Planned Parenthood is not allowed to use federal money to do abortions, there are a couple of states where states money is allowed, 15 states to be precise, but there is not a nationwide thing where federal dollars are going to pay for abortions. That is actually illegal.
KELLY: The argument again is that money is fungible. It's what people don't like about their tax dollars going to Planned Parenthood.
FOWLER: I mean it is not quite fungible, because the president has to bill the federal government or Medicaid, for that particular expenditure. Let be very clear, once you closed on these clinics in a place like Texas for example. If you decide to defund Planned Parenthood, 27 percent of women in Texas will be without the health services they need to survive. That is a problem here, if you have problem with abortion that is one thing. But if you threaten a woman's health I think that is the distinction here.
KELLY: Dana?
DANA LOESCH, THE BLAZE ON TV AND AUTHOR OF ""HANDS OFF MY GUN: That is not entirely accurate. There is a little wiggle room there in the case of rape or incest, or threaten a woman's life. Secondly, I'm glad that Richard did mention Texas, some of the key states because Planned Parenthood actually was by the Department of Justice because they had overbilled Texas Medicaid. It was around $4 million. Here's the thing. Planned Parenthood is a for-profit business, Megyn. The last revenue count was about hundred $127 million. In 2015 Richards was forced to admit before congress that in fact, Planned Parenthood makes a lot of money off of abortion. And abortion accounts for 85 percent of their nongovernment revenue why in the world -- wait, Richard. Why are American taxpayers being forced to fund a for-profit business that gives 99 percent to Democrats? And here's the last point on this, Megyn I thought with the passage of Obamacare that we were all going to have health care. And to that birth control was going to be thrown out like Mardi Gras beads. So what happened with that?
FOWLER: I can explain both. Number one, under the affordable care act, it allows you to have health insurance. Let's be very clear, health insurance is in health care. You stop to find a provider. And a lot of places, Planned Parenthood, is the only provider these women's have.
KELLY: Let me ask you this question. Do you think President Trump, when he is in office, President Trump will accept this kind of rollback, because when he was having trouble with the women during the election, he came out and said Planned Parenthood does a lot of good things. They do a lot of good things and the Republicans were like, what? And then he is like, but I hate them. But they do a lot of good things. But they are terrible. I don't really know to be perfectly honest where he stands on it. Do you think Dana that President Trump will sign a bill for these changes?
LOESCH: I did actually remember being on your show and talking about the actual sound bite. He had said that he wants to make the Hyde amendment -- he wants to make Hyde permanent. Which I think is great. I think it would be great to do. And to Richards comment, community health centers outnumber Planned Parenthood 3-1 in every single state they offer a full swift of service. That actually outplayed Planned Parenthood.
(CROSSTALK)
FOWLER: It's not about wait, wait, wait. I just want to make a point here. I want to make the point, the point is yes, and they're not in the right places for them to get the health care. The other point I want to make it before we go there are shaky Republicans who might not vote for this reconciliation bill because of Planned Parenthood act. I could name three senators.
KELLY: You could almost hear when Ivanka was whispering in Trump's ear during the campaign. They do some good like the younger generation. Especially here in New York tends to feel that way, great to see you both.
FOWLER: Clinton's and Americans, Megyn.
KELLY: Dana, Richard, see you soon. New reaction tonight to the utter chaos dominating congress earlier today, when some Democrats mounted a last-ditch effort to derail Trump's win, hello, hello? Chris Stirewalt is next on that.
From the world headquarters of Fox News, it's ""The Kelly File."" with Megyn Kelly.
KELLY: Well, they had to do it. They could not resist. In a joint session of congress today, confirming the electoral vote, some Democrats could not stand the idea of a President Trump and mounted a last ditch effort to derail the official count. Ironically, it was Vice -President Joe Biden who is himself a Democrat who saved the day. Watch.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
JOE BIDEN, VICE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: Donald Trump of New York has received for president of the United States 304 votes. Hillary Clinton in the state of New York has received 227 vote.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Mr. President, the objection assigned by the member of the house but not yet by the member of the senate.
BIDEN: It is over.
(LAUGHTER)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The purpose of this joint session, having been concluded, the chair declares the joint session dissolved.
(APPLAUSE)
(CHEERS)
(END VIDEO CLIP)
KELLY: Fox News political editor Chris Stirewalt is here on what he calls a fitting end to the 2016 election cycle. I was hoping more for this big deal.
(LAUGHTER)
CHRIS STIREWALT, FOX NEWS DECISION DESK CORRESPONDENT: God saves the Queen. Maybe he is a Smith fan. Maybe chaos is the right way to end the most chaotic election that we remember. Maybe it's possible that we can handle some chaos. Maybe America is still fresh enough, strong enough, and able enough to deal with some chaotic moments. Donald Trump change the way that people did politics. It has been the same. Our job had been maybe too easy, since about 1992, every election has been the same bunch of canned corporate baloney from both sides. It was very predictable in the states were predictable, the counties were predictable and it was all the same jazz. Donald Trump brought chaos and now other people, like those Democrats you saw on the house today, those Democrats and others are going to try a little chaos of their own. Things are going to get weird for a period of time in America. We just have to have enough confidence that we can handle weirdness.
KELLY: Do think we can handle weirdness? I feel like you prove that single-handedly here night after night, for three years.
(LAUGHTER)
How long do you think Donald Trump can keep that up though? Do think that the chaos candidate as he was dubbed during the primary season, that will be a chaos president in the way we have seen?
STIREWALT: We have a tendency to misremember our own history and thinks that the way America was for let's say, the end of the cold war and period immediately after is the way things are always going to be. This has been a violent, chaotic, weird, crazy country and a lot of different ways. We've had riots. We had all these things that America has endured. I think what you saw from Joe Biden today was a good example for the country. Which is people, whatever happens, this is going to be ok. Our institutions, our systems can handle this. But the question for us as journalists, as citizens, and also for the people who participate in the process is can you raise your game to the next level to deal in entropy and when things change, when things become unpredictable, can you handle it? I think we can.
KELLY: The normally verbose Joe Biden with the line of the season, it's over. You can take the l out of lover, because it is over. And sadly, Mr. Stirewalt it is over for us too. And may I say it's been a pleasure.
STIREWALT: You bet councilor.
KELLY: We will be right back.
KELLY: A final word before we go. Night after night, you have welcomed us into your homes for some of the biggest moments in recent history. We have tried to live up to the honor of being there. I am sincerely grateful for your trust, your patience, and your good humor over the years. Which is one of the reasons why saying good-bye is so hard, but the truth is, I am lucky to have been doing a job whose ending is bittersweet. And I leave you knowing I am better for having been here. I hope you feel the same. Thank you, for everything. I will see you again, soon."
0	9	 10 von 72	Fox News Network	January 6, 2017 Friday	 THE O'REILLY FACTOR	 8:00 PM EST		"ERIC BOLLING, FOX NEWS HOST: Hi, I'm Eric Bolling in for Bill O'Reilly. Thanks for watching us tonight.
Let's get straight to our top story. Today's mass shooting at Fort Lauderdale International Airport in Florida. Five people are confirmed dead, another eight wounded after authorities say, 26-year-old Esteban Santiago, an Iraq war veteran, discharged by the Army National Guard last summer open fired in the airport's baggage claim area this afternoon.
The accused shooter is in custody and being questioned by federal authorities and this evening, his brother tells the Associated Press that he had been receiving psychological treatment while living Alaska.
Joining us now from Washington, FOX News National Security correspondent Jennifer Griffin. Jennifer, all day long, we've been hearing different reports of this man's mental instability. What's the latest? What are you hearing? 
JENNIFER GRIFFIN, FOX NEWS NATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT: Well, Eric, what I'm hearing from senior law enforcement sources late this evening, is that in fact this private first class who was on the Alaska Army National Guard was the being investigated on multiple occasions by, not only the FBI, but also the army CID, that's the Criminal Investigative Division. It's not clear what the army was investigating him for before he was let go, he was discharged last year.
In August 2016 for poor performance out in Alaska. And then we've just learned that the FBI has confirmed that in fact, he did seek, come to them to their field office in Anchorage, Alaska, back in November and say that he believed that the intelligence agencies, U.S. Intelligence Agencies had gotten a hold of his brain and were trying to convince him to join ISIS by making him watch ISIS videos. So, they immediately took him to local authorities. They took him to a mental hospital for some psychological workups.
At that point, sources here in Washington tell me that the FBI opened and enter agency investigation. They did not find any connection to foreign terrorism, but right now, we do know that the FBI is going through his electronic devices to see if there's any connection to any foreign terrorist organizations. But as of yet, there was never any evidence of that in the past. The FBI did speak to his family in the past, they did take this seriously when he came in back in November -- Eric.
BOLLING: Jennifer, I have about a minute -- so he approaches the FBI, the Alaska office and says, I think the U.S. government or someone is telling me to watch this ISIS propaganda videos. Does he at that point, get put on a no-fly list?
GRIFFIN: Well, that is really the question. Not only a no-fly list, but why was he -- we're going to need to know a lot more details about how he got a weapon because again, he was separated from the National Guard back in August of last year. And they have been investigating him, an interagency investigation. They had checked his name against databases I'm told for terrorist. And but again, they just didn't have enough evidence at that point in time to do anything more. But it is a question, I think these are the kinds of issues that are going to be raised in the coming days certainly.
BOLLING: Jennifer Griffin, thank you very much.
Joining us now with analysis from Los Angeles, terrorism expert Aaron Cohen and from Washington, the Center for Security Policies Jim Hanson.
Jim, will start with you. So, again, this thing just jumps out at me that he had visited the FBI field office in Alaska saying, ""hey, someone's telling me to watch these ISIS propaganda videos."" Why aren't red flags going off all over the place and why didn't we follow him? There was only two months ago.
JIM HANSON, EXECUTIVE VP, CENTER FOR SECURITY POLICY: I don't know why we have put up with the counterterrorism malfeasance at the Obama administration has been doing for the past eight years. They've handcuffed law enforcement and stop them from doing even the basic things they need to do to keep us safe. Now, there's something I would like to point out. The picture that you guys have of him, he's wearing the Kathia. That is the preferred neckwear of Palestinian terrorists.
And he's also holding up the one finger salute which is an ISIS gang sign essentially. Those two things lead me to believe that he is already affiliated himself in some way, shape, and form to them. And so, I think those needed to be taken into account. Whether he's crazy or not, ISIS told everyone to commit these acts, he committed an act. That is a dot that needs to be connected.
BOLLING: So, before we get further. FOX can't independently confirm the deaths. Actually his picture we think it is are reports that it is. Jim, talk to us a little bit. So, the FBI field office turns this guy over to law enforcement. Law enforcement sent him for evaluation and they come back and they find out what?
HANSON: Yes. We don't know. And that's just it. The problem is, we don't know what their determination was and why they didn't put him as you mentioned on a no-fly list, on some sort of surveillance. Why they didn't follow up and find out what his intentions were after he walks in and says, ""I'm being told to join ISIS."" Obviously, ISIS is in the business of killing innocence.
BOLLING: Yes.
HANSON: So, this guy essentially offered himself up and they turned him down again.
BOLLING: And Aaron, what do you think? Where do we break down? Obviously we break down because we didn't follow him further and put him on a no fly list. You now, one of the other things, you know, in order to bring a fire arm on an airplane, you have to have a military ID. At some point, if he's data unstable, maybe you pull his military ID or some sort of designation saying, hey, hold on, no firearms to the sky.
AARON COHEN, TERRORISM EXPERT: Eric, my soul belief in terms of the breakdown in the system, there's no question the sky was crazy. Obviously he was unstable. I'm with Jim. You know, he could've had some type of, you know, some kind of, you know, aberration in his head where he felt like he was getting images of ISIS placed into his head and he had to go carry out these acts of terror. Whatever the case may be, my contention is that the real failure here was, when are we going to start looking at the airports as a total security package and not just the planes in the air?
We can allow any areas in the airport to not be completely sterile because if we only feel safe in the plane, again the goal of the terrorist is psychological. So, we're not going to go through the airports because were worried about getting shot up in the baggage claim, or getting shot up in the unsterile area before we go to the check-in. That's my concern. And earlier, I heard the deputy, former deputy of the (audio gap). You know, talking about how everything was (audio gap).
Look, Law Enforcement was outstanding. Their response was excellent. It was fast, it was on point. They must take this guy without shooting him or killing him, fine. But security isn't about response. It's about prevention. Could you imagine had this been an AK-47 assault rifle, fully automatic with a suicide vest on like we just saw on Turkey or in Europe? That's my concern.
BOLLING: So, Aaron Erin, I want to follow-up with you because I was the one who asked that -- Mr. Blank I believe his name, that question.
COHEN: I remember.
BOLLING: What about hardening the airport that, the counters in the baggage claim areas and he said, well, yes, you know, that's something we have to consider but there's some 450 airports. And my question is, look, look at what happened in Turkey. The same thing happened when a terrorist walked into the terminal, before they hit the security checkpoint and just started mowing down people. So, is it time to look at what it's going to cost to lock down, to harden every single airport in America?
COHEN: Eric, am I the only one in this country who hasn't been to the airport in Tel Aviv?
BOLLING: Yes.
COHEN: The security there is based, it's psychologically-based. There's undercover operatives crawling through that airport. Every LL counter across this country, the 450 airports, the thousands of flights a day, undercover law enforcement officers with pocket police caps that fold up. So that they can do the real security work. Keep this in their pocket in a boy friendly fire. The LL counter. The LL agents are the ones we need to take the TSA --
BOLLING: Yes.
(CROSSTALK)
If you do some of these things, Jim, you're called a racist or you're called Islamaphobic because you're targeting and you're profiling and the left believes that's wrong.
HANSON: How many more people have to die before we face the indisputable fact that it is radical Islam that's inspiring these people and we start targeting that? Now, it's not all Muslims, let's be clear. We need the help of Muslims who don't agree with this to catch these guys before it happens. It's a fact that these guys come from that beliefs system and we need to go ahead and make that a priority, allow our law enforcement to do what the equivalent of profiling and look where the bad guys are.
BOLLING: Guys, I don't have a lot of time. Very quickly. Both of you. I'll start with you Aaron. He wasn't Muslim as far as I know. He may have been but it didn't look like her. By the sound of his name, I guess I shouldn't generalize that, but that necessarily would have shown up on a profile.
COHEN: Well, listen, the attack, the intention. The way he carried out the attack could have been prevented had you had just a couple of uniformed police officers in the baggage claim area. That would have been your deterrence layer. Your second layer would have been your detection layer which is the undercover guy again looking for, looking for somebody running off to a bathroom.
And here's another thing, you know, listen, I'm all for transporting our firearms. And again, Eric, I'm just trying to focus on individual nuggets of how to reduce this type of attack from happening again. You know, I'm all for guns traveling all over the country. There are thousands of law- abiding citizens who can transport a firearm legally. But the fact is, is that, you know, if you're going to check that gun onto the plane, it might be time to get a little more like JFK and La Guardia and start cross screening those weapons a little bit tighter to make sure those guns are not stolen and that the intent is in there to do anything other than travel with the gun peacefully.
BOLLING: Gentleman, good debate. I got to leave it right there.
COHEN: Thank you very much.
BOLLING: Next on the rundown, more on the deadly shooting rampage of Fort Lauderdale Airport where there were sheer pandemonium. Is law enforcement prepared enough to deal with the acts like this? That's up ahead.
BOLLING: Continuing now with our top story today. A shooting rampage at Florida's Fort Lauderdale International Airport. It was pure chaos after the shooting began near the baggage claim area. Passengers running from the terminal areas onto the tarmac and surrounding highway. About an hour later, when a false report of another active shooter set off, another panic, panic ensued.
Today's events highlights how vulnerable soft targets places outside of the security checkpoints can be.
Joining us now from Chicago, Garry McCarthy, the former superintendent of the Police Department in Chicago. Mr. McCarthy, let's begin with the pandemonium. First of all, you know, there were a lot of the law enforcement there. And there was a couple, sets of panic, what did they right and what did they do wrong today?
GARRY MCCARTHY, FORMER SUPERINTENDENT, CHICAGO POLICE DEPARTMENT: Well, the first thing they did right was isolate, contain, identify the target, and taken into custody relatively quickly. Without further incident, there is obviously a lot of damage that was done. I think that there were some holes in the system as the two gentlemen was speaking about before me. I've been to Ben Gurion Airport and I was escorted by the Israeli police in and out. I still felt the security all over me all at the same time.
Even though I was being kind of whisked through their security. We do have to look at airports outside of those checkpoints in the same vein. And I can tell you this here in Chicago, two things. First of all, I suspect that this young man walked into an FBI office and said that, you know, he was hearing voices, ISIS was infecting his brain and so on and so forth. It's entirely possible, and I believe that it's even likely. But here's a man with some mental issues who eventually become subject to ISIS rhetoric.
They have a very powerful propaganda machine. And I suspect that we may found out that he may have been watching some of those videos online. So, he has some mental issues in his past, he is now being subject to this propaganda, perhaps he acts on it. Can't tell at this point. But the fact is, the joint terrorism task forces are not going to run that investigation from a A to Z. They're going to take it A, B, C when they determine that perhaps he's a man with mental issues and not an actual terrorist or a terrorist threat.
BOLLING: So, let me stop you. So, A, B, C, this was in November.
MCCARTHY: Right.
BOLLING: I mean, this guy walked into an FBI filed office two months ago.
MCCARTHY: Right.
BOLLING: I mean, to me, it feels like someone let him go, dropped the ball, didn't follow him. Should we be following guys like this?
MCCARTHY: Well, that's where I was going to go. It's probably not up to the JTTF to now pursue this guy from J to Z (ph). And here in Chicago, and I'm going to give credit to our former chief of organized crime Nick Rody (ph). We came up with the system where when the JTTF vets the case and determine and said it's not that serious, that they're going to keep it. Our Intel division took it and rundown the rest of it. We are finding some gaps in there that perhaps we are closing and stopping some things from happening and that's the type of system that has to --
BOLLING: Sure. Sure. You know what that sounds like. It sounds like a lot of money, you know, very quickly, I only have about a minute or so. You mentioned hardening these soft targets including the ticket counter and the baggage claim basically making the airport a security safe once you enter until you leave. That's a lot of money too.
MCCARTHY: Right. It sure is. And we have officers trained with heavy weapons at O'Hare and Midway. You will see S.W.A.T. officers at O'Hare and Midway on a regular basis when they're on patrol. Sometimes we got a couple that we can assign there. People feel good when that happens. And at the same time, it provides a separate level of safety that perhaps people don't see all the time.
BOLLING: All right. Mr. McCarthy, thank you very much.
Up next, a damning intelligence report released today finding Vladimir Putin was behind last year's hacking attacks. Top Trump advisor Kellyanne Conway enters the No Spin Zone to respond. Stay tuned.
BOLLING: In the ""Impact Segment"" tonight, Russian hacking in the U.S. election. Today a long-awaited D-classified intelligence report was released. It fingers Russian President Vladimir Putin for ordering a campaign to influence the U.S. election including cyber-attacks against the DNC and other party officials. A short time ago, I spoke with Donald Trump counselor Kellyanne Conway about the report and Donald Trump's classified briefing today on the subject. But first, we address today's events in Fort Lauderdale.
Okay, Kellyanne, can we get your response, your reaction to the Fort Lauderdale shooting earlier today?
KELLYANNE CONWAY, COUNSELOR TO PRESIDENT-ELECT DONALD TRUMP: Well, it is a tragedy and the President-elect has been in touched with Governor Rick Scott of Florida. The President-elect is monitoring the situation, has expressed his condolences and his support for those who have lost loved ones and those who are injured certainly. And it's just a very sad day whenever this happens.
BOLLING: Yes. And we can point out that the President-elect did contact Rick Scott within, maybe minutes, maybe an hour. So, after the suspect was apprehended, meanwhile, if you remember back to the Orlando shooting, the Pulse Nightclub shooting, that massacre 49 people, I think Governor Scott complained to the following day that he had not yet heard from President Obama.
CONWAY: I do recall that slightly, and I do think it's important for the president of the United States, in this case it will be Donald Trump soon, to take the action and make sure that we are always in touch with the first responders, the elected officials in the given state and that is in fact what the President-elect did today and calling Governor Scott. We know that security is poorest in some of these common areas but that aside, I think we all just join together in moments like this and feel the tragedy is won. And this really, this is the time that the President-elect was about to have his security briefing, his intelligence briefing today. He took the time to call Governor Scott and to make that connection to offer support and prayers.
BOLLING: Let's talk a little bit about that briefing now. This document. There's a classified document that became declassified earlier today. You know, I'm reading through it Kellyanne. It looks like the Intel Department, the heads of Intel squarely put the blame on Russia and they're actually saying that Russia was attempting to influence our elections.
CONWAY: So, we learned two things today. One is that the DNC ignored the FBI's request to turn over their service, to give them information. They ignored those requests. And they just failed to have the proper defense hacking mechanisms in place that would prevent this from happening. The Russians also tried to hacked into the RNC but the RNC had a much better system in large part because the Republican presidential nominee Donald J. Trump insisted that they do. And so, that was impenetrable. We also see that the Russian hacking, there's China hacks, Russia hacks, but the question is, what was the effect of it? And did this influence the outcome of the elections? Did one vote move because of this? And there is no clear evidence of that.
BOLLING: Can I read, Kellyanne, little bit from that? That document that we learn that says, and I'm quoting, ""We asses Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an influence campaign in 2016 aimed at the U.S. presidential election. Russia's goals were to undermine public faith in the U.S. Democratic process. Denigrate Secretary Clinton and harm her electability and potential presidency and we have a high confidence in these judgments."" You know, it certainly sounds like it's political to me. Am I wrong?
CONWAY: No. We feel that way as well. We certainly don't want intelligence interfering with politics and we don't want politics interfering with intelligence. But when the President-elect said earlier today to ""The New York Times"" as it seems like the focus, a political witch-hunt. When he needs exactly that, why are we talking about this now? Is Mr. Clapper said what he said in October, Eric, and the President of the United States basically didn't say much about it.
Hillary Clinton mention it at a debate, but you didn't see the $1.2 billion the Clinton campaign spent going towards ads and public service announcements warning everybody that this was going to affect the outcome of the election. Why? Because they felt that that she was going to end. And it was only after she did not win that they've been appellant froth about this. So making very clear, we're against any foreign government interfering in our nation, that is very clear. At the same time, let's not draw an axis for one does not exist between attempts and actual result.
If anybody can tell me that Hillary Clinton lost for any reason other than, she had -- she was a terrible messenger, I still don't know what her message was, please help me out. Anybody can write to me if you know what her message was.
BOLLING: Right.
CONWAY: Her message was, I'm not Donald Trump. And it was not enough. Her message was, I'm not Donald Trump and it wasn't enough. His message was, I'm here -- I'm going to be a tougher commander-in-chief and president of the United States.
BOLLING: But if the Intel Department -- the heads of the Intel Departments are drawing that, what you call it a Nazis and that therefore maybe point politics, will Donald Trump, President Donald Trump, make sweeping changes to the leadership and Intel?
CONWAY: Well, the one thing that Donald Trump said today as the President- elect, I think it's very important in his statement, Eric, is that he will convene his own panel. And within nine days, perhaps he will take action. He wants to talk to his own intelligence community. He wants to talk to his own advisors about what makes sense moving forward. A lot of the people are just looking back to the selection. And I'm just so struck by the number of people who talk about how these following things happen.
Russia hacked and Hillary Clinton lost. And trying to pretend they're not making an axis when in fact, they are. When you see even on FOX News, it's been talked about how the DNC was hacked, the Pentagon was hacked, the White House was hacked, why wasn't anybody in this upward when 21 million records were hacked and our office and personnel management basically a government origin? Twenty one million private confidential records of Americans, what was the punishment then? How many operatives were expelled? You know, who was up in arms?
So, this does smack of politics. And let me repeat, we are against any interference, but at the same time, people trying to over politicize this in a way, you can't get them excited to talk about hate crimes against a disabled white boy in Chicago, you can't get them excited to talk about the fact that Minority Leader Chuck Schumer is promise to distract every Supreme Court justice we put in front of them and slow walk our cabinet nominees. Even though President Obama had seven confirmed on inauguration day in 2009.
Five additional that week and 13 by the following week by voice vote. President George W. Bush had even confirmed. So, that should really get this country up in arms about interfering with democracy. And let's be frank, you know who interfered with the election, again and again, the mainstream media by telling us all that Hillary Clinton was a shoe in.
BOLLING: Let me ask you this along those lines. You mentioned James Crawford, DNI James Clapper, take a listen to what he said yesterday. Someone's testimony on Capitol Hill.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
JAMES CLAPPER, NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE DIRECTOR: This is a multifaceted campaign, so the hacking was only one part of it. And it also entailed, you know, classical propaganda, misinformation, fake news.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
BOLLING: So, Kellyanne, he blamed fake news on some of the attacks and the interference on the election. Very quickly. I only have a little bit time. We're going to bring you back after the break. But does President- elect Donald Trump and will President Donald Trump have confidence in Clapper?
CONWAY: Well, the President has faith in the intelligence community. But he also is putting his own intelligence team for many reasons. Mr. Clapper has said, look, he came out in October and said something. The response from Barack Obama about Vladimir Putin and hacking earlier in the summer was, quote, ""knock it off."" Boy, that's going to be really scare somebody. Knock it off. And he's trying to be tough guy. It was just a couple of weeks ago in his term. So, none of that rings true. The other thing that Mr. Clapper had made clear yesterday, is he had to clarify that did not influence those votes.
BOLLING: Right.
CONWAY: And that Senator Tom Cotton from Arkansas also made the point that Donald Trump has promised with oil and gas -- through modernizing our nuclear capability and our ballistic missiles and certainly through expanding our defense budget, Eric, they he will put America in a stronger position in a way that you can argue is against Russia's, Moscow's political and economic entry. And Donald Trump won on that platform.
BOLLING: Kellyanne, allow me to do, I'm up against hard break. I'd like to bring you back right after the break.
CONWAY: Okay, thank you.
BOLLING: I have more with Kellyanne in a moment. Including Joe Biden taking a verbal shot at her boss. Don't go away.
BOLLING: We continue now with our conversation with Donald Trump Counselor Kellyanne Conway. A short time ago, we spoke about the escalating fight to repeal ObamaCare along with a shot over the bow of her boss from Vice President Joe Biden.
All right. We're back with Kellyanne Conway. Take a listen to Joe Biden. All was the entertaining guy to listen to when he had something to say about Donald Trump. Please listen.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
VICE PRES. JOE BIDEN (D), UNITED STATES: Donald, grow up. Time to be an adult, your president. You've got to do something. Show us what you have.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
BOLLING: All right, Kellyanne, the reaction from the guy who has threatened to take Donald Trump out behind the school yard or something to that effect.
CONWAY: Well, it's really disappointing to hear the Vice President speak that way, not surprising. To what is he referring? The fact that his Democratic Party under his watch has been a number two guy in the country within the Democratic Party, they lost over 1,000 state legislative seats, they've lost over a dozen governorships, over a dozen Senate seats, they lost 68 House seats. They lost the elections in 2010, 2014, 2016. And large part because of the policies that he supported like the also unaffordable, inaccessible care act, ObamaCare.
Like these Draconian taxes and regulations on small businesses and on the rest of us. Like all of these bad trade deals that never benefited our American workers and if Donald Trump who came in, you know, without Joe Biden and Barack Obama, there may not have been a President Donald Trump and a Vice President Mike Pence. So, I'd like to tell that Vice President, thanks for the non-advice (INAUDIBLE). And very much appreciate all the failed policies that allowed us to usher in a new era of hopefulness and buoyancy, fresh blood and excitement in this administration.
You're going to see President Donald Trump very quickly, Eric, deliver and perform and be accountable to results as he's always done in his wildly successful business. It's going to be brand new. I think not just the tone but the content in Washington.
BOLLING: Uh-hm. And one of the things, I'm glad you brought that up. One of the things that Donald Trump is promising to repeal and replace ObamaCare. President Obama weighed in on his signature legislation. Listen to this. It's pretty surprising.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
PRES. BARACK OBAMA (D), UNITED STATES: Now is the time when Republicans I think have to go ahead and show their cards. If, in fact, they have a program that would genuinely work better, and they want to call it whatever they want, they can call it Trump care, they can call it McConnell care or Ryan care. If it actually works, I will be the first one to say, great. You should have told me that back in 2009. I asked.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
BOLLING: Okay. I think the Republicans are trying to help in 2009. They were complete shut up.
CONWAY: Yes.
BOLLING: They couldn't vote for ObamaCare. But how is this? TrumpCare?
CONWAY: He's just being sarcastic. I don't know why. It's not very becoming, here's the thing. I was in the closed door meeting with the Republican conference on Wednesday that was led by our Vice President-elect Mike Pence. The main topic of conversations is repealing and replacing ObamaCare. Having a very serious ultimate conversation about how exactly to do that, knowing that millions of people rely upon it, knowing that pre- existing condition coverage is popular.
But Eric, we did try to help in 2009. We were rebuffed and won everything not nailed to the ground in 2010 because ObamaCare was the first major entitlement pass in this country without a single vote from one of the two political parties. A pass without a single Republican vote, his party owns it. And it will not be a great part of his legacy because you have millions of Americans who are paying higher premiums, 116 percent increase in Arizona. Fifty three percent increase in Pennsylvania but rate example.
You've got people with fewer choices, lower quality, less access, and more frustration and less certainty. The biggest lie and the biggest piece of fake news I've heard in the last ten years, if you like your doctor you can keep your doctor. If you like your plan, you can keep your plan. Big lies that had real consequences for Americans. Donald Trump and Mike Pence are going to allow you to buy your health insurance across state lines.
They're going to allow you to have a health savings account where you control more of your spending, your health care spending, they're going to permit individual polls. They're going to block Medicaid to the state. And there is so many positive free markets reforms in health care and more patient's centric and less government's centric. And people are excited. Look, the Republicans won in 2010, '14, and 16 in large parts because of ObamaCare. They nominated RomneyCare in 2012 and couldn't talk about the issue.
BOLLING: Kelly, I only have about half a minute or so. But is there a way to get the Democrats to play ball and work with Donald Trump?
CONWAY: I think so.
BOLLING: Chuck Schumer has already said, we're not going to work with them. Nancy Pelosi said forget it, we are not working with him.
CONWAY: Well, look at where they represent there. Chuck Schumer represents New York and she represents San Francisco. Not exactly represents with the rest of the country where people are suffering under ObamaCare. I believe that the his ten Democratic senator that after the election in states that Donald Trump won and five of the states he won by double digits, I think they will play ball on ObamaCare repeal. And I think they'll play ball on tax repackage because they know what their constituents won. If they're being honest to those they represent. They will go according to those constituents and not according to petty partisan politics.
BOLLING: Kellyanne Conway, always great to spend some time with you. Thank you very much.
CONWAY: Thank you, Eric.
BOLLING: And coming up next, how should the incoming Trump administration respond to Russia after today's Intel report? Will take a hard look at that right after this.
BOLLING: Thanks for staying with us. I'm Eric Bolling in for Bill O'Reilly. In THE FACTOR ""Follow-Up Segment"" tonight, President Obama weighing in tonight on the release of the declassified reports on Russian hacking. The President says, it's clear the Russians meddled and had some words for anyone who does it.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
OBAMA: One of the things that I am concerned about is the degree to which we've seen a lot of commentary lately where the Republicans or pundits or cable commentators who seem to have more confidence in Vladimir Putin than fellow Americans because those fellow Americans are Democrats. That cannot be.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Does that include the President-elect?
OBAMA: Well, what I will say is that, and I said this right after the election. We have to remind ourselves were on the same team. Vladimir Putin is not on our team.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
BOLLING: Joining us now from Houston to analyze, national security analyst Arash Aramesh and with us in studio, Scott Uehlinger, former CIA operations officer who worked in the former Soviet Union for 12 years. I want to get with you because you're the right guy at the right time. Hang on though.
Arash, I'm reading this report. I'm looking for the smoking gun. I can't find a gun and it ain't smoking.
(LAUGHTER)
ARASH ARAMESH, NATIONAL SECURITY EXPERT: Well, if you read the report carefully, you'll see that --
BOLLING: Okay. That's my problem. I didn't read it carefully enough, that's what you're saying. Go ahead. I did, but go ahead. Let's hear what you had to say.
ARAMESH: Well, you know, one thing they teach in law school is critical reading and I'm very glad I went to law school. So, but when you read it critically and carefully and you analyze --
BOLLING: You know what they teach in high school? When you have a theory, you have to test the theory and you have to prove the theory, I'm still looking for the prove part of this theory.
ARAMESH: And there is a difference Eric between intelligence and evidence. We're talking about an intelligence report. The NSA, the FBI, and the CIA through the office of the director of National Intelligence came out with this report. This is a declassified version of a much more detailed and classified version of your report that says three things. A, there was an organized orchestrated effort by a high Russian officials including President Vladimir Putin to try to influence our election. B, the Russian intelligence and Russian hackers part took and took part in this hack. And C, we have to make sure that going forward we have the necessary tools in place to prevent such attacks from happening in our country.
BOLLING: Okay. Good. True. I'll give you A, B, and C. The problem Scott, is that these are again theories and hypotheses without any evidence to prove it.
SCOTT UEHLINGER, FORMER CIA OPERATIONS OFFICER: Right. I mean, I've reviewed the report and it certainly -- put it this way. Most of the things I've seen in this report, these conditions existed at least ten years ago. This administration has never indicated an interest in Russian operations against this country until it seems to have hurt the Democratic Party. Now suddenly, they have become aware of the Russian threat a day late and a dollar short at the 11th hour.
BOLLING: Okay. Arash, what's new in this report? I mean, Scott points out -- by the way, there are a lot of countries doing this. We know at least four or five actors who are actively trying to do the exact same thing.
ARAMESH: You know, Scott and myself, you know, you live and work to an ex- Soviet Union, we worked in Moldova, Ukraine, Belarus, Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia. We are very familiar with Russian efforts to try to undermine fair and free elections in those countries except Belarus because there is no fair and free elections in Belarus. But again, in Ukraine, Moldova and in soviet countries --
BOLLING: So, what's new? Arash, what's new in the report?
ARAMESH: Very intimately similar. And if you remember, the U.S., you know, Scott just said that President Obama had no interest in helping anti- Russian forces in the U.S. around the world. That is not true. Look what we did in the Ukraine.
BOLLING: Oh my goodness! Oh my God! Arash, you're down in the rabbit hole. Law school thing is taking you all way up Sixth Avenue, take a left on 57th. Go ahead Scott, tell me what's new in this report.
UEHLINGER: The thing that's new is that for once, the Russians have been trying to do this for many years and they have not been effective at it. The reason they were perhaps more effective at it if we are to believe this report is because Hillary Clinton provided them an ideal target. She compromised herself totally and it's this year that the Russians worked to undermine her credibility. She undermine her own credibility and it was merely the Russians that revealed it. The Russians had never claimed nor the Democrats claimed that the Russians manufacture this material. This email material. It's all genuine Democratic emails.
BOLLING: Arash, you're a nice guy. And I like you a lot. I'll give you 15 seconds. Final thought.
ARAMESH: That is simply not true. Unfortunately, the Russians found a very good ally in President-elect Trump and that is very sad. And Scott, here is the --
BOLLING: I've got to go. I've got to go. Brother, I've got to go. I'm sorry. Arash, Scott, thank you very much. Great debate you guys.
Up next, Donald Trump doubling down on his vow to make Mexico reimbursed the United States. I said it, reimburse the United States for a new border wall and Mexico's former president is doubling down on his refusal to do it. We'll be right back with that.
BOLLING: In the ""Unresolved Problem Segment"" tonight, who will pay for a new border wall with Mexico? Media reports out today said, President-elect Donald Trump is planning to have Congress fiance its construction but Trump says, the media got it wrong again. He's going to make Mexico reimburse the United States and that is something he's said before?
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENT-ELECT: I said Mexico is paying for the wall. With the full understanding that the country of Mexico will be reimbursing the United States for the full cost of such a war. Okay?
(END VIDEO CLIP)
BOLLING: Well, former Mexican President Vicente Fox, one of Donald Trump's fiercest critics fired off this tweet today. ""Trump, when will you understand that I am not paying for that f-ing wall. Be clear with U.S. tax payers. They will pay for it."" And he used the whole word in the tweet.
Joining us now to analyze, from Washington, Katrina Pierson, former Trump campaign national spokesperson. And here in studio, Democratic strategists Jessica Tarlov. Katrina, I got to go to you. First, guess what, he is not going to pay for that f-ing wall.
KATRINA PIERSON, FORMER TRUMP CAMPAIGN NATIONAL SPOKESPERSON: Well, look, I mean, this is something that President-elect Trump has been saying from the beginning. You know, the wall being built was never contingent upon the Mexican government making a one-time payment, Eric. I will point to you, back in March 2016, the campaign released a two page document showing you exactly how Mexico would be paying for the wall.
And of course they're given the option to make a payment. But then Donald Trump outlined several ways that Mexico will pay for it. Whether it is provisions in the Patriot Act, to withhold remittances on wire transfers going into Mexico to increasing visa fees. Tariffs. There were a number of ways that a president administration under Trump would be able to recruit that money.
BOLLING: All right. Jess, so this morning, I'm watching TV, and the media, the mainstream media is going, aha, I told you he was going to backtrack on the wall. But this is something he said, that sound bite was from October 22nd. Notice, notice, prior to the election. Nothing is inconsistent.
JESSICA TARLOV, DEMOCRATIC POLLSTER AND STRATEGIST: There are always inconsistencies in Trump world, but he has always said that we would have it. Firs they're going to pay now. We're going to pay. They're going to pay us back. I got it. But what also been consistent here that the American public doesn't want this wall. Polling shown a 58 percent are against it, 59 percent has said that they don't think Mexico will be paying for that on top of it. And what's interesting even when you look at Republicans, you have over 70 percent in favor of halfway to citizenship and 62 percent said, they wanted the law. Now, it is the height of the country --
BOLLING: Katrina, what do you think? Do you think the Trump voters want the wall?
PIERSON: Well, what I say is --
TARLOV: Trump Tower, Trump voters are different.
PIERSON: It's the foundation to Donald Trump's immigration policy. Because we understand that it's not just about immigration, it's about drug trafficking, it's about sex trafficking, and Donald Trump won. This is something that I do think many Americans want. But I do also believe that the dishonest media and the Left have really been putting out a misinformation about this wall to begin with. And that's going to be up to the Trump administration to get out there and say why this is so important without that filter which is another reason Eric, it is important that Donald Trump maintain his Twitter account to continue to correct the record.
TARLOV: Katrina, listen, I think that Donald Trump uncensored, it's a hugely entertaining thing. Enjoy rating -- don't follow him, maybe he wanted to become president, I will. But I just told you that 58 percent of Americans don't want the border wall. So, when you say many Americans, we're talking about Trump diehards. These are also people who like to say, lock her up. Right. These are people who also want a Muslim band. These are all things that are not going to happen in a Donald Trump presidency.
BOLLING: Wait. Hold on. Jessica, are you saying there is not going to be a wall?
TARLOV: I am saying there is not going to be a wall. If there is a wall, I will go through that golden door. I will do it on live television --
(CROSSTALK)
And the door is going to be beautiful. Last thought, Katrina. Quick.
PIERSON: Well, look, they chanted at the DNC, lock her up. So, this isn't just diehard Trump supporters. Okay, Jessica? And at the end of the day - - at the end of the day, 70 percent of Americans did not want ObamaCare and guess what?
BOLLING: Okay. We have it. That's right. We got to leave it, you guys, great debate. Jessica, Katrina, thank you very much. When we return, the latest developments on today's mass shooting in Fort Lauderdale, we will be right back.
BOLLING: You are looking live at a live picture of the Fort Lauderdale International Airport, where we are waiting for an update from the FBI on the mass shooting earlier today that left five people dead and eight people injured. Meantime, the airport is still closed to departing and arriving flights. But passengers with personal vehicles are now being allowed to leave the airport. And those without cars are being bused to another location where they can get a ride.
Joining us now to analyze from Boise, Idaho, former CIA covert operations officer Mike Baker. Mike, bring home, we talk about this at the beginning of the show. What do we need, I think a lot of people are seeing there and thinking, man, seeing those people on that tarmac today, I pray I am never in that situation. How do we avoid that going forward?
MIKE BAKER, FORMER CIA COVERT OPERATIONS OFFICER: Well, I mean, yes, there are a couple parts of it. One is, how does the government react, what is the DHS said and others do, this is been a long debate. This is not something news. We talk about, the security perimeter effectively lie in an airport or transportation facility. You know, you push the security perimeter out further out into the public area before you get to the security barrier and you'd just pushing out the problem. You're creating more of an issue.
BOLLING: Yes. But are you, though? Are you though? Because when you are in the building, you are in an enclosed space. These airports are busier crammed in with a lot of people. Once you get out that door, it can dissipate and become a far softer target, right?
BAKER: Well, not really. Because think about it. All you are doing is pushing that gathering out further because now you've still going to get through security. So, look, this is something, I guess what I'm saying is, this is not a new issue. They've been agonizing over this for some time. Not just does but our allies overseas and anybody, you know, the responsible for these sorts of facilities. The other part is as you pointed out is, what can you do? As an individual.
Look, you are walking around, the unfortunate reality is that we are never going to reduce these sort of incidents down to zero. It's not going to happen. So what can you do? You can't always be in a high state of alert? It is not going to happen, even when you are a professional at this sort of thing. So what you do is whenever you go into a situation where you're standing in a crowd, you're in a public event, you're at a transportation facility like in an airport, whatever it may be that's when you raise your alert.
BOLLING: All right. But let me give you an example. You know, you go to a football here, right? When you walk in the stadium, in the seats, you are being, you're metal detected, they're going through your bags, before you're even there, you are not near the playing field. In the airport, you can walk through the terminal. Sometimes you can go shopping before you're even checked through security.
BAKER: Right. You've just -- what I'm saying is, any time you're in that general -- I don't mean when you're just standing there with a bunch people. I mean, when you're entering into a large crowded facility, right? A shopping mall, whatever. This is not rocket science but all you do is, you just have to be more aware of your surroundings. You're never going to be way up here all the time. But just pick and choose. Figure out when to be more aware, what's going on around you. And then look, your options unfortunately, are unsatisfying but they're limited. If something starts to touch off, you got to get away. You got to hide and if there's an option, you got a fight. And that stops to do. Because, you know, generally, people lock up from the shock of something like this.
BOLLING: All right. Very quickly Michael, we're only about 50 seconds or so. Profiling, is it time to reopen that debate?
Well, I think we should always be looking at profiling. You know, in a professional manner. And people lose their minds sometime, some people lose their minds when you talked about profiling. The reality is, you know what? Done in the proper manner, it works.
BOLLING: Yes.
BAKER: When we are talking about this. Now, this is not necessarily a terrorism related shooting and that's going to be figured out. But --
BOLLING: Mike, I've got to go, buddy.
BAKER: Sure.
BOLLING: I'm up against hard break. Thank you very much.
That's it for us tonight. Thanks for watching. I'm Eric Bolling in for Bill O'Reilly who will be back on Monday. And please remember, the spin stops right here. Because we are looking out for you."
0	10	 11 von 72	Fox News Network	January 6, 2017 Friday	 TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT	 7:00 PM EST		"TUCKER CARLSON, FOX NEWS HOST: We begin with a ""Fox News"" alert. A gunman shot and killed five people and wounded at least eight others at the Ft. Lauderdale airport today.
Good evening and welcome to ""Tucker Carlson Tonight."" We begin our show with ""Fox"" national correspondent Phil Keating, who was live on the scene in Florida.
Phil?
PHIL KEATING, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Tucker, the city here remains on lockdown as law enforcement of the Broward County sheriff's department leading it going through the garages, checking every single vehicle as well as every square inch of the airport property that includes all four terminals as well as the airfields and tarmacs. 
There had been helicopters with spotlights tonight flying over the runway, making sure there is nothing suspicious out there. Essentially they are making sure this airport is entirely at 100 percent safe and secure before they resume airport operations which may not now happen, I am hearing, until possibly tomorrow.
No one is allowed to enter the airport property by car. No one is allowed to leave airport property, which means there are hundreds and hundreds of people out on the curb outside of terminal 1, which was evacuated around 2:00 this afternoon, five hours ago. And there's a bunch of people inside terminal 2, who had made it through security prior to the 1:00 shooting and where at the gate areas waiting for their planes to pull up and then, you know, on the jetway's and fly off to their destinations. They have not been allowed to leave.
So for most of the people or everyone outside, they have had no access to bathrooms or food for five hours. And I have seen some paramedics taking structures inside terminal 2 behind me, probably to deal with some sort of medical situations regarding some of these passengers.
Now the deck below me here at terminal 2 is where the baggage claim area is. And around 1:00, that is when about 4 minutes of carnage were unleashed when witnesses say the named shooter/suspect in this case, Esteban Santiago, went to baggage claim, got his luggage, and then went into the bathroom, took his gun out of the luggage, out of the lockbox, which he had packed and checked in Anchorage, Alaska, to fly via Minneapolis to Fort Lauderdale, then loaded the gun, and then went out into the baggage claim area and started shooting people in the head.
13 people shot, blood everywhere, five people dead, and eight people wounded and currently being treated at Broward County hospitals. Then it seemed that the airport kind of starting to settle down, but then, 45 minutes later, it was absolute panic and terror again as there were reports of gun shots in the garage, S.W.A.T. teams running in there, heavily armed. And then there were people running out of terminal 1, onto the tarmac, across the runways with their luggage, running as far away from the airport property as possible because there were other reports that people had heard gunshots in terminal 1.
The sheriff says none of that was actually gunfire. There was only one shooting instance today and that was at 1:00, according to witnesses it lasted about 4 minutes, 13 people were shot, eight wounded, five brutally murdered, and the law enforcement that responded fired no weapons. They order the gunman down to the ground, he surrendered, was handcuffed, and has been in custody since shortly after 1:00.
The latest on his personal background, his brother and mother tell ""The New York Daily News,"" he is being treated for mental health issues recently.
And law enforcement sources are telling ""Fox News"" that in November of last year, so two months ago, he went into the Anchorage, Alaska FBI field office telling them that U.S. intelligence was planting thoughts of ISIS in his brain.
They checked them out, put him on their list. They said they found no connection to terror, but this was an absolutely terrorizing two hours for all of the hundreds and thousands of travelers here today.
Tucker?
CARLSON: Phil, thanks a lot for that. What a sad story.
We go now to the State Department where we are joined by ""Fox News"" national security correspondent, Jennifer Griffin, who has more on the gunmen tonight.
Jennifer?
JENNIFER GRIFFIN, FOX NEWS NATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT: Well, Tucker, I just got off the phone with law enforcement sources here in Washington who tell me that the gunmen, Private First Class Esteban Santiago was in fact investigated on multiple occasions by not only the FBI but also the Army CID. That's the criminal investigative division.
We know that he served and Alaska and in Alaska Army National Guard unit. We've spoken to a spokesman out there who confirms that he did separate back last year in August of 2016. He did serve one tour in Iraq. That was from 2010-2011, February 2011.
I would note that that was not a very, very active time for the military in Iraq. That was just before they pulled out at the end of that year. He was a combat engineer.
He was separated from the National Guard from the Alaska National Guard for poor performance, we are told, by the spokesman out in Alaska.
He joined the National Guard, the Puerto Rican National Guard in 2007 and that is who he deployed with to Iraq. His family says, has told reporters, that he did suffer some mental problems after returning from Iraq and what we do know and Matt Dean (ph), our producer, at the Justice Department has talked to law enforcement sources who do confirmed that in fact in November, he did go into an FBI field office in Anchorage, not far from where he was living, and that he did say that he was having these -- he believed that U.S. intelligence had infiltrated his mind, trying to convince them to join ISIS and forcing him to watch ISIS videos as Phil Keating just reported.
At that moment, law enforcement -- FBI turned him over to law enforcement and law enforcement then had him taken to be mentally checked out at a hospital. And at that point, the FBI and DHS, Department of Homeland Security, opened an inter-agency review. They looked into his background. They began talking to his family members, but they did not find any connection to foreign terrors overseas at that time.
Back to you, Tucker.
CARLSON: Jennifer Griffin, thanks a lot for that.
Well, Congress confirmed Donald Trump's presidential bid by accepting his 304 electoral votes. It's official. But that doesn't stop a group of more than 170 Democrats in Congress from trying to set up a taxpayer funded commission to investigate Russian meddling in the election.
The Protecting Our Democracy Act or PODA would give a 12-member committee a full 18 months to look into the matter.
One of the leaders of this effort, California representative Eric Swalwell joins us now.
Congressman, thanks a lot for coming on.
REP. ERIC SWALWELL (D), CALIFORNIA: Thanks, Tucker, for having me back.
CARLSON: Well, we last talked to you last month and you made the case for this commission and your point was, look, there's a lot we don't know. But there is a lot we do know with the delivery today of this report.
Why would we need your commission?
SWALWELL: Sure. Today, the public report that the White House put out with our intelligence communities made it clearer than ever that Russia attacked our democracy. It was ordered by Vladimir Putin and they intend, and other countries likely, would like to attack us again.
And so I think we owed it to the American people and my colleagues in Congress had joined me in this effort to say let's find out in an independent way what happened, why are we so vulnerable and then make recommendations to sure it never happens again.
CARLSON: So we learn today with the report said in any case that the Russians intended to harm Hillary Clinton. And they believed that she was going to become president and they were gathering information that might be use against her should she win.
So given that and I assume you accept that finding, shouldn't we find out how if they penetrated her server, which strikes me was may be the least protected piece of electronic equipment in the United States so presumably that would be the first step if you are trying to gather information when you go to that server, was not mentioned in the report. I haven't heard any Democrats mentioned that.
If you get this panel, will she be subpoenaed on that question?
SWALWELL: The goal of the panel is, it's a bipartisan effort. Republicans and Democrats want to get to the bottom of the truth. And this is about making sure our elections belong to us. So the committee should have a wide scope and looking at what Russia did to try and undermined and influence our election. So I'm not going to prejudge the results.
Tucker?
CARLSON: OK. But you say -- well, I mean, two obvious points. You say it's bipartisan. Have Republicans signed on to this?
SWALWELL: I have continued to reach out to Republicans, because I don't want just to be seen as trying to --
(CROSSTALK)
CARLSON: It's not bipartisan.
SWALWELL: Well, no, the commission would be bipartisan appointed. It would be Republican and Democratic appointed. I'd still believe that Republicans accept that we were hacked. John McCain held a hearing yesterday accepting that. But I would like to take this out of Congress, depoliticize it and have members fully devote themselves to finding out once and for all what happened because after all, Tucker, the president- elect doesn't even accept that Russia hacked our elections. And so that reinforces the need to have --
(CROSSTALK)
CARLSON: Can I stop you there. I talked about this when we talked before. There's something very disingenuous about you continuing to say you want to take this out of the political world, it's not partisan, when your statements had been entirely partisan. I'm going to read one of them to you right now.
""With the Russia-friendly president-elect taking office January 20th, you said, it's imperative we make sure our citizens are well-informed and our defences are strong.
So the implication is that somehow he is in league with Putin or defences will be weaker if he is president because he is, quote, ""Pro-Russian.""
I mean, that's an entirely partisan thing to say because of course.
(CROSSTALK)
SWALWELL: Tucker, you are a busy --
(CROSSTALK)
CARLSON: .Obama was president.
(CROSSTALK)
SWALWELL: You are a busy guy but you should read his Tweeter feed.
CARLSON: (INAUDIBLE)
SWALWELL: Yes, I know you are very busy, but if you read his Tweeter feeds that --
(CROSSTALK)
CARLSON: I get it. You're telling your views, but it's not honest of you to say they're not partisan or there's no political agenda because of course there is. And it's apparent in what you say.
SWALWELL: Well, it's apparent and what Donald Trump says which is that he admires Vladimir Putin. And so, you know, that is very disturbing.
CARLSON: Well, what does that have to do with any of this? Do you think he abetted -- I mean, OK, yes, sure, he said nice things about Putin. I'm not here to defend it. I don't like Putin, personally, but what does that have to do with penetration of John Podesta's server and his email account?
Do you think that Trump was somehow involved -- what are his views on Russia have to do with this story? That's what confuses me.
SWALWELL: We are less safe as a country because we have a president-elect who does not believe in evidence. And so the American people are seeing our intelligence community undermined by the president-elect.
So I think if you have something taken out of Congress and you have bipartisan experts look at that, hopefully, once and for all, we can sign off on what happened and move on.
CARLSON: OK. So you said that part and then you just said it again that one of the purposes of this is to restore faith in our electoral system and Americans are nervous about whether it's on the level and you want to reassure them that it is.
If that's true, why have you suggested that our voting machines were hacked, and you said it right here, on December 7th, you said the hacking included, quote, ""The scanning of electoral systems in Arizona, Illinois, and Florida.""
You know for a fact that the Russians had -- no foreign government that we know off had any effect on the voting machines themselves and you are implying otherwise? Doesn't that shake faith?
SWALWELL: No. Tucker, you should read the report that came out today.
CARLSON: I did.
SWALWELL: No vote tallies were changed, but three election systems were hacked. And, you know, that should concern us, that they intended to go into election systems.
And I don't want to relitigate the results. Donald Trump is going to be the next president, but for us to be a safer country and secure our democracy, we need to know what happened and assure the American people in a bipartisan way that it won't happen again.
CARLSON: But you conceived that Barack Obama was president when this occurred, right? So you are saying that Trump is somehow making our country more dangerous but it was President Obama who presided over this and presumably left our defense open wide enough that the Russians could exploit them. You don't mention that, I wonder why.
SWALWELL: Tucker, I wish -- I wish we would have done more to stop Russia while they were doing this. And I support the sanctions that are being placed on Russia and it's incumbent upon Donald Trump to make sure those sanctions stay in place and I hope he does keep them in place.
CARLSON: So since you read the report, you must have seen this. I don't think this has even been reported, but it's my favorite part.
You found that the Russian government had run a disinformation campaign against fracking because they are worried about the low-cost of American natural gas, which would of course undercut gas from the state, gas company in Russia.
So environmental groups in this country were taking their cues from Russian propaganda masters. Would they be subpoena, too, do you think?
SWALWELL: This commission would look at Russia's intentions to influence our election. And I don't support anything (INAUDIBLE). I'm like you, Tucker, on this one.
(CROSSTALK)
CARLSON: OK. But, I mean, if Greenpeace comes out and says fracking is dangerous, don't you sort of wonder, well, maybe they got that from the Russian spy masters who are kind of controlling them. I mean, that's what the reports said.
SWALWELL: And if they got that from Russia, they should disavow it now.
CARLSON: All right. Fair enough. Congressman, great to see you.
SWALWELL: Yes, you, too. Thanks, Tucker.
CARLSON: Donald Trump received a 90-minute intelligence briefing today on Russia's hacking efforts during the election. Afterwards, Trump released a statement saying that the country had, quote, ""Absolutely no effect on this election's outcome"".
For more on the report and what exactly it said, we are joined by our chief expert on that, our chief intelligence correspondent Catherine Herridge.
Hey, Catherine.
CATHERINE HERRIDGE, FOX NEWS CHIEF INTELLIGENCE CORRESPONDENT: OK, so it's 25 pages, it's unclassified and I don't think I've ever read a document that's more strongly worded and very definite about its findings.
CARLSON: Yes.
HERRIDGE: And the findings are that this was ordered by Vladimir Putin. The goal was to damage Hillary Clinton. It was to reduce the likelihood she would be elected and then over time, they developed a preference for Donald Trump.
But they also say that their job is not to measure the impact on public opinion. That's something that they can't measure. But, certainly, the propaganda was a campaign on a level that they had not seen before. But what I would say is that you really have to take a document at face value and you have to have a lot of faith in the underlying data, because if you're looking to this review for evidence, there is no evidence here because of exposing sources and exposing methods. So --
CARLSON: Is it usual for a document like this to make claims this concrete about a foreign leader's motives?
HERRIDGE: Right. This is a great question because I was really taken aback by this high confidence on so many of the conclusions. High confidence is like getting an ""A"" or ""A minus"" on a high school paper. It means there's high quality intelligence and there are multiple data points that they put together.
So I've never really seen a document quite like this before. But I would also say I've never seen the intelligence community come out with something that really has the effect of creating a big paper trail that puts a lot of separation between the president-elect and the leader of a foreign country just about ten days before the new president comes into office.
CARLSON: Well, you hate to think there are policy goals behind something like this, but because I implicitly believe everything the government says. I'm not going to ask that.
HERRIDGE: I -- the reason I mention this is that the guidance I had very early on, sort of end of November when this really kind of came to a boil. It's that there really was a concerted effort to create a big division between the president-elect and the Russian president and then also to satisfy a lot of internal anger in the Democratic Party, because the president did not act.
The bottom line is that we can't see the underlying data, but the vice president-elect spoke to reporters within the last hour and he has seen the classified information and he says they are going to take action almost immediately when they come into office.
So that says to me that they felt satisfied by what they read, but it's, you know, it's more complex than just that 25 pages that you can read publicly.
CARLSON: It always is.
HERRIDGE: Yes.
CARLSON: Catherine Herridge, thanks a lot.
HERRIDGE: You're welcome. Sure.
CARLSON: .for your perspective.
Well, ""The Washington Post"" has spent months howling about fake news rigging the U.S. election. Now ""The Post"" has been caught publishing its own fake news once again.
DC's paper of record published a bogus story last week saying Russia hacked the U.S. electrical grid. The story was totally discredited, but not before it's spread across the globe.
Investigative journalists Glenn Greenwald has been spanking ""The Post"" like the battle paper it is.
Mr. Greenwald joins us from Rio de Janeiro, tonight.
Glen, thanks a lot for coming on. So what exactly did ""The Post"" write that was untrue?
GLENN GREENWALD, INVESTIGATIVE JOURNALIST: Essentially the entire article from start to finish. They have this big blockbuster announcement on Friday, which was obviously sensationalistic and would have a huge impact if it were true that Russia and Vladimir Putin had actually invaded the U.S. electric grid by placing malware within the utility system in Vermont.
They induce the governor of Vermont and a Senator Pat Leahy to make this really bombastic statement about how the stud Vladimir Putin was trying to steal the heat to make Vermont suffered during the winter. It turned out that the malware that was found was actually on a single laptop totally unconnected to the grid. Then it turned out that the Russians actually had nothing to do with this malware and then it turned out the one that was on the laptop probably wasn't malware at all. So the story just collapsed one step after the next and the grandest humiliation possible.
CARLSON: Boy, that's really embarrassing. I bet they must have run a front-page correction and the editor Martin Baron must have gone on TV to apologize. Is that what happened?
GREENWALD: The amazing thing is if this was just a one-time case, you know, you could say, well, sometimes media outlets make mistakes.
CARLSON: They do it.
GREENWALD: But this is the second huge debacle that they've had in the last six weeks. Just six weeks ago, they ran this huge story that Russia through this fake news operation had exposed 200 million people to Russian propaganda, a huge story that went everywhere. As it turned out, it was based on a list compiled by a secret group, a new group, that was accomplished only by putting huge sites, mainstream sites like the Drudge Report and various Clinton critical sites on the left, labeling the Russian propaganda outlets. That story collapsed after two weeks. There's a huge editor's note at the top of the story.
Martin Baron, the head of the paper, when the story came out announced it, unveiled it on Twitter. Made a huge deal out of it. When the story collapsed and they had to discount their own source, he said nothing. The paper said nothing. So the story went everywhere. The retraction was heard by a tiny fraction of the people. And we've seen this over and over throughout the last year when it comes to Russia reports.
CARLSON: Interesting. And we've also seen anybody who raises questions about it denounced as a tool of the Kremlin.
Now just to be clear for our viewers, who don't know your background or mine. We have very different politics and have for our adult lives. But I'm interested in talking to you because I think you're totally honest and I don't think you have any other motives. You're not taking money from the government of Vladimir Putin, correct?
GREENWALD: Notwithstanding the fact that I've been accused by that of people like Howard Dean, the former head of the DNC. That is absolutely correct. I am not. And, in fact, you know, you just heard the report that came out today was just another set of repackaged conclusions from the intelligence committee, which may or may not be true that again we are completely unaccompanied by evidence.
And when you simply point that out that the intelligence community keeps just repeating itself over and over with assertions without providing evidence that can evaluated whether or not it's true, that subjects your claim that you must love Vladimir Putin. That you're probably working for the Kremlin, when in fact it's just the basic kind of skepticism that all journalists should be exercising.
CARLSON: So it's -- and is that what animates you? And you're not entirely alone. There are a couple of other people in the traditional left who said, whoa, hold on a second, this is not straight reporting and we got to ask real questions before we accept the conclusions the government hands us.
But, tell me, are you interested in the story because you just think someone's not telling the truth and as a journalist you need to find out why?
GREENWALD: I think, you know, a lot of us came of age. I mean, I started being a journalist and writing about politics in 2004, 2005 and the aftermath of the debacle of the Iraq war, where you know, people were discredited like Judy Miller in the front page of ""The New York Times"" because they were just disbelieving whatever the government was telling them without verifying and asking for evidence. And that led to this disastrous war that killed hundreds of thousands of people.
And also lessons from that and there's lots of examples like that. That's just the most memorable one. I thought the examples we are all supposed to learn from that, which is that we shouldn't accept government claims unless we see evidence that's true particularly when the consequences are so great.
We have John McCain saying Russia has engaged in an act of war. Nancy Pelosi is accusing journalists of being accomplices of Russia who reported on this story, which is basically every media outlet in the country including yours and mine. These are really serious charges and we should see evidence for that.
CARLSON: Exactly. That's just my perspective precisely. Glenn Greenwald, it's really interesting. Thanks a lot for joining us.
GREENWALD: Great to be with you, Tucker.
CARLSON: Thanks.
Coming up, the Republican Party is hoping to repeal Obamacare as soon as President Trump is sworn in. That's what they told you, but it might not happen thanks in part to Senator Rand Paul, who is also paradoxically an opponent of Obamacare. He joins us next to explain what exactly is going on.
CARLSON: Senate Republicans have vowed that their first act under President Trump will be repealing Obamacare, but they met a potential roadblock in Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky.
Paul was the only senator Republican to vote against the budget resolution being use to repeal Obamacare. He says it adds way too much to the national debt and he's trying to get House Republicans on board with stopping it for that reason.
Senator Paul joins us now.
Senator, it's great to see you.
SEN. RAND PAUL (R), KENTUCKY: It's great to be with you.
CARLSON: So I watch your career from the very beginning and I start to look close attention to your presidential run in which you said ""My first act or one of them would be to repeal the abomination, that is Obamacare."" And now irony of irony, you appear to be preventing that.
PAUL: Actually, not quite. As a physician probably nobody is offended by or is against Obamacare more than myself. I've seen it up close. I've seen it firsthand. I'll do anything to get rid of it.
However, I don't want to have to vote for a budget that never balances and a budget that adds $9.7 trillion in debt in order to get to it. What I told my colleagues is, why don't we introduce a good budget? One that balances and then repeal Obamacare?
The way the rules of the Senate and the Congress are, you cannot repeal until you pass a budget. But why does it have to be a bad budget.
We are not getting any Democrats to vote for the budget. This isn't a compromise with Democrats. We're willing to vote for a budget. This is a Republican product. Why should it not be a vision of a conservative budget, of fiscal conservatism? Why should it be a budget that adds so much debt?
CARLSON: I think it's fair question. You also said, though, that we should, and I'm quoting you. We should repeal Obama, but partial repeal will only accelerate the current chaos and it may eventually lead to calls for taxpayer bailout of insurance companies. You wrote that. I understand that reasoning, too.
My question, though, is that Republicans have promised if they were ever to achieve power, both chambers and the presidency to repeal Obamacare right away, why haven't they thought this through?
PAUL: Good question. Here's my point. The same time we vote for repeal and I will vote for repeal, we should vote for replacement on the same day.
CARLSON: OK.
PAUL: There are many ideas about how we would replace this. We should expand health savings accounts so people can save to buy insurance. We should let them buy anything in health savings accounts. We should let them pay for their insurance premiums and their health savings account. They should be able to pay for a diet plan. You should be able to pay for an exercise plan. You should be able for vitamins. You should be able to pay for a vast variety of things.
CARLSON: Well, I agree with that. Every idea you have on this, I just know I would.
PAUL: So do most Republicans.
CARLSON: Then why haven't they come up with an alternative? They've been promising it for years.
PAUL: The speaker of the House said we are going to have a replacement plan within a year yesterday. Really? We've been waiting for six years. Do we not have a replacement plan in order?
CARLSON: So what's the answer? Why haven't they done this?
PAUL: I don't know. I'm putting forth a replacement plan. I put a replacement plan together and it will be next week. I will release a replacement plan. It will involve expanding HSA's, buying across state lines, buying any kind of insurance that insurance companies want to sell, and it will also involve something very important and that's involving expanding healthcare associations.
These are, if you have a pest control business and you and your wife is in a pest control business, you should not be in an insurance full of two people, you should be allowed to associate with --
CARLSON: Right. Of course.
PAUL: If we do those things, the cost of insurance comes down and you get rid of the pre-existing.
CARLSON: Again, I buy it. Everything you just said, but Republicans have control of the entire congress for a while. You just got elected to your second term. You are hardly the most senior guy in the Senate. You have a leadership. They've been telling Republican voters for years they are going to do this.
Why haven't they agreed on a replacement plan until now?
PAUL: Well, here's the thing. There are 50 replacement bills out there that are in legislative language. I met with Congressman Tom Price who's been appointed, you know, to the cabinet, I'm supportive of him. I'm supportive of many of his ideas. Many of the reform ideas that are already in bill form are his.
My point to him and (INAUDIBLE), you have all these bills. Put together a replacement bill and vote on it on day one, but if you don't, the second we repeal it, we're going to be blamed for all of the unravelling of Obamacare.
CARLSON: Exactly.
PAUL: And if -- mark my words, it's going to unravel and unravel even quicker and we are going to be blamed for the bankruptcy of the insurance companies that may come as a result.
CARLSON: But also -- I mean, in my last obvious question is, don't you think promises like this made by Republican candidates seeking office, that they knew they could never really make good on are part of the reason that Republicans voted for Trump in the first place? We didn't believe any Republicans who were already here in Washington.
PAUL: Yes, but I don't know that we can make good on this promises. We could put a good budget for word. We could repeal Obamacare and we could put forward replacement the same day. So I will do this. Next week, I will release a bill that has replacement and I will do everything possible, both publicly and privately to make sure there's a vote on that bill.
I can't guarantee there will be, but I'm telling everybody in my caucus and I'm trying to tell the country, we need to have replacement the same day we repeal Obamacare.
CARLSON: Good luck. Senator Rand Paul, great to see you.
PAUL: Thank you.
CARLSON: Thank you.
Up next, climate change may or may not be up for debate, but temperatures are definitely rising on campus. A Georgia Tech climatologist said she's quitting her job because she can't take the PC atmosphere anymore. It's unethical to science. She joins us next.
TUCKER CARLSON, FOX NEWS HOST: And climate scientists at Georgia tech is quitting because she can't take it anymore. Dr. Judith Curry doesn't deny the climate is changing, but she says the university has become so politicized on the topic. She can no longer handle what she calls the ""craziness"" of it all. Dr. Curry joins us now. Professor Curry thanks for coming on tonight.
JUDITH CURRY, CLIMATE FORECAST APPLICATION NETWORK: Tucker, it's a pleasure.
CARLSON: Well thank you it is for me. You've have written that part of the problem with climate science, not just in your school, but others, is that research money only goes to researchers pursuing certain lines of inquiry and that they're all the same and in fact that prevents good science from happening. Am I mischaracterizing you?
CURRY: Not really, but what you're seeing is this dominant theme of human cause climate change which is where all of the research and focuses is being directed and there is far too little funding and effort going in to understanding natural climate variability. That is my concern.
CARLSON: Right. So, is that, for those of us who are not experts, is that the key debate, not whether temperatures are changing, because of course they always have, but what is over causing that change? And is there a debate on that in your role?
CURRY: Exactly. No one debates, it is clearly warming and it's been warming for overall for several hundred years. The key question is how much of the recent warming say for the last 50 years is been caused by humans. My interpretation of the evidence is that we really can't tell and I don't see a clearer signal that is caused by humans predominantly.
CARLSON: For your position, I think you said we really can't tell. You're sort of open-minded it sounds like. Do you believe you are penalized for that view?
CURRY: I've been vilified by some of my colleagues who are activists and don't like anybody challenging, you know, their big story. I mean I walk around with knives sticking out of my back. In the university environment, I just felt like I was beating my head against the wall and not being effective
CARLSON: What is so curious on it, I live in a similar world, but it is a political world, where people disagree and they have strong beliefs in ideologies. That is sort of the opposite of what I understood science to be is that you are led by inquiry and evidence to conclusions, right?
CURRY: Exactly. University should be places of unfettered research, freedom of investigation, honest and open debate, diverse perspectives et cetera. And in certain fields, you know that are politically relevant, you're definitely not seeing that.
CARLSON: But I mean this is one that has relevance for all of us. The research you're doing, or your colleagues, that ones that you describe as activist are doing, will inform public policy in a way that affects every person on the planet. This takes are really high, no?
CURRY: The stakes are very high. Personally, I think I could have more of an impact outside of the university, in the private sector, sort of free market, and academic freedom.
CARLSON: It let me ask you this, when you hear people who ask the question that you just asked, to what extent is climate change being driven by natural factors that have always existed and to what extent by human activity? People who ask that question are derided as climate deniers. What is your response to that?
CURRY: My response is that really don't know. Humans are contributing something, we don't know how much. From the evidence that I've seen, I don't think that it's the dominant cause.
CARLSON: Dr Curry, you may, you are not listening TV, because 98 percent of science is globally believe one thing. You must be in the 2 percent, right?
CURRY: Ironically, the way the question is framed about the consensus is that yes, it's warming, yes, humans contribute to it. I mean everybody agrees with that, I'm in the 98 percent. It's when you get down to the details that there is genuine disagreement that is really glossed over in the media.
CARLSON: Interesting. We need to do a multipart series on this show on this question. Just, what do we know and what don't we know, as honestly as we can. I hope you'll come back for that. Dr. Curry thanks for joining us.
CURRY: Thank you.
CARLSON: Well straight ahead, British Prime Minister Theresa May is set to visit Unites States in just a few months, but will Donald Trump's affection for political rivals cause a chill in their relations? That is next.
CARLSON: Well here's a something new. A local news report about Amazon's spend happy voice assistant, Alexa, has triggered ironically an even bigger shopping spree. Early this week we told about Alexa mistaking 6-year-old girl chatter for an actual order, going ahead and purchasing a $170 dollhouse and four pounds of cookies. (Inaudible) report a mishap, one San Diego news station said viewers all over the area, complain that their echo device has tried to order dollhouses. Apparently they really were listening to television. The new world has no choice but to obey Alexa if she wants you to buy products on Amazon, not surprisingly.
Time now for ""The friend zone."" we bring you one of our friends within the building her at Fox on to the show. Tonight we are joined by someone we literally could not like more, Janice Dean, co-host of Fox and Friends.
JANICE DEAN, FOX NEWS METEREOLOGIST: Co-host of Fox and Friends, who wrote that?
CARLSON: We just upgraded you. We could talk about it later. No,, who is the weather genius Janice Dean the weather machine and I have a couple questions for you, but I got to start with the weather, because -- what is going on?
DEAN: That is what everybody is talking about. We have cold temperatures that have sunk as far south as the gulf coast and the southeast. We have a raging snowstorm that is happening across the south. Look at the windshield, this is what dangerous here, we're talking about minus 20's, minus 30s, single digits, teens across the south. The stage is set.
We've got cold air in place and a storm system coming out of the gulf, Tucker that is bringing snow and ice to areas that don't typically see wintry weather. So people are freaked out, rightfully so, because a couple of years in Atlanta, Georgia, we have people on the highways for days that couldn't move. So they have taken precautions there. They know they have a big deal, a big storm on the way. And the west, by the way, also getting pounded by rain and snow over the next couple of days, really the most rain and snow that they have seen in some cases in years that could put an end in the drought. So, a good thing, but too much of a good thing could bring flash flooding and concerns across the west.
This is a big deal it's happening across the south as we speak, ice and snow and areas like Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, and the Carolinas. In some cases, Tucker, we could see more of the snow and the Carolinas that we have seen in New York City all season. So this is a big deal and people are taken precautions. The good thing is it's happening on a weekend. It's happening when people don't have to go to work, they have told go anywhere with their kids, they are just hunkered down, because it is a big deal.
CARLSON: At one of those years where anything can happen, including Charleston and Manhattan. So we sent our - I thought I know a lot about you Janice Dean and it is all good. But until our reporters return with their forensic background report they did on you, I didn't know that you were a comedian professionally at one point.
DEAN: No, no, no. I was never a comedian. They have these things in New York City. The funniest reporter, you audition or you, you know, you have actually the videotape?
CARLSON: We have a tape.
DEAN: Is it the comic strip here and New York City, And I won first prize, Tucker can you believe it?
CARLSON: I don't even know, you're such a modest person. You didn't mention that. How did you prepare for this? How did you go from being on TV to being a winner of a stand-up comedy competition?
DEAN: I have always loved comedians and what they do I just want to give it a shot. I love making my kids laugh. You know, on ""Fox & friends,"" I loved to make the audience laugh as well. This is a big challenge. I will say it's one of the most rewarding things I have ever done, because I was so nervous about this and to stand up there and just be raw and just try to make people laugh, I will say, it really was the most challenging thing. But what I did, I took my experience. I talked about what I do with the weather person. The emails that I have gotten over the years, like when I was pregnant, I remember one email saying Janice Dean when you having that baby because you're blocking the State of Mississippi and I need to see my hometown! These are things that actually happen, the weirdest places that I have ever been in the forecast. The doctor's office, the bathroom, that kind of thing and I had some fun with some coworkers as well. I think you have a clip of that.
CARLSON: Here we go.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
DEAN: I've been doing this for a long time, been doing this for ten years. Speaking of being on television, the hair and makeup and things, I mean it takes a lot. It takes a village. You've got to get the hair tease, the hair color, the highlights, the spray tan, the botox, the makeup, the jewelry, and that is just Eric Bolling.
(LAUGHTER)
(END VIDEO CLIP)
(LAUGHTER)
DEAN: I am so sorry Eric Bolling.
CARLSON: I've seen Bolling and end out of makeup in under a minute.
DEAN: I was going to say Geraldo. It's a tossup between Geraldo and Eric Bolling. I love you Eric Bolling, please know I kid because I love. But anyway it was a challenging thing and it to make people laugh, I understand the rush the performers get, comedians get. Working with comedians, they'll say one night you have a great routine and the next night you do the same routine and you won't get any laughs. So, hats off to people who do that. I don't think I'll be doing it again, but I'm so glad I have the trophy in my office.
CARLSON: That is so fantastic. I wish I'd been there. Janice Dean, peeling back layers of the onion and it gets sweeter as you get closer to the core. Thank you.
DEAN: And listen, by the way, congratulations to 9:00. I'm so proud of you.
CARLSON: Thank you. I hope you stay up late enough to come on again.
DEAN: Of course I will.
CARLSON: Deal. Thank you. All right, up next, we got an update on the Fort Lauderdale airport shooting. We are getting new information on that, details stay tune.
CARLSON: This is a Fox News alert. The investigation into the mass shooting, that horrible shooting at Fort Lauderdale airport is ongoing tonight. For more information with the Fox News National Correspondent Phil Keating who is at the scene, Phil?
PHIL KEATING, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Tucker, the airport will remain closed throughout the rest of tonight. No more flights in or out until sometime tomorrow. TVD on exactly what hour of the morning that may be, but for thousands of thousands travelers this is been one trying day. The airport basically went on lockdown around 2:00 p.m., after a second wave of panic which ended up not turning out to be related or actually additional shootings. The only shooting that wounded eight people and killed five people, it happened at 1:00 roughly at the baggage claim area at terminal 2 here at the Fort Lauderdale Hollywood Airport.
Disunited jet behind me, just passing around and pulled up, this is one of several large bodied aircraft that had landed here at the airport when suddenly it was put on security lockdown. They could not get to a jet way. Nobody was allowed to leave the airport property, nobody was allowed to gain access to the airport property, this was all around 2:00 in the afternoon, so presumably, there are a lot of people on that plane who have been stuck out on the Tarmac for the past six hours, because they couldn't get to a jet way to debark the plane. Here comes another one of these planes full of passengers.
You know their miserable. At the people inside the terminals, that I just spoke with, were all now finally being allowed to leave the airport now that for the most part, the airport has been checked square inch after square inch for any further threat that did not materialize. Hundreds and hundreds of people are now leaving terminals one, three, and four. If you have a car in the garage is, you're allowed to go get to your car and drive off the property. A lot of the people who are returning from cruises, the plane got canceled, they're not being allowed to leave the airport, and they are all sending people to the port of everglades where you get on cruise ships to their terminals. They can at least get some food and figure out where they're going to stay for tonight and rebook their travel plans and return home. Absolutely a miserable day, but not nearly as horrible for the families of these 13 shooting victims, back to you, Tucker.
CARLSON: Thanks a lot Phil, I appreciate the update. Coming up next, President Obama is against wall. He was at their means, they can find the human spirit and yet he has decided to build a big fat wall anyway. It's not the Mexican border, it's in D.C. because when D.C sends its (inaudible) there not sending their best, details ahead.
CARLSON: Time now for you choose the news, we put you in the driver's seat. We ask you to tell us what stories we should be covering, but haven't been. This submission comes from Lynn who sent us on twitter. She said she likes to know more about the wall, President Obama's wall. Here's the story. After President Obama vacates the White House in about two weeks, he'll be moving to a rental home in D.C. upscale Kalorama neighborhood, the neighborhood of the people, very rich people. What are builders doing to prepare for his family's arrival there? Well, they're building a wall, of course. TMZ reports that the Obama's are making sure the home is up for the Secret Service by constructing a wall to help keep out unwanted people, poor people, off the property. Walls maybe mean, they may confine the human spirit, but he wants one around his house.
Well, Monday, our segment ""News abuse"" is back. Send your grievous example of media bias or dumbness, of course you have. A ludicrous headline or TV segments, send you evidence @Tuckercarlson, or email us tuckercarlsontonight@foxnews.com That is about it for us tonight, our last show at 7:00. Next week we are at 9:00, the show that his sworn enemy of lying, pomposity, smugness, and groupthink and vain glory. Don't forget to DVR, that counts for ratings and we appreciate it. We will see you next week. The great Bill O'Reilly is up next. See you Monday."
0	11	 12 von 72	Fox News Network	January 6, 2017 Friday	 FOX SPECIAL REPORT WITH BRET BAIER	 6:00 PM EST		"BRET BAIER, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: Panic in a Florida airport. Witnesses say a gunman executed people shooting them in the head without saying a word at the baggage claim at Florida's Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport.
This is a ""Fox News Alert."" Good evening. I'm Bret Baier in Washington.
Tonight, five of those victims are dead and eight more are injured. The suspect is in custody, but not before widespread panic across that airport as people ran from the terminal, lined up outside on the tarmac and reported another active shooter which at this time has been unconfirmed.
Correspondent Phil Keating joins us live tonight from the airport with the very latest on this attack and the suspect behind the massacre. Good evening, Phil. 
PHIL KEATING, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Good evening, Bret. The airport, you can see the runway behind me here at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International remains closed. No planes have landed. No planes have departed for about the past four hours here.
And what is happening at the airport right now is that Broward County Sheriff's Department as well as Fort Lauderdale Police Department officials, as well as any other assistants on the federal level, they are going square inch after square inch of this airport, all of the terminals, all of the baggage claim areas and all of the parking garages, as well as all of the vehicles making sure there are no more security threats here today.
But, they believe by the sheriff here and the FBI is that there was one lone shooter and he is alive and in custody as he has been for the past five hours. His name reportedly Esteban Santiago, and we have new details about him. He served in the Puerto Rico National Guard in 2007. Went with it to Iraq, served there in 2010-2011 and he deployed -- he returned to the Army Reserves and then went to the Alaska Air National Guard where he was released -- with the general released four months ago for unsatisfactory performance.
Now, at 1:00 this afternoon or just thereabout, that is in Terminal 2 baggage claim when suddenly, according to witnesses, Esteban Santiago gets his luggage off the carousel, opens it up, either there or inside the bathroom, then takes his gun out, which you are allowed to fly with domestically as long as you lock it up and declare with the airline, loads it with his own ammunition, then comes out into the baggage claim area and unleashes about 4 minutes of absolute terror and carnage.
Here is how one witness told our Shepard Smith how it all went down.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
JOHN SCHLICHER, WITNESS: I got my first bag off. I heard the first shot, and as I did, the person right next to me fell to the ground. And I wasn't sure -- it was very surreal. I turned and looked and he was holding a handgun, and he was firing into the crowd. Everyone from that flight was standing there waiting for their luggage, and he just started shooting.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
KEATING: In total, 13 people shot, eight wounded, five of those 13 ended up dying. The wounded all taken to local Broward County hospitals. Then there was a sense of getting back to operations. Flight started going up, coming down, landing, taking off, and it appeared that the airport would soon to be back to normal.
But then around 2:00, about an hour after the initial shooting, suddenly it was an absolute chaotic situation, panic, fear, terror. Everyone suddenly started running, scrambling across the tarmac, crossing by foot, luggage at hand going to the north side of the airport as there were reports of additional shots being heard in the parking garages and then in Terminal 1.
So Terminal 1 had to evacuate. People running out of there with absolutely panic looks on their faces. This was not a terror-related shooting according to the sheriff, at least to this point, but everybody was absolutely terrified. The governor flew in. He was briefed and said this was a senseless act of evil.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
RICK SCOTT, FLORIDA GOVERNOR: My heart goes out to every family impacted. The families that lost their loved ones, and the families and the individuals that have loved ones still in the hospital fighting for their lives. We can't imagine how this could happen to any family anywhere in the world, but clearly we don't ever want this happen in our great state.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
KEATING: According to an aunt and a brother of the suspect, Esteban Santiago, who were contented (ph) by ""The New York Daily News,"" they say that after he came back from the Middle East serving over there, ""lost his mind"" and was recently being treated for mental health issues. Bret?
BAIER: Phil Keating, live at the airport there. We'll head back for any breaking details. Phil, thank you.
Now to the other big breaking story today, the U.S. Intelligence Community officially is blaming Russian President Vladimir Putin for ordering a campaign to influence the U.S. election and hurt Hillary Clinton's chances of becoming president. It's all part of an unclassified report by the Intelligence Community released today after officials briefed President- elect Donald Trump with declassified version.
We have Fox team coverage tonight, Senior National Correspondent John Roberts joined us live from New York outside Trump Tower with Mr. Trump's response to the Intel briefing.
But we begin with Chief Intelligence Correspondent Catherine Herridge on what we're learning from this report. What jumps out at you, Catherine?
CATHERINE HERRIDGE, FOX NEWS CHIEF INTELLIGENCE CORRESPONDENT: Well, Bret, I think in the decades that I've been covering this area. I have never seen a document that is so definitive and so strongly worded and where the key judgments or the top line conclusions are all at the high confidence level. I mean, the intelligence world, that means it' an A or an A plus. So it's high quality intelligence and there are multiple sources. So I've never seen something quite so definite and also so strongly worded.
BAIER: Yet so vague as far as specifics. Now, maybe that falls under classified parts. But, this particular document doesn't have the backup.
HERRIDGE: The unclassified report was never going to have a lot of details about the sources and methods. So you have to take a lot of it on faith that the underlying data is there. What I would say is that Donald Trump was briefed today and he's now announced that he's going to take aggressive action as soon as he comes into office. So that tells me that he felt satisfied with the quality of the information.
And just to remind people, the findings are that the Russian president ordered an influence campaign to impact this election with the goal of hurting Hillary Clinton's chances and then also helping Donald Trump.
But if you look at the full screen here, it also tells you that at a certain point, Moscow understood that they had not succeeded. The report says, ""When it appeared to Moscow that Secretary Clinton was likely to win the election, the Russian influence campaign began to focus more on undermining her future presidency.""
So even the Russians understood or believed that whatever information they put out had not significantly influenced public opinion.
BAIER: So that's the motive and intent that they get to.
HERRIDGE: Correct.
BAIER: But as far as they make clear that it does not affect the vote tally or the actual election.
HERRIDGE: Yeah. I thank you for raising that, because I think there's been a lot of misconception about what these hacks really meant. This report makes clear as to the testimony on Hill yesterday that was never any evidence that the Russians got inside voting machines and impacted the votes themselves, the ballots themselves.
And they also say in this report, it was not their job to assess how this impacted public opinion and whether it changed voters' minds. Some of the opinion polls suggest that it was not a big factor for Americans, but it is something that we really can't say.
BAIER: And now you have President-elect Trump, Vice President-elect Pence saying they're going to go hard after cyber attacks.
HERRIDGE: Yeah. And, again, that tells me that they felt the classified data that they saw today was gave them confidence that they need to take action in the future.
BAIER: Catherine, thank you.
HERRIDGE: You're welcome.
BAIER: The president-elect got his much-anticipated intelligence briefing today, as we mentioned, over the hacks leading up to the November election. Afterwards, President-elect Trump issued praise, gave a promise, and acknowledged Russia's role in the cyber attacks.
Senior National Correspondent John Roberts is outside Trump Tower tonight with more in today's meeting. Good evening, John.
JOHN ROBERTS, FOX NEWS SENIOR NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Bret, good evening to you. In the run of today's briefing, Donald Trump had been publicly very skeptical about Russia's possible involvement in the hack of the DNC server. But after spending 90 minutes with the chief of the intelligence agency, the chiefs of the intelligence agencies, Donald Trump seem to give a tacit acknowledgment that Russia was at least trying to hack the Democratic Party.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
ROBERTS: It was a who's who of the Intelligence Community at Trump Tower today, the Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, CIA Director John Brennan, the FBI's James Comey and (inaudible) Mike Rogers from the NSA.
Following the 90-minute briefing, Trump said ""Had a constructive meeting and conversation with the leaders of the Intelligence Community this afternoon."" Trump agreed Russia, China, and others are trying to hack us. He firmly asserted, ""There was absolutely no effect on the outcome of the election including the fact that there was no tampering whatsoever with voting machines."" Trump acknowledged, ""We need to aggressively combat and stop cyber attacks. And said he will appoint a team to give me a plan within 90 days of taking office.""
But before Trump even met with the briefers, he was venting his frustration that portions of the classified reports were leaked to a news organization yesterday. Trump tweeting, ""I am asking the chairs of the House and Senate committees to investigate top secret intelligence shared with NBC prior to me seeing it.""
In an interview with ""The New York Times"" today, Trump pointed fingers at Democrats for trumping up the whole issue of Russian hacking saying, ""They got beaten very badly in the election. I won more counties than Ronald Reagan. They are very embarrassed about it. To some extent, it's a witch hunt. They just focus on this.""
We're learning more tonight about retired CIA Director James Woolsey's departure from Trump's team. The senior transition official denied it had anything to do with Woolsey being concerned about Trump possibly restructuring the intelligence agencies saying, ""Woolsey was never really part of the team and that he was upset that he was never interviewed for any intelligence, DOD, or ambassador jobs."" Here's how Woolsey himself put it to Megyn Kelly.
JAMES WOOLSEY, FORMER CIA DIRECTOR: I didn't feel i was misrepresented, but I was not really called upon to, you know, go to meetings or participate in work on the transition.
ROBERTS: Trump's transition team was also pushing back today against reports General James Mattis isn't happy about staffing choices at the Pentagon. Sources tell Fox News it's nothing more than the ordinary griping by subordinates. But Transition Communications Director Sean Spicer tweeted, ""Great transition at DOD. Reports to contrary completely false.""
Trump's proclivity to use Twitter to send political messages do a sharp response from Vice President Joe Biden. Speaking to PBS, Biden took aim at Trump's reference to Senator Chuck Schumer as the head the clown in the Democrats efforts to preserve ObamaCare.
JOE BIDEN, U.S. VICE PRESIDENT: Grow up, Donald. Grow up. Time to be an adult, you're president. You've got to do something. Show us what you have.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
ROBERTS: Trump is pledging to show the Democrats exactly what he has, but not until he takes over the presidency on the 20th. And back to the Intel report, Donald Trump is also warning today against the sort of leaking classified information that happened yesterday with that report, saying, ""The methods, tools, and tactics were used to keep America safe should not be a public discussion that will benefit those that seek to do us harm."" Bret?
BAIER: John Roberts, live outside Trump Tower. John, thank you.
It is official now, Mr. Trump will be the 45th President of United States. But the normally routine process to certify the Electoral College votes to declare Donald Trump the winner was anything but routine today. Chief Congressional Correspondent Mike Emanuel has that story tonight from Capitol Hill.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
MIKE EMANUEL, FOX NEWS CHIEF CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Vice President Joe Biden while presiding over a joint session of Congress confirms Donald Trump as the 45th President of the United States.
After a hard fight 2016 election, House Democrats tried protesting the results in 10 states won by Mr. Trump, but no Senate Democrats joined in, and Biden had to gamble them down.
PRAMILA JAYAPAL, (D) WASHINGTON REPRESENTATIVE: Mr. President, the objection is signed by a member of the House but not yet by a member of the Senate.
BIDEN: Well, it is over.
EMANUEL: Preparing to take power, there are also discussions about Congress authorizing money to carry out one of President-elect Trump's major campaign promises, building a wall on the southern border.
Two weeks before inauguration day, Mr. Trump blasted one of his favorite targets on Twitter. ""The dishonest media does not report that any money spent on building the Great Wall for sake of speed will be paid back by Mexico later.""
Those working on the transition rejected any suggestion that this will be breaking a promise.
KELLYANNE CONWAY, TRUMP SENIOR ADVISER: Obviously a centerpiece of Donald Trump's successful campaign was, ""I'm going to build the wall and have Mexico pay for it."" That hasn't changed. But Congress is examining ways, obviously, to have the wall paid for -- through their auspices, and then Mr. Trump is making the point, the president-elect is making the point that he will have Mexico pay it back.
EMANUEL: One idea being floated is Congress could authorize the money and then fees charged at the border would repay the taxpayers. But those types of promises are frequently made in Washington and critic say rarely kept.
RAND PAUL, (R) KENTUCKY SENATOR: I'm a fiscal conservative and to me the debt is the most important pressing problem of our country and that I can't give up and believing that the debt is a problem.
EMANUEL: As Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi today sounded skeptical.
NANCY PELOSI, (D) HOUSE MINORITY LEADER: Be interesting to see that the Republicans would put about $14 billion in a continuing resolution to build a wall? I don't know. That, I think that's a heavy sell. I think that's a tough sell for them.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
EMANUEL: There are growing concerns from fiscal conservatives about the cost of the upcoming agenda. Building infrastructure, border security, and repealing ObamaCare without a replacement. Expect calls from them to see the impact on our debt first. Bret?
BAIER: Mike Emanuel, live on Capitol Hill. Mike thanks.
Several state and local governments across the nation could be in danger of losing federal funding over immigration laws. Congress has introduced a bill that would hold funds going to so-called sanctuary cities. And as this map from the Center for Immigration Studies shows, there are about 300 places that could be in danger of losing a lot of federal dollars. Don't see the map, but trust us, it's there.
Correspondent William La Jeunesse reports from Los Angeles tonight on the impact this bill could have on places from San Francisco to New York.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT-ELECT: We will protect American lives. We will cancel all federal funding to sanctuary cities.
WILLIAM LA JEUNESSE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Problem is, under current law, he can't. A bill introduced, Thursday, buy Congressman Lou Barletta would change that.
LOU BARLETTA, PENSSYVANIA REPRESENTATIVE: So this will give the Justice Department the teeth, the tools they need to put in end for this once and for all.
LA JEUNESSE: 300 cities currently refused to cooperate with detainer requests from immigration and customs enforcement. Meaning, illegal immigrants accused or convicted misdemeanor or a felony are shielded from deportation because there's nothing an existing law that obligates a city to cooperate and nothing to penalize them if they don't.
ERIC GARCETTI, (D) LOS ANGELES MAYOR: We're saying that the good and law- abiding immigrants of Los Angeles, our family members, our friends, our neighbors, they belong here and we will fight for them.
BARLETTA: Mayors do not have that right. They do not have the right to pick and choose what laws they want to enforce.
LA JEUNESSE: Especially in immigration law. When Arizona passed a bill mandating immigration enforcement that was tougher than a federal standard, the Obama administration argued the U.S. can't have 50 different policies and the Supreme Court agreed. That ruling could now come back to haunt sanctuary cities.
RAHM EMANUEL, (D) CHICAGO MAYOR: To be clear about what Chicago is, it always will be a sanctuary city.
LA JEUNESSE: Barletta's bill would stopped for at least one year all federal funds to any city that refuses to cooperate with ICE.
BARLETTA: They would not get one federal cent.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
LA JEUNESSE: Barletta's bill dramatically escalates the cost to sanctuary cities. Currently, the only face a minor risk of losing some federal grants, not billions in high way, medicaid and education money. Now, twice before this bill never made it out of committee, this Congress promises to be different. Bret?
BAIER: William, thank you.
And now as promised to look at that map, about 300 places that could be in danger of losing a lot of federal dollars according to the Center for Immigration Studies. I knew we had it.
We came within a half point of hitting the 20,000 mark on ""Wall Street"" today, but at last it was not to be. Today, the Dow jumped to an all-time high, nearly hitting the magic mark after more than a month of teasing, but closed below the milestone after losing some momentum this afternoon.
The Dow closed up 65 points, disclose as you see, 19,964. The S&P 500 was up 8. The NASDAQ closed up 33. For the week, the Dow was up 1 percent, the S&P 500 nearly one and three quarters percent and the NASDAQ was up 2.5 percent.
The rally on ""Wall Street"" came after a December jobs report showing that wages jumped by the largest amount in seven years, however, 2016 finished with lower than expected hiring numbers.
The U.S. added just 156,000 jobs in December, sending the unemployment rate to 4.7 percent from a nine year low of 4.6 percent. Though the rate remains at a healthy level, the number of people who are not working or still looking for work remains at prerecession levels.
It was an issue that caused a national uproar in North Carolina. Now, at least three other states, including Texas, are looking at banning transgender people from using the bathroom of their choice. Texas' lieutenant governor unveiled the proposal, Thursday, saying, ""It will be a top proposal for the state legislature in Texas.""
Tonight, Correspondent Casey Stegall reports from Dallas on the proposal that critics argue could cost the state millions of dollars.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
CASEY STEGALL, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Protests at the state capital in Austin following newly proposed legislation that would mandate which public restrooms a person must use in Texas.
DAN PATRICK, (R) TEXT LT. GOVERNOR: It's going to be a tough fight.
STEGALL: Senate Bill 6, better known as the Texas Privacy Act will be introduced after the state legislature reconvene next Tuesday. If passed, the law would require residents to use public bathrooms or locker rooms based on the gender listed on their birth certificate. Republican Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick claims its intent is to protect citizens.
PATRICK: The privacy and safety of Texans is our first priority, not political correctness.
STEGALL: However, critics argue this goes far beyond just being P.C., flat out calling the proposed measure, discriminatory.
CHUCK SMITH, EQUALITY TEXAS: If we're seriously interested in protecting people and trying to stop predatory behavior, then the target of the legislation should be predators. The target of the legislation should not be transgender people.
STEGALL: Opponents also points to the economic fallout in North Carolina after that state enacted a very similar bathroom law last year.
CHRIS WALLACE, TEXAS ASSOCIATION OF BUSINESS: PayPal, Deutsche Bank, CoStar that are pulling jobs and plan investments from North Carolina. We do not need that here.
STEGALL: Droves of businesses, entertainers, and sports organizations boycotted North Carolina saying they won't support communities that discourage equality. The Texas Association of Business says if that happens here, the state could lose more than 100,000 jobs and up to $8.5 billion. But Lieutenant Governor Patrick has called their bluff.
PATRICK: We know we're on the right side of the issue. We're on the right side of history.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
STEGALL: Speaker of the Texas House, Republican has suggested this issue is not top priority in the upcoming session. This has lawmakers in Kentucky and in Virginia considering bathroom bills of their own. Bret?
BAIER: Casey, thank you.
Up next, the president's record on race relations. First, winter weather have (inaudible) for some of our Fox affiliates around the country tonight. Fox 46 in Charlotte, North Carolina's governor issued a state of emergency to the Tar Heel state today as the south prepares for a winter storm this weekend. Forecasters say snowfall totals could range from 1 to 9 inches depending on where you live. We're expecting about one here in D.C.
And these are live look from Fox 12 in Portland, Oregon, the big story there tonight, also the weather. The National Weather Service has issued a winter storm watch that will begin Saturday morning and last through Sunday night for the area. Forecasters expecting 2 inches, Saturday, before it turns to freezing rain and sleet into Sunday. It could get messy this weekend. That's tonight's live look outside the beltway from ""Special Report."" We'll be right back.
BAIER: Four black people charged with a hate crime in the video taped beating of a mentally disabled white man in Chicago made their first court appearance today. The judge asked the four suspects today in court where their sense of decency was and order the four suspects held without bail for the attack broadcast live on Facebook.
The bidding of the white man by black assailants highlights another incident of racial strife in the nation. One that President Obama contends is actually gotten better under his tenure. Correspondent Kevin Corke takes a look at race relations under the Obama administration.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
KEVIN CORKE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: It was a remarkable juxtaposition. Days after authorities were made aware of a Facebook video showing a vicious hate crime involving black suspects and a white victim in Illinois, President Obama confidently said the state of race relations in America is improving, telling the local ABC affiliate in Chicago, ""I promise you, for the most part, race relations have gotten better.""
But better is subjective. From the racially attempt shooting of Trayvon Martin, to the massacre of nine church goers in South Carolina carried out by a self (ph) white supremacists and the murder of five Dallas police officers who died protecting demonstrators who themselves are protesting a series of police involved fatalities. Race relations in many of America's communities is threadbare.
BARACK OBAMA, U.S. PRESIDENT: I'm here to insist that we are not as divided as to we seen, and I know that because I know America. I know how far we've come against impossible odds.
CORKE: Incidents involving race have help to both shape and ignite the national conversation, and not just the controversial variety, like his now infamous ""Beer Summit"" involving Henry Louis Gates and the Cambridge police officer who arrested him after an altercation at the Harvard professor's home.
OBAMA: The Cambridge police acted stupidly in arresting somebody when there was already proof that they were in their own home.
CORKE: Critics accused the president of being tone-deaf after those comments. The White House official say there's a reason to remain optimistic.
JOHN EARNEST, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: The fact that you see people of a variety of races speaking out on these issues with one voice appealing to the same kinds of values gives the president a lot of optimism that these are problems that can be resolved.
CORKE: Sentiments echoed by civil rights leaders like Jesse Jackson.
JESSE JACKSON, CIVIL RIGHTS ACTIVIST: Deep water does not drown you. You drown because you stop kicking. Don't stop kicking and keep (inaudible) where you're trying to get to.
OBAMA: The bible calls us to hope, to persevere and have faith in things not seen.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
CORKE: Emotional and poignant words there by the president after the devastating shooting in South Carolina, Bret, where even after eight years in office, the emotional gap between what the president obviously believes and how a great many Americans still feel is cavernous even tonight. Bret?
BAIER: Kevin Corke, live on the North Lawn. Kevin, thank you.
A Republican congressman took matters into his own hands today removing a high school's controversial work of art from a wall in the U.S. Capitol. The painting depicted police officers as pigs. It was on display among other submissions to the Annual Congressional Art Competition.
California Congressman Duncan Hunter removed it and returned it to Missouri Congressman Lacy Clay, who authorized its display after it won his annual art competition in May. Clay's office has not responded to its removal.
Republicans plan to repeal ObamaCare, and that will be no easy task. But with the GOP and controlled Congress, they are hedging their bets and adding in legislation to strip Planned Parenthood of federal funding. Last time around, it was a losing battle, but as Chief Washington Correspondent James Rosen reports, this time it could have a different outcome.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
JAMES ROSEN, FOX NEWS CHIEF WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT: 11 words from House Speaker Paul Ryan reignited a major battle on Capitol Hill.
PAUL RYAN, HOUSE SPEAKER: What Planned Parenthood legislation would be in our reconciliation bill?
ROSEN: That means congressional Republicans will use the ObamaCare repeal effort as a vehicle for stripping Planned Parenthood, which carries out some 325,000 abortions a year of roughly 400 million in medicaid funding the group receives for its other services such as contraception and cancer screening.
PELOSI: We will fight that decision by the speaker to defund Planned Parenthood. And, you know what, the American people are with us.
ROSEN: Republicans and pro-life groups say the funding will go to local health care providers that steer clear of abortions. The congressional budget office estimates the cuts would impact 400,000 women.
CECILE RICHARDS, PLANNED PARENTHOOD: They don't come to Planned Parenthood to make a political statement. They come because they need high quality affordable care and we're proud to provide it to them. And for many of them, we are their only health care provider.
ROSEN: A similar effort by Republicans one year ago ended with a veto by President Obama. Among other promises to pro-life groups, President-elect Trump pledged in writing in September to defund Planned Parenthood, but just six months earlier, he was talking like this.
TRUMP: Look, Planned Parenthood has done very good work for some -- for many, many -- for millions of women. We're not going to fund as long as you have the abortion going on at Planned Parenthood and we understand that, and I've said it loud and clear. But -- and we'll see what happens.
ROSEN: Still, pro-life advocates expect the next president to make the defunding and his other pledges a reality.
MARILYN MUSGRAVE, SUSAN B. ANTHONY LIST: We got those in writing, a letter from him, and we are looking forward to him holding good to his pledge to defund Planned Parenthood and redirect those monies to facilities that will provide comprehensive health care for women.
(END VIDEOTAPE)
ROSEN: Polls show most Americans do want women under certain conditions to have access to abortions, but one in five voters according to the November exit polling cited Supreme Court nominations as their number one issues, and such voters went heavily for Donald Trump who promised to appoint pro- life justices.

BRET BAIER, FOX NEWS HOST: James, thank you.
Russia was a big topic of discussion for Secretary of State John Kerry today. National security correspondent Jennifer Griffin sat down with the outgoing secretary to ask you why if he knew Russia was trying to influence the elections didn't he say so publicly before the election.
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
JENNIFER GRIFFIN, FOX NEWS NATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT: Secretary of State John Kerry has had more contact with the Kremlin than any other U.S. official in the past four years as he tried to engage his Russian counterpart whom he badly need to secure international agreements. But that relationship couldn't stop what U.S. intelligence chiefs say is not the first time the Russians hacked into a U.S. election. There were attempts prior to this summer.
And now some former members of the Obama administration say the president should have tried to stop the Russians sooner.
LEON PANETTA, FORMER CIA DIRECTOR: Frankly, I think President Obama should have acted much earlier during the summer when we have the first information that this was going on.
GRIFFIN: Former CIA director Leon Panetta said this morning that President Obama should have taken action last summer when it first became evident that the Russians were trying to hack the U.S. election. He said it was an attack on our country. Why didn't you take action then?
JOHN KERRY, SECRETARY OF STATE: The president did take action by, in fact, making it public, and he reserved the right at that in time to take action that he felt was appropriate when it was appropriate.
GRIFFIN: But it didn't stop? It didn't --
KERRY: It diminished. I think the important thing is that the American people are made aware of what was happening.
GRIFFIN: When President Obama first took office, he asked its team to reset relations with Russia.
Is Russia reset possible with Vladimir Putin at the helm in Russia?
KERRY: What I have found is that we were able to cooperate on a number of issues of importance to the United States where we got good results. We managed to cooperate on getting chemical weapons out of Syria. We had Syria's cooperation in Russia and engagement on the Iran nuclear agreement negotiation.
GRIFFIN: So in effect, could Trump's friendly approach to Russia, in fact could it be the answer to better relations?
KERRY: Not if it is just giving them what they want and walking away and not achieving something.
GRIFFIN: It is not clear what Kerry achieved with Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov in Syria. In December the State Department praised Russian ceasefire efforts, but Defense Secretary Ash Carter who has watched the Russians establish military bases in Syria for the first time since the cold war cast doubt on the U.S. ability to work with Russia. Quote, ""Russia has been explicitly thwarting the U.S., done nothing to defeat ISIS, doubled down on the civil war."" With two weeks to go as secretary of state, Kerry says his work is not done.
Would you consider a run in 2020?
KERRY: I am not planning elected office, but I am not ruling out any possibility of what I might or might not do in the future.
(END VIDEOTAPE)
GRIFFIN: In Washington, Bret, that could mean just about anything. Back to you.
BAIER: Jennifer Griffin live at the State Department. Jennifer, thank you.
The intelligence community issues an unclassified report saying Russia's Vladimir Putin ordered the hacks pre-election to help Donald Trump. Our panel weighs in with their own assessment and findings next.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
NANCY PELOSI, (D-CA) HOUSE MINORITY LEADER: It was really quite a stunning disclosure.
JOHN KIRBY, STATE DEPARTMENT SPOKESMAN: It is pretty obvious that they were certainly trying to hurt Mrs. Clinton and their efforts. That's clear.
KELLYANNE CONWAY, TRUMP CAMPAIGN MANAGER: They simply can't show the nexus. Why would Russia want Donald Trump to bring back a presidency? Donald Trump is going to increase the defense budget. He's going to modernize our nuclear capability.
SEN. TOM COTTON, (R) ARIZONA: All the claims like fake news and Vladimir Putin and Jim Comey are mostly crying over spilled milk.
BOB CORKER, SENATE FOREIGN RELATION COMMITTEE: The Russians are really good at this. We don't want France's elections to be affected. We don't want Germany's elections to be affected.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
BAIER: Well, the intel community has put out an unclassified version of this report. We're going to get to that. The classified version was briefed to president-elect Donald Trump.
Here are some of the highlights from this report that was put out. ""We assess Russian president Vladimir Putin ordered an influence campaign in 2016 aimed at the U.S. presidential election. Russia's goals were to undermine public faith in the U.S. democratic process, denigrate Secretary Clinton and harm her electability a potential presidency. We further assess Putin and the Russia government developed a clear preference for president-elect Trump. Moscow's influence campaign followed a Russian messaging strategy that blends covert intelligence operations such as cyber-activity with overt efforts by Russian government agencies, state- funded media, third-party intermediaries, and paid social media users or trolls. We assessed with high confidence that Russian military intelligence used the Guccifer 2.0 persona and DCLeaks.com to released U.S. victim data obtained in cyber operations publicly and exclusives to media outlets and related material to WikiLeaks. DHS assess that the types of systems Russian actors targeted were compromised were not involved in vote tallying. We assess Moscow will apply lessons learned from its Putin ordered campaign aimed at the presidential election to future influence efforts worldwide including against U.S. allies and their election processes."" I wanted to take the time to read the highlights from the report.
Let's bring in our panel, Charles Hurt, political columnist for ""The Washington Times,"" we welcome Edward-Isaac Dovere, chief Washington correspondent for ""Politico,"" and syndicated columnist Charles Krauthammer. OK, Isaac, your thoughts on this and how it has been perceived?
EDWARD-ISAAC DOVERE, CHIEF WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT, ""POLITICO"": Well, we have a statement from the president-elect that seems to take the presentation seriously, more seriously than he had been taking it from the tweets that he had been putting, statements to this point. But what we don't have is any clear acceptance from him of the assessment from the intelligence community. It seems like at least his team is continuing to question it, and we have a statement from him and then from the vice president-elect saying that they will be taking new action once they are in office. But it doesn't change with the 17 agencies put together with what they are saying is very high certainty here of Russia's intent and Russia's role in the influence of the election.
BAIER: Charles?
CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER, SYNDICATED COLUMNIST: I think Trump understands that the fight he is in is a losing proposition. He is in what should be the honeymoon period of his presidency. It is supposed to start when he is sworn in. It is supposed to be anticipated, and most presidents start with a wind at their back.
He has been so involved in so many issues with so many tweets that it is as if the marriage has already started. And this is not something he can win, because they are so many Republicans who are concerned about the intelligence and who don't want to denigrate it or to diminish it. So I think his statement today was a good one, we had a good meeting. He didn't say I accept or don't accept, but he basically said I take it seriously enough and will order an investigation for 90 days, a general one into cyber attacks. We are going to be tough on this. That's fine.
He needs for this debate to stop. It could continue about the details about what the Russians are doing here and Germany and France and elsewhere is, but it should not be Trump versus the world. It sort of reminds you of when he got into the fight with the gold star parents. It's one you can only lose. It's a personal one, and I think he understands he has got to let it go which I think he is doing, and that is very smart to do.
BAIER: He also praised in that statement, as Isaac mentioned, the intelligence community, the men and women who protect the nation.
House Speaker Paul Ryan issued a statement. ""Russia has a track record of working against our interests and they clearly tried to meddle in our political system. I strongly condemn any outside interference in our elections which we must work to prevent moving forward. We must also be clear that there is no evidence that there was any interference in the voting or balloting process. We cannot allow partisans to exploit this report in an attempt to delegitimize the president-elect's victor. Donald Trump won this election fair and square because he heard the voices of Americans who felt forgotten."" That is House Speaker Paul Ryan. Charles?
CHARLES HURT, POLITICAL COLUMNIST, ""WASHINGTON TIMES"": It is a strong statement and probably one that needs to be made because clearly a lot of people, partisans are trying to conflate the two.
Another thing I thought was very interesting in addition to what Charles said about Donald Trump's statements, he and Mike Pence tend to go aggressively after the cyber espionage, which I think is a smart thing to do because it means that he's taking it seriously. But in addition to that it also sort of reveals -- it reminds everybody what a bad job, apparently, the current president has done over the past eight years in combating cyber espionage by not only by the Russians, but the Chinese, Iranian, and who knows what other enemies that have infiltrated American cyber-security.
BAIER: Isaac, how far do Democrats push this? How much does this issue dominate ahead of the inauguration?
DOVERE: We have two weeks left until the inauguration. It seems like there will be some more discussion of it. But I think what is important here is that it's not just Democrats that are raising this. You have John McCain and Lindsey Graham continuing to push this.
We don't know how far we are going to go in the discussion of whether they should be a special committee set up to investigate these hackings and not just what happened but the report, as Charles just mentioned, goes into 2008 and 2012 and activities that have happened all throughout.
The public part of it is not getting so much into that, but there is more information about that that our intelligence agencies seem to have, and we will see whether there is a bipartisan effort. I think that will change it. If it is just Democrats that are questioning it, then it does become Democrats versus Donald Trump.
BAIER: But it is a short jump for Democrats to make that this is not a legitimate election because the voters were somehow influenced by all this information. Are they going to make that jump? We haven't heard anybody say that explicitly.
DOVERE: So far many of them who have been talking publicly have been very careful not to make that jump. We will see how that goes as this sets in. Since election night, whenever that was, about 10:00, 10:30 p.m. on election night when it became clear that Donald Trump was actually going to be president, you see this slow process of ingesting it and internalizing it, or then coming off of the acceptance, rejecting it. And so I think you will see as we get closer to inauguration day more Democrats who start to get a little more publicly uncomfortable with what is going on. And going forward from there they may try to carry this in that sort of way. But it is tough because they don't want to politicize this, they don't want to make it a partisan thing. They want to try to make this about the real issue of the Russia --
BAIER: They tried today to change the electoral votes, to challenge them for various reasons, and it didn't happen, and Donald Trump will be the 45th president of the United States.
KRAUTHAMMER: All of the attempts are pathetic. The attempt today to change the Electoral College vote, the recounts that were ordered by Jill Stein joined by Clinton in those states, this is all a joke. I think Republicans, particularly Trump, have made a mistake of overestimating how widespread is the notion that this was a rigged election and that Putin put his thumb on the scale. That you hear from left wing partisans. It is not a generally accepted idea. The intel reports explicitly says we have nothing to say on this. It is a partisan left-wing meme, and it isn't going anywhere. Ignore it is the best strategy that Republicans ought to take.
BAIER: Can Donald Trump stay off Twitter on this issue and ignore it and move on?
HURT: I don't think he sees any reason to. I think he sees it as a very valuable tool. Look at what happens every single day. He sets the agenda of what people talk about. He may pick the wrong thing, but he does set the agenda.
BAIER: Like the ratings for ""The Apprentice"" under Arnold Schwarzenegger? You like that one?
HURT: I thought it was vitally important.
BAIER: Next step, the Friday lightning round.
BAIER: This is a FOX News alert. We have a late update on that shooting from the Fort Lauderdale Airport, five dead, eight wounded, getting some more information from law enforcement sources telling our own producer Matt Dean close to the investigation that the gunman, the suspect, Esteban Santiago, visited the FBI office in Anchorage, the field office there, in November. We're told Santiago visited the office to tell agents that U.S. intelligence had infiltrated his mind and were forcing him to watch ISIS propaganda videos.
These sources tell FOX that Santiago appeared agitated and incoherent during that interview, clearly indicating he was suffering from some kind of mental condition, although it's not clear what. FOX is told Santiago did make mention of a deployment to Iraq during his conversation with agents in Anchorage. The FBI is investigating on a number of fronts in a number of cities. We know he had time with the Puerto Rico National Guard as well as with the Alaska Army National Guard. Again, five dead, eight wounded as that investigation continues at this hour.
We are back now with the panel for our Friday lightning round. Our first topic, Charlie, Planned Parenthood, it seems like this is back on the chopping block for Republicans.
HURT: Yes. And this is why Americans hate Washington, because we are not talking about the legality of abortion one way or the other. We are talking about the use of taxpayer funds by people who think abortion is murder to perform abortions. And that is a wholly separate issue. And the fact that it is even debatable here is pretty stunning.
BAIER: But the pushback, Isaac, will be significant.
DOVERE: Certainly, and I think that is not the only question here. This is one of those moments where you see Republicans who voted to defund Planned Parenthood in the past when it was not an issue that would go forward because they knew that Barack Obama would veto it, some of those more moderate Republicans or who have political consequences that they might face for defunding Planned Parenthood, it will be a question of whether they still vote to defund it now that it would be a real thing and that presumably Donald Trump would sign that.
BAIER: Another social issue, Charles, bathroom bills. We are now in a number of states considering what North Carolina did about this transgender choice of bathroom, Texas among them.
KRAUTHAMMER: This is one of the most bizarre issues one can imagine. This is now the premier civil rights issue in America. The population that it applies to is minuscule, but now it has become elevated because of the public way in which the NBA and other big institutions have punished North Carolina for passing a bill of this sort.
The government ought not to be in this business in the first place, and to the extent that state governments or even local can restore the status quo, which is what we've always understood, you use the bathroom that is appropriate to your gender, does that, I think it ought to be left alone. But it has been seized by the left as somehow the premier LGBT civil rights issue, and it is a way of showing your bona fides. I think it is a pity it has come to this. Reasonable people ought to be able to agree on this. But this is no longer in the realm of reasonable people.
BAIER: All right, let's talk about race relations, what the president said in the wake of the incident in Chicago, hate crime. Here is what he told a local affiliate there.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
BARACK OBAMA, (D) PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I promise you, for the most part, race relations have gotten better. But I think what we have seen over the last several years when it comes to the tensions between police and communities, the Internet, the horrific hate crimes of the sort that we appear to have seen --
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What is your reaction?
OBAMA: It is terrible.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
BAIER: That statement, that race relations have gotten better specifically.
KRAUTHAMMER: I think the president is deluding himself. But I do think we're on sort of a constant trajectory, whether it had been Obama or somebody else, we would be where we are. The idea that he would magically alter that course I think was always a mistake. But I think it is true that if you look at the generation, my son's generation, compare it with mine, the attitudes are totally different. This is really a generational issue. It is not going to change as radically as it did on gay rights, but it is one that will change in time, and it changes every year for the better. But if you measure it year by year, it looks rocky and not constant.
BAIER: Remember we started President Obama with the beer summit and the Cambridge police officers. We had a lot of incidents in between there, and now this.
DOVERE: It has been one of the most frustrating, difficult issues for Barack Obama as president in part because he knows that no matter what he says on any of these issues when it happens it becomes a lightning rod issue. He can't ever make everybody happy. Either he's saying too much or he's saying too little or he's attacking the police or he's not standing for fellow African-Americans.
I think Charles is right on this. Year-by-year things look worse overall, you do see a trajectory going in a certain direction. And it does seem like it is changing. Perhaps Barack Obama does deserve a little bit of credit for that that we'll only see 20 years from now, children who grew up thinking of a black man being president.
HURT: But if it does continue to improve as it has generationally, it will not be because of Barack Obama. He had an extraordinary opportunity when he came into the White House to really seal the progress that had been made in this country and he failed and we'll always regret that.
BAIER: Next step, this week's winners and losers.
BAIER: Thanks for letting us into your home tonight. We have the winners and losers with the panel. Charlie?
HURT: The winner of the week or for a much longer period of time than that is Congress Sam Johnson. He fought in two wars, a true hero, picked up every battle award you could possibly get, spent seven years in the Hanoi Hilton, announced he is retiring today after 25 years of service to the third district of Texas.
My loser of the week is, of course, Hillary Clinton, who officially lost today and is so desperate, the Clinton Foundation is so desperate for influence they're actually floating the idea of her running for mayor of New York.
BAIER: Winner then loser.
DOVERE: I would put the winners of basically every appointee that Donald Trump has for the cabinet, Scott Pruitt, Steve Mnuchin, Jeff Sessions, people who might be controversial, who are controversial to a lot of Democrats, but who are going to be clips of attention with everything going next week as they head into their confirmation hearing.
And losers, the intelligence committee. It seems quite demoralized by the attacks that they have been getting on their work by Donald Trump.
BAIER: Winner and loser?
KRAUTHAMMER: Winner, hands down, Tucker Carlson given the 9:00 slot on FOX. It's not just that he's great and he deserves it, but he is the definitive proof that Leo Durocher was wrong, nice guys do sometimes well. And he is a living example.
The loser is the House GOP. They're trying to sneak through in the dead of the night abolition of the independent ethics office, a way to kill a real issue where you have the merits by doing it in the dead of night and by stealth. Cosmically dumb.
BAIER: That is it for SPECIAL REPORT. Fair, balanced, and unafraid. Tucker is up next, who is winner."
0	12	 13 von 72	Fox News Network	January 6, 2017 Friday	 THE FIVE	 5:00 PM EST		"ERIC BOLLING, THE FIVE SHOW CO-HOST: Hello, everyone. I am Eric Bolling. And this is a Fox News alert. We're following two breaking news stories. Five dead and eight injured in Florida after a shooting at a Fort Lauderdale airport. Plus, just in this hour, U.S. intelligence agencies have released an unclassified version of the Russia hack report. We'll have all the details on that in a moment.
But first, back to the tragic story out of Florida. A shooting suspect is in custody after a lone gunman opened fire in a baggage claim area in Florida's Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood international airport, shooting some people in the head without saying a word, investigators say. A witness described seeing the gunman opened fire.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
JOHN SCHLICHER, WITNESS TO SHOOTING: I got my first bag off when I heard the first shot. And as I did, the person right next to me fell to the ground. And I wasn't sure, it was very surreal. I turned and looked and he was holding a handgun. And he was firing into the crowd. Everyone from that flight standing there waiting for their luggage, and he just started shooting.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You said he reloaded and began shooting a second time?
SCHLICHER: Yes, he did.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Did you get a good look at him? How would you describe them? Short, tall, anything?
SCHLICHER: He was probably close to 5'10"", 6', a slender man, dark hair, and probably what I saw most was the gun.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Young, old?
SCHLICHER: Pardon?
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Young, old? What age would you guess?
SCHLICHER: He was probably in his 30s.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Did he appear to be with anyone? Did he say anything?
SCHLICHER: He did not say a word and he was not with anyone that I saw. My wife took something for my mother-in-law bought and applied pressure to the gentleman who was right next to us. He had been shot in the head, and all the people who had been shot in the head.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
BOLLING: And moments later, the witness described the panic as a second scare unfolded live in the air.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: There have been reports there are some shots fired in the garage. And they are locking us down again. They said that somebody is in the garage. Right now, they just said that seconds ago.
(CROSSTALK)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: They told everybody to get on the floor. Michelle, get down. They told everyone to get down. Oh, oh, God, everyone lie down on the floor between the carousel. We are down the ground. We're down on the ground.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Stay down.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: They said that there is something going on outside in the garage. People are crying now, people are scared to death.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
BOLLING: Phil Keating is on the scene. Now, Phil, a lot breaking, a lot happening in the last half hour or so, bring us up to speed.
PHIL KEATING, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Well, the reported name of the alleged gunman, the lone gunman, according to the sheriff of Broward County, a man who acted alone here at the Fort Lauderdale airport on the deck below me here at terminal 2 baggage claim, the shooting happening, you just heard that eyewitness described the carnage and the absolute terror, and that was about two hours of panic here, especially after they were then reports of gunshots heard in one of the parking garages. And then, there were reports of gunshots inside terminal 1, adjacent to terminal 2 on my right shoulder, and that sort of one over there. And that led to everybody fleeing. The people who were already inside the airport at their gates awaiting for their departures, they then pouring out of the jet way's down the stairs onto the tarmac, and eventually all the way across the major east-west runway here at the Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood international airport, to the furthest part of the airport property, furthest away from the terminals, as you can possibly get. And for two hours, there was absolutely a sense of terror and panic and people that were frightened and scared. No one knew exactly what was going on. Heavily armed law enforcement were running all over the place.
The state of the airport operations right now is this. It remains closed. As you can see, the runways are motionless. The only thing moving down there are some ambulances and some airport vehicles. There is a helicopter flying around, we see a black hawk helicopter doing circles around the airport property up there. That is law enforcement. It is not international guard here in the state of Florida. So no planes taking off, no planes departing. It has been this way since at least about 2 o'clock. There was a short period after the initial 1:00 p.m. shooting and killing of five people and wounding of eight others where planes began taking off and landing again. And then there was that a second wave panic and uncertainty. And so, the airport has been shutdown every sense.
Terminal 1 remains evacuated. There are hundreds of suitcases strewn all over the terminal, as everyone ran full sprint out here out to the curbside, and they remain out there outside terminal 1. Terminal 2 over here, there still remains some people, probably hundreds if not thousands of people in there who have not been allowed to leave. What is happening at the airport right now is, I believe, we have a second camera broadcasting live back to New York on the activity inside one of the parking garages here. You can see that the law enforcement, Broward sheriff's department, assisted by ATF as well as Fort Lauderdale police and FBI going car to car to car. It like I'm looking right now at a soldier up there or a law enforcement officer. You want to pan up there, Mike?
Yeah, you can see what they are doing. They're going through every square inch of this airport right now. They are checking every car, they're checking every crevice inside the terminals, and there are four terminals here. This is a very busy airport. Not nearly as busy as Miami international, but part of the three south Florida airports, Miami, Fort Lauderdale, and West Palm Beach, there is a lot of air traffic every single day. It is now the heavy winter tourist season. And so, there are a lot of people backed up here. But the airport is not yet reopened. Go ahead, Eric.
BOLLING: Phil, I want to bring you around. But very quickly, earlier, it was reported that this gunman checked his gun in a bag, picked the bag up, pulled the gun out of the bag, loaded it, and started firing. Is that still accurate?
KEATING: That is still the prevailing theory that is widely being reported out there. Several officials with government agencies are saying that appears to be what happened. Initially, the report was that the man, the gunman, who has been named Esteban Santiago, the alleged gunman, flew on an Air Canada flight, landed here at terminal 2, which serves Air Canada as well as Delta, and then had checked his weapon with a military ID. So you are allowed to check a weapon and fly, but you have it, check the bag. Then he lands here in Fort Lauderdale, goes to baggage claim, down here below me and terminal 2, he raised his gun, goes into the bathroom, apparently loads the gun. And according to the witness that was interviewed by Shepard Smith, he then comes back out into the baggage claim area and just starts shooting people at point blank in the head and in their bodies, blood everywhere. And according to that witness, he emptied his gun, reloaded it, and then started shooting again. And then, when law enforcement here at the airport, which is primarily Broward County sheriff's department, when they responded and started yelling commands at the guy, he offered no more resistance, and then just sat down. He was arrested, handcuffed, taken off for questioning, in custody at the sheriffs department or perhaps an additional location right now because of the severity of the situation, as terror is still being investigated as a possible motive. The sheriff of Broward County said he still couldn't comment whether he thought it was terror related. But in general, people here today were in a great state of terror.
BOLLING: All right. Greg, next question.
GREG GUTFELD, THE FIVE SHOW CO-HOST: Do we know for a fact that the suspect was on that flight and where were his victims on that flight or was it a specific flight in general?
KEATING: Yeah. It is still unclear. The initial reports that people were going with was he was on the Air Canada flight. Air Canada checks this guy's name. Then they put out a statement saying there was nobody on any of our flights today by this name, nor did any of our incoming flights to Fort Lauderdale have any passenger that checked a weapon when they checked into the original airport. And so, it is now believed that this alleged gunman, a lone gunman, acting alone, with the belief of the sheriff and the FBI boarded a plane to Alaska, then connected in Minneapolis, Minnesota, and then continued on to Fort Lauderdale, landing shortly before 1:00 p.m., and then in the baggage claim area unleashing a wave of carnage. Eight people were wounded by the gunfire. They are still being treated at the local hospitals here in Broward County. And there should be an additional statement tonight, a news briefing update by the sheriff, we would expect, before the 10:00 and 11:00 local newscast here in the Miami-Fort Lauderdale market.
Any second now, Governor Rick Scott will be coming before the microphone. He flew down from Tallahassee today. He has been briefed at the airport, and he is just running a little late for his planned 4:45 news conference. Now, it is supposed to be 5 o'clock. And clearly, he is not quite yet onsite. But we are expecting that to happen sometime, any second now.
BOLLING: KG.
KIMBERLY GUILFOYLE, THE FIVE SHOW CO-HOST: Hi, Phil. We are wondering then he has a background, but here we have some information regarding his criminal record. And he has something down four minor traffic incidents, an eviction. What is interesting to me, as a former prosecutor, is that in January of 2016, charged with two misdemeanors, one count of fourth degree assault and another for damage of property over $50. And apparently, the genesis of that was a domestic violence incident where then he entered a deferred prosecution program by completing certain requirements. The case was then dismissed by the state prosecutor. So that wasn't but a year ago. Do we know anything else about the background, the nature of that particular crime, about who victim might have been, because interesting that he has a weapon here?
KEATING: Yeah. Details are still hard to get regarding the past personal life of this alleged gunman here. The domestic we had heard about a couple of hours ago, and it appears that the domestic violence victim, who we would presume would be a girlfriend or a wife of this suspect, decided didn't want to participate with the continuation of pressing of charges, so the prosecutor dropped it. But that was a year ago. There are reports that he was in the army at some point. The big question now is what was the motive here? Is this a sympathizer to terror? Is this somebody who may have had some sort of personal beef with somebody or life in general, maybe PTSD. Everything is on the table. No one has gotten any better details on that from law enforcement, but they do have the shooter alive in custody, not wounded. Law enforcement did not fire a single shot here today. All of the bullets were fired by the suspect.
Again, 13 people shot, five of them have died create, a very sad day here at the Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood international airport, which remains closed at this time. Everybody who was stranded here outside on the curbside check or as well as inside terminal 2, at least outside, I guess I can speak to that. No one has had any water or any food for several hours here. And people are starting to come up to us asking if we had any water. Unfortunately, we don't either. Everyone is hoping this airport gets cleared, secured, declared safe, and normal airport activities get back and operations up and running here sometime in the near future.
BOLLING: Dana Perino.
DANA PERINO, THE FIVE SHOW CO-HOST: Hi, Phil. Do they have any reason to believe they need to continue the search through the parking lot or is that a precaution? And my second question would be about the evacuation plans of the airports. Obviously, no one can plan for every single thing, but in terms of your experience of covering disasters and tragedies, how do you think that the airport fare?
KEATING: Well, it was absolutely a jam packed traffic jam bottleneck. We took a back route into the airport, from the south side on Griffin Boulevard. The main -- often the distance behind me, the main way to get into the Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood airport is you take and I-95 and then you connect to the East-West 595. And that is the main three lanes, four lanes coming into the airport. That was an absolute parking lot, and it was eventually closed. And that was -- people were stuck in their cars and they couldn't go anywhere, because you're moving less than a-mile-an-hour. The people that were here at the airport had already been dropped off or had gotten out of ground transportation, taxicab or service to get on their flights, well, they are stuck here. There is nowhere to go. You can't get out of here. No one is allowed to move until this airport is checked, every square inch.
Let's take another look at some of these fatigue-wearing law enforcement officers. They are out there, like I said, checking every single truck, every single car, making sure -- look, they are looking in the bed of this pickup truck right now, making sure there are no explosive devices, anything that is a security flag. Nothing will be left uncovered here today. Every square inch is being pored over. So this is going to take a while. It is a large piece of property. But this airport has been on lockdown for quite some time, and you would think there they are at least more than halfway done going through everything. But they want to make sure no one is suspicious, and there is nothing suspicious to be found before they declare the airport can reopen.
BOLLING: We are going to stay with you. Governor Scott about three minutes away, we are hearing. We are going to stay with you until we hear from him. In the meantime, Juan has a question.
JUAN WILLIAMS, THE FIVE SHOW CO-HOST: Hi, Phil. Very interested in the idea that he was seen wearing this blue Star Wars t-shirt, 26 years old, Esteban Santiago. The question I have is, are you allowed to transport the bullets with the gun?
KEATING: That is a very good question. I suppose you would be. To get the clearance by the airline to check your gun -- and hundreds will do this all the time. I don't believe they are required to pack their hunting gun or rifle or handgun for that matter then be required upon landing to have to go get ammunition to use the weapon. So I don't know that for a fact. The FBI and the ATF as well as the sheriff as well really would not get into absolute meticulous details of the investigation during the last briefing.
(CROSSTALK)
WILLIAMS: No, but I was interested in, Phil -- I was interested understanding the law. It came as a surprise that you can transport a gun because it would open the door to this kind of incident where somebody then takes a gun inside the security perimeter, and even if they were met by an associate or a colleague, then the colleague could bring the ammunition, and maybe that is what they were worried about in terms of the garage, that there was someone who is going to meet Mr. Santiago and who would have exacerbated the circumstance with explosives, further ammunition.
KEATING: But the suspect did not go into the security area -- in other words, did not go through TSA with the weapon. The weapon was reportedly checked in his luggage, checked in at the front counter.
PERINO: Right.
KEATING: He then got his boarding pass and then went through security and then flew via Minneapolis from anchorage and then landed here in Fort Lauderdale, walks out -- goes down to baggage check, gets his bag from the carousel, then goes into the baggage, the guys goes to the bathroom and loads it up.
PERINO: Right.
KEATING: So presumably -- here comes the governor, by the way, coming up with his entourage here. But that is the prevailing theory of what exactly happened, Juan.
BOLLING: And, Phil, one thing we should point out, is at the baggage claim area, you left the security area of the airport already. I mean, so anyone technically can come and bring bullets, a gun, whatever at that point.
(CROSSTALK)
BOLLING: Let's just see here, the governor is coming. He is on his way to the podium. Let's take a listen to what he has to say, Phil.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
RICK SCOTT, FLORIDA GOVERNOR: All the right. The first thing I want to tell you is we will not tolerate acts of evil. You just can't imagine how this could ever happen in a state like ours. Think of the innocent lives that are lost. We still have -- according to the sheriff's department, we have five, as you know -- we have five individuals that have lost their lives. We still have people fighting for their lives in the hospitals. Whoever is responsible will be held accountable to the full extent of the law. Let me repeat this. The state of Florida, the citizens of Florida, law enforcement in this state will not tolerate evil acts. Whoever is responsible will be held accountable to the full extent of the law.
I heard about this when I was in Fort Myers. I made it became over here, got over here about 1:45. I stayed in contact with the sheriff's office, Sheriff Israel has done an outstanding job, the FBI. Everybody involved has done an outstanding job. There has been complete coordination between the sheriff's department, the airport security, all federal agencies, everybody has worked together. I reached out across the state, I acknowledge our National Guard to make sure they were ready, if there is any need for the National Guard. But also, everyone across the state, major airports, we will make sure whatever resources they need, the state was available to provide those resources.
My heart goes out to every family impacted, the families that lost their loved ones and the families and the individuals that have loved ones still in the hospital fighting for their lives. We can't imagine how this could happen to any family, anywhere in the world. And clearly, we don't want this to happen in our great state. I have reached out to president-elect Trump and spoken with him and vice president-elect Pence multiple times to keep them informed. And they told me whatever resources that we need, they would do anything in their power to make that happen. My number one priority right now in Florida is to keep everybody safe. Everybody that lives in our state, everybody that travels in our state, do everything we can to keep them safe.
As you know, this is an ongoing investigation. There is a lot of information that law enforcement will put out at the time they can put out, and they will do that as quickly as they can. But I tell you, everybody is working hard to find out exactly what happened and to hold whoever did this accountable. I don't ever want this to happen again to any family anywhere in the world, but clearly, never again in our great state. I'd be glad to answer any questions anybody has.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: How did you get here?
SCOTT: How did I get here?
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes.
SCOTT: I flew into executive airport.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Did they need to provide security for you? (Inaudible).
SCOTT: I believe so. I came here as quickly as I could, stay informed, make sure that whatever resources the state needs, we provided. I made sure that the sheriff knew that, the airport knew that. But on top of that, I did that for airports and sheriff's departments across the state on top of talking to our National Guard to make sure they are ready.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: What information do you have on the gunman?
SCOTT: This is an ongoing investigation. All that information will be released through the sheriff's department at the appropriate time.
(CROSSTALK)
SCOTT: Say again please.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (Inaudible).
SCOTT: We don't have details right now, but that will be released at the appropriate time. Right now, the biggest thing to do is to pray for them. We went through pulse. The biggest thing is to pray for those individuals that ended up in the hospital, pray that every one of them survived.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Have you spoken with President Obama?
SCOTT: I have not spoken to President Obama.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Has he reached out to you?
SCOTT: No, first of all, he has not reached to me. I talked to vice- president Pence -- president-elect Trump and vice-president-elect Pence quite a few times, just to keep them informed.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Did you reach out to (inaudible)?
SCOTT: I have not.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: (Inaudible)?
SCOTT: This is an ongoing investigation. The sheriff department will release information as quickly as they can.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Has president-elect Trump (inaudible)?
SCOTT: I reached out to president-elect Trump and vice president-elect Pence.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (Inaudible)?
SCOTT: Absolutely.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (Inaudible) resources?
SCOTT: I have a personal relationship with vice-president Pence and president-elect Trump. And I reached out.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Any other questions?
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: (Inaudible)?
SCOTT: It is horrible what happened here. It is not a time to be political. It is time to mourn for those who lost their lives, finish the investigation, and pray for everybody that is still fighting for their life.
(CROSSTALK)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You mentioned pulse, now another incident that (inaudible)?
SCOTT: Just remember, this is a simple act of evil. We are going to hold whoever did this accountable. Not time to do politics. It is a time to -- remember, we have an active investigation. Finish the investigation, mourn for those who lost their lives, and pray for those who are still fighting for their lives. Thank you, everybody.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
BOLLING: OK. So that was Governor Scott. I did notice, KG, that he mentioned he has spoken to Donald Trump today and he have not spoken to the president of the United States yet.
GUILFOYLE: I'm not sure what's going on with that. But it is important to be communicating with both of them to make sure that they are fully apprised of the circumstances and the details. You see that he is really reluctant to kind of, you know, go any further until they have the rest of the information regarding the shooter, the background, regarding motivation, and intention here, if there was anything else associated with this. And so, we are probably waiting for those developing facts.
WILLIAMS: I am surprised like Eric. I mean, you want the military -- you want to check this guy's background. You want to find out what the government knows about him, so it would seem you want to go to the man who is the president and you want to go to homeland security as well as to the U.S. military offices. I see in my notes it says that his name has been put through all of the military databases. So, you know, Rick Scott, the governor, says he doesn't want to play politics. This is such a thing, it is almost like you know there are two presidents. It is weird.
BOLLING: Well, do you think President Obama will contact Rick Scott?
WILLIAMS: I think Rick Scott said he reached out only to president-elect Trump.
(CROSSTALK)
BOLLING: He said Trump reached out to him. Trump said he left his briefing.
GUTFELD: Yes.
BOLLING: Intel briefing. And he reached out to Governor Scott. They said --
WILLIAMS: That's what I heard.
BOLLING: So your thoughts and what we heard from Governor Scott?
GUTFELD: Well, I'm just curious about whether this is terror or not, a terrorist's life always goes down with the ship, and this guy didn't go down with the ship, he gave up.
GUILFOYLE: He sat down.
GUTFELD: He sat down. At the same time, there is some fishy stuff. It is all speculation. So what can you say, you know?
BOLLING: Dana, your thoughts on the response so far?
PERINO: Well, I think in regard to having communication to with the federal government, whether he talked to the president or the president- elect, if the governor were asking for federal resources, of course, he would need to talk to the president of the United States. As he said, he has a personal relationship with Trump and Pence. Until he needs federal assistance, I don't think that matters.
BOLLING: OK.
(CROSSTALK)
WILLIAMS: We agree. I think you've got to go right now or you have resources, Dana, the resources with United States government.
(CROSSTALK)
GUILFOYLE: But they are being checked.
WILLIAMS: Like Greg said, if this is a terrorist incident.
GUTFELD: I didn't say that.
(CROSSTALK)
WILLIAMS: No, what you said committee suggested that it could be. We all lived in fear in this country of terrorist-inspire or terrorist-led activity of this kind of sort. If that is the case, let's get the government involved.
(CROSSTALK)
BOLLING: No doubt. Phil, can you weigh in a little bit? Juan points out that -- first of all, the Navy came out first and said, we don't have anyone by that name in our database.
(CROSSTALK)
GUILFOYLE: Army, National Guard.
BOLLING: And so, the other armed forces are weighing in. If he does have that military ID, do we know which branch of the military he claimed to be a part of?
KEATING: It appears to be army, because -- whether he served active duty in the army, that is unknown or at least unconfirmed. Thanks to my colleague, our colleague, Jen Griffin. She said that the director of public affairs for the Alaska National Guard confirms that the alleged shooter here at the Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood airport, Esteban Santiago, was a member of the Alaska army national guard until August of this past year, 2016, when he was given a quote, general discharge. Nothing beyond that at this point, but there could be a more detailed lengthy statement coming soon as well.
PERINO: Can I talk?
BOLLING: Go ahead, Dana.
PERINO: I'm just saying that we have a message here that says the brother of the man who has been tentatively named as the suspect says the suspect was receiving psychological treatment while living in Alaska. This is Brian Santiago, a report out of Alaska.
BOLLING: Phil.
KEATING: Possibly this shooter just completely snapped when he got here. Everything is on the table at this point. And the sheriff, the FBI, the Miami chief -- the division chief, they are standing with the governor there. Basically only the governor spoke, didn't provide any new information regarding what he might be divulging during his interrogation, which you can only imagine is continuing at this hour. And he has been in custody since basically 10 minutes after 1:00 p.m. this afternoon.
GUILFOYLE: I just think that we also have to get more information regarding the general discharge and especially this report that Dana just mentioned about having some psychological problems. All right. Well, joining us more with airport security is former deputy TSA administrator Tom Blank. Thank you for joining us, Tom. So developing situation here with information coming out as they were able to pull some forensics, do some database searches, determine the background of this individual and what his intent might be. How do you see this going?
TOM BLANK, FORMER DEPUTY TSA ADMINISTRATOR: I think in some ways that it is a validation of the way that airport security has been developed over the period since 9/11. Every airport has an airport security program. It is administered by TSA, but it defines the roles and responsibilities of everybody who is in law enforcement, who has first responder capabilities in the area. It would be different for every airport. And what we saw this afternoon was that the airport security program unfolded with the ceiling of the perimeter. That is a good thing. Then they isolated terminal 2 where the threat was, the shooter was. It wasn't long until they had him in custody, and then they began to evaluate and secure what threats might be present in other parts of the airport. Obviously, it is a tragedy because of the loss of life, but this appears to have been well coordinated, which is what Governor Scott just said.
GUILFOYLE: We have a couple of questions for you, take it around the table. Juan.
WILLIAMS: Mr. Blank, I'm very interested, I see you're described as one of the founding fathers of the TSA. I, as a frequent traveler, am surprised that really, counters, ticket counters, baggage claim areas are not secured. That doesn't make sense to me.
BLANK: Well, it's a matter of finding the right balance between being able to process and have some degree of convenience in the air travel system and also the proper degree of security.
The logical implication of your question is that we would conduct screening before individuals ever got to the ticket counter, which would cause very serious logistical problems in terms of slowing things down if we did it on the perimeter of airports as vehicles, taxis and so forth, entered the airport.
So there are ways to evaluate the threats that might be present from observations, through cameras and that sort of thing. So the risk is reduced, but we still are able to have some degree of freedom of movement and not wind up in a situation where going to the airport requires a four- hour advance -- advance arrival.
WILLIAMS: One follow-up on that is what about the gun, that people are allowed to transport guns and apparently ammunition and then load in the bathroom. Again, to me, this seems like, boy, that's a big hole.
BLANK: Well, it's -- it's actually a pretty solid system where you declare your weapon. It has to be contained in a locked case approved by TSA. The baggage screeners are aware of it. They look for it as the baggage is being screened. Sometimes they will double check it.
And I think, Juan, the question becomes, is, if you didn't allow people to travel with weapons, and you remove those weapons from the baggage claim area, how much more secure is the baggage claim area? And that's a good debate to have. But obviously, the baggage claim area, as open as it is, would be subject to someone simply walking in the front door with a gun.
BOLLING: Sir, we talked about this exact thing happening in Turkey, when the terrorist walked into the front of the airport and before they got to the secure area started firing away, killing people, mowing them down. I mean, we're just talking about money now, aren't we? Aren't we just talking about having every airport in the country secure, as Juan points out, the ticket area and the baggage area? It seems like we have to be willing, at this point, to spend the money versus having more incidences like this.
BLANK: This is -- this would be a good debate to have as to whether or not we do need more security on what I'll term the public areas of the airport.
But I think the real question is, when you have 450 commercial airports in the country, you're seeing 2 million passengers a day, 18 million pieces of checked baggage. How much inconvenience, additional security, additional screening will the American people tolerate before they begin to just say, ""Look, my freedom of movement is so hampered that I'm just not going to fly anymore""?
GUILFOYLE: Interesting. Dana, you have a question for Mr. Blank?
PERINO: Yes, sir. A question for you about, I guess it's a state prerogative, but I wonder if the federal government and the TSA had ever taken a position on it, either when -- from when you are serving there or later. And that is, apparently, Florida was going to take up a question in their statehouse next week, asking the question, should guns be allowed in the airport? So as they -- as you're coming in to pick somebody up, et cetera.
Has the TSA has ever taken a position on that, or do they leave it to the states?
BLANK: Well, the TSA would not take a position on a state firearms measure. But some states do put additional restrictions on weapons that are carried into the airport in terms of declaration, in terms of being able to inspect them, in terms of being able to find out whether or not they're an illegal weapon or a properly registered weapon.
TSA would not interfere with -- with any states that wanted to put these additional restrictions on carrying a firearm into an airport.
GUILFOYLE: All right. Greg, you have a question?
GUTFELD: To me anyway, Mr. Blank, this seems like another example of when you -- once you harden other targets, the soft targets become visible. We harden all these entrances at large airports, but we forget about the exits of smaller airports.
What would you do? What would suggest? You know, if you have family and relatives going to these airports, what would you like to see changed?
BLANK: Well, I would like to see overall additional capability to do intelligence-based risk assessments. We have some of that now with secure flight, where we do background checks, a certain amount of background checks against the no-fly list, against phony Social Security numbers and things -- and things like this. Maybe more enhancement of identifying a phony I.D. at the checkpoint would help.
I would definitely close down the -- what I call the side entrances to airports. I don't think we look hard enough at airport and airline employees who come to work, access the secure areas but don't go through the -- don't go through the checkpoints.
So I think there are definitely things that we can do to make the envelope tighter, and those are some of the things I'd start with.
GUILFOYLE: So let's just take it a step further here, because you talked about this. It was an interesting debate about the public areas of the airport. I mean, to your knowledge, when was the last time there was a comprehensive, you know, study done or some kind of meeting or consensus on what measures we can take? And I am certain there will be some hearings after what has transpired here, because this seems to be -- you know, a gaping hole.
BLANK: Well, I think that's -- I think you're probably right. You know, the studies that are done are probably -- come in the form of checks and attempts to penetrate the system from the General Accounting Office, from the various inspectors general and from TSA itself, to see where the -- where there are gaps that you can possibly get weapons, prohibited items through. So that's going on, on a constant basis, reported to Congress and elsewhere on a regular basis. And but it's obviously kept secret so the bad guys don't find out.
It is very likely that most airport lobbies in this day and age by this time are under camera surveillance, and you probably have people in command centers who are doing some observation for what might be defined as suspicious movements through the airport or suspicious behaviors, so that there could be that kind of a response from visual surveillance.
GUILFOYLE: All right. Excellent. And Tom Blank, thank you for joining us here on ""The Five"" today. Former deputy TSA administrator, referred to as founding father of the TSA.
All right. So Juan, we want to discuss this a little bit further. We can talk about it at the table.
WILLIAMS: You know, I'm so interested. I don't know that this happens very often in our country, thank God. But I read that the last time we had such an incident was 2013 in Los Angeles, and there, a TSA officer was killed.
But in general, this is an exceptional event, given all of our hardening of our targets and, of course, the airports. You know, maybe we should stop for a second and say this might be just an outlier.
BOLLING: We got lucky this time, I mean, believe it or not. One of the -- Fort Lauderdale Airport, it looks crowded there, but not a big, major hub, not a big airport. If this guy wanted to -- you know, I don't know if he just lost his mind. You know, because if you wanted to create a lot more mortality, wanted to kill more people, you could go to any one of the airports.
GUILFOYLE: But this is still the 22nd busiest.
BOLLING: But here's the point. Here's the point. They're just Every baggage claim -- next time you fly, pick up your bag, look at the people who are walking in and out. You don't know if they are crazy, packing heat. Listen, I am saying -- when you're in the airport, wants to talk about creating terror, that is the place to do it. Think about your emotions when you're going through the airport. You want to get to your place. You want to get to your flight. You're stressed out. I mean, that's...
WILLIAMS: By the way, I think it is a major airport.
GUILFOYLE: It is a -- it's 22nd busiest.
WILLIAMS: Yes, I think that's a big -- and I attempted once going through there, and boy, it is packed with folks going on cruises, because a lot of the cruises go out of there.
BOLLING: But it's not at La Guardia. It's not, I mean, we're talking, you know ...
WILLIAMS: You're right.
BOLLING: ... big airports.
PERINO: OK, well, we have a FOX News alert. Just moments ago -- just moments ago a declassified report on Russia hacking our election was released. The report states that Vladimir Putin ordered a, quote, ""influence campaign"" aimed at undermining the 2016 election, specifically towards Hillary Clinton.
Catherine Herridge has spent the last hour digging through the new finding, and she joins us now.
Catherine, can you get us up to speed on this other breaking news story today?
CATHERINE HERITAGE, FOX CHIEF INTELLIGENCE CORRESPONDENT: So I've been through the report. BOLLIt's about 25 pages, Dana. And in my 15 years of covering this beat, I have never read a report that is so strongly worded and is so definitive.
The report has a series of key judgments. These are the major findings of the investigation, and it says that they are at the level of high confidence. And if you are grading the intelligence, that would mean they're giving it an ""A"" or an ""A+."" That means that there is high-quality intelligence; there are multiple sources of intelligence that lead them to their conclusions.
And their main conclusion is that this was a operation that was ordered by the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, to influence the American election, to undermine our democracy, to hurt Hillary Clinton's chances of winning; and then over time, they came to want to root, if you will, for Donald Trump. That became their favored candidate.
So those are the main headlines, and they say the intelligence is at the level of high confidence. So this is like an ""A+"" in the intelligence world.
PERINO: All right. We're going to take it around the table here.
HERRIDGE: Sure.
PERINO: Greg, you had a question?
GUTFELD: Yes, I was looking at, on page 11 of the report, and -- and what -- the reasons why Putin directed this. A lot of it had to do with -- it always feels like they're slighted. In this case, it was over the Olympic doping scandal and the Panama papers.
HERRIDGE: Right.
GUTFELD: It's like -- I don't know Putin or Russia understands that we were not responsible for those things that happened. Yet, is that really true that that is what drives Vladimir Putin to do these things, is that because of the doping scandal shamed them, we're going to come back and undermine their electoral system, their election system?
HERRIDGE: Well, a big piece is pride for the Russians, like with a lot of these leaders. And also buried in the report, you probably saw, too, Greg, is that it was kind of payback against then-Secretary Clinton for 2011 and 2012, when he publicly blamed her for instigating demonstrations in his country against him after these parliamentary elections that were deemed to be not democratic.
But if you also look deep in the report, I want to emphasize to people that there's a very interesting finding, and it basically says that they wanted to hurt Hillary Clinton, but at a certain point they realized they felt she would win. And at that point they decided to change the focus of their operation to gather information that would hurt her future presidency.
And it reads in part -- just one second here -- ""When it appeared to Moscow that Secretary Clinton was likely to win the election, the Russian influence campaign began to focus more on undermining her future presidency.""
So the Russians didn't feel their campaign had been successful in damaging her chances of winning, and at a certain point, they decided to take the information they had and try and leverage it against her in the future.
PERINO: Catherine, I want to take it around. I'm going to ask you a quick one, since I didn't get a chance. This -- you're reading from an unclassified report that was released. And Nancy Pelosi, the House minority leader, has said she wishes that the American people could get more of the details. Do you have any insight as to what is in the classified document that would be different from the information you have now?
HERRIDGE: OK. So this unclassified report really has absolutely no backup data about sources and methods. And critics will use this as a way to say that the intelligence community politicized this report, and they're hiding behind protecting sources and methods by not releasing the information.
The other side of the argument is that this is the kind of information that, if it becomes public, they can't afford to burn or destroy those sources.
But reading the unclassified report, you've got to take a lot on faith, I have to say, because there really is no data that's declassified or source beyond a lot of reporting about the Russian-backed TV network, RT, but this hardly seems like strong intelligence for someone who's looking at these conclusions.
PERINO: All right. Kimberly.
GUILFOYLE: Yes. Hi, Catherine.
HERRIDGE: Hi.
GUILFOYLE: So a couple things catch my -- well, a lot of them. But two that I'd just like to mention real quickly here, when three agencies agreeing with the report, CIA and FBI, with high confidence, but it specifies that the NSA attributed with moderate confidence, so that's one.
And then secondly, per James Rosen, when he was reporting earlier that there was a major hole in the ODNI report, that there were Podesta -- nothing was mentioned about Podesta or his e-mail hacking. If you can just address those two things.
HERRIDGE: Sure. So generally speaking with the key judgments, they're at high confidence. There are some other assessments or conclusions that are at moderate confidence. And if you want to be a real intel geek about this, you can look at the table in the back to understand what that means. But like I said, I'd say high confidence is like an ""A,"" ""A+"" for the underlying intelligence, and moderate would be like a ""B,"" ""B-,"" which of course I'm very familiar with from my days in school.
OK. OK, so on this other point, on the Podesta -- James is correct that there is not a reference to the Podesta emails. But I would argue that it's kind of a given in the way the report is written.
It says that WikiLeaks was the recipient of documents that came through the Russian intelligence services. WikiLeaks posted the DNC emails, as well as the Podesta emails. And the intelligence community assessed that the Russians chose WikiLeaks, because it has a track record for being very reliable and authoritative.
And they also said -- and I thought this was pretty important -- that there was no evidence that the emails were doctored in any way. And I think if you remember, in the weeks leading up to the election, the campaign said repeatedly that they had been doctored or altered in some way, but that was not the finding of the IC.
Final thing on this if I can...
GUILFOYLE: Interesting.
HERRIDGE: ... they talk about WikiLeaks getting the information from the Russian intelligence services. But there's no underlying data to help you understand what that -- that's based upon. That would be in the classified version.
And Julian Assange has been very, very direct and on the record with Sean Hannity about the source and that he does not believe it was the Russian government. So you're going to have to -- I really encourage people to read it for themselves and come to their own conclusions about the report.
PERINO: All right. Eric.
BOLLING: So Catherine, when -- remembering back from my high school days, you have a hypothesis, and then you go to the proof. And I'm looking for the proof here. I'm just going to read the lines. ""We assess Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an influence campaign in 2016,"" and it goes through the things that you mentioned. There's your hypothesis. And I'm still, still looking for the proof. I don't see it.
HERRIDGE: I know.
BOLLING: You mentioned it, ""A+"" or ""B-.""
HERRIDGE: Yes.
BOLLING: So far I'm giving them a -- maybe a ""D,"" maybe an ""F."" And let's say, give me some evidence. Am I wrong?
HERRIDGE: Well, the unclassified report is just not going to contain the underlying data about the sources. So for example, whether it came from human spying or whether it came from intercepted phone calls. That's kind of the jeopardy of putting out something that's unclassified.
And as I said earlier, you have to take a lot of it on faith, that the underlying data in the classified report really backs up these very sweeping -- and as I said at the beginning, very strongly-worded conclusions about what happened. But I would really encourage...
BOLLING: Can I...
HERRIDGE: Go ahead.
BOLLING: Can I just add that DNI Clapper is also the guy who testified under oath that Americans were not -- Americans were not being data mined and later had to walk that back after it was being proven that we were, in fact, and he did, in fact, know about it.
HERRIDGE: I know. And, you know, let's -- I sort of hesitate to mention Benghazi. But I mean, we reported a week after the attack it was not a demonstration, and it took about a month for everyone to come clean on that.
So people have to read it for themselves. I would suggest a couple of times, and they can reach their own conclusions about whether it's a politicized document or not.
One of the things that really jumps out at me is there was -- it want -- the document wants people to understand that it, in no way, measured how it influenced voters. And I go back to the quote I gave Dana. The report itself acknowledges that the Russians felt the campaign had failed and that she was going to win, so they decided to use the evidence sort of as leverage against a Clinton presidency, which never happened.
And I would also tell you, from my experience, because this is what the U.S. government does, too. We collect information as a way to hedge our bets. We try and understand as much as possible about what a future government, a future administration is going to look like. So that is not all that unusual. What's unusual here is that it was very targeted to, they say, hurt one candidate and help another in this case.
BOLLING: Thank you.
PERINO: All right. Juan.
WILLIAMS: So by the way, I take a different view, because I think there are now 16 agencies who agree with what you've called an ""A"" OR ""A+"" assessment. So even though we may not be able to identify, because this is spy craft, and not be told the sources or methods, I don't see that that's unusual. That's commonplace in terms of reports on intelligence to the American people. But we have to trust that, in fact, the people who are in our intelligence community are people of some integrity. I happen to trust that. I don't think it can be politicized across so many lines of authority.
HERRIDGE: Right.
WILLIAMS: Which brings me to today's meeting between Donald Trump and Jim Clapper, the director of national intelligence; Jim Comey, the FBI director; Mike Rogers. And I wonder, Catherine, if you know what happened there, because even earlier today, Donald Trump was telling The New York Times that he thinks this is nothing but a witch hunt, a witch hunt done by people who are unhappy with the election results.
HERRIDGE: I don't have good information about what happened inside that briefing, because I've been kind of working two stories this afternoon, the Florida thing and this thing. So I don't want to give you bad information.
But what I would say is that this is really a case that we have never seen before. What I mean by that is the -- an influence campaign targeting an election. But we have never seen an outgoing administration dump a report like this on an incoming administration, and it really has the effect of undermining the results. I don't know how you can really see it in any other way.
And, again, people have got to read it for themselves. They have to look at the conclusions. They have to decide whether they've got faith in the underlying data and whether this is a starting point to have a more active cyber policy that would prevent this in the future or whether it's kind of payback by an administration that didn't act fast enough and allowed this to happen.
PERINO: That's -- that is a very good question.
Also, last question for you, Catherine.
HERRIDGE: Sure.
PERINO: Do you have any information or background on the Jim Woolsey decision, the former CIA director, who was working with the Trump campaign and decided to effectively end that relationship yesterday?
HERRIDGE: I want -- I want to think about what I want to say here.
GUTFELD: Wait. This is cable news.
HERRIDGE: I think what I want to say...
GUTFELD: This is cable news. No thinking, just talking.
PERINO: No thinking allowed.
GUILFOYLE: This is ""The Five."" It's ""The Five."" Don't worry.
HERRIDGE: I guess what I would say is that I think there could have been better communication between the transition team and Mr. Woolsey about what the objectives were and what his role was and how much input he would have.
PERINO: Right. Often has.
HERRIDGE: That's the diplomatic way I would say it. And I will...
PERINO: Such a diplomat.
HERRIDGE: ... think before I speak next time.
PERINO: You're such a diplomat. Catherine, thank you very much.
HERRIDGE: You're welcome.
PERINO: We always appreciate your expertise.
GUILFOYLE: You're ready for ""Special Report.""
PERINO: Wasn't -- she got, like, straight ""A's"" all through...
GUILFOYLE: I mean, right?
PERINO: Through law school, I believe. I can't believe that.
GUTFELD: She got a ""B-"" in lying, because we knew she was lying there.
I think -- I have to say, this is -- this is an incredible victory for Putin. He's -- the whole point was to create a rift and to subvert the trust in our intel, because that's a very -- by having the president-elect marginalize your spy services, it's like your rival team is benching your smartest player or your QB. It's like that's what's happening. It's like even Putin -- Putin didn't have to do that much. He did it.
GUILFOYLE: Well, he was, like, the king of the KGB.
GUTFELD: He was, yes.
PERINO: Never forget.
GUILFOYLE: Sort of put it (ph)...
GUTFELD: That was the GRU.
BOLLING: But -- but there is that school of thought that says that the intel community has been politicized. And you look at the two examples, the one I mentioned with DNI Clapper, who had to walk back the comment in front of Senator Weyden (ph), a Democrat.
GUTFELD: And also the ISIS stuff.
BOLLING: And -- and the red line stuff, where remember, the 50 agents said, ""You know what? We were not allowed -- we were trying to tell the top levels of intel that the red line has been crossed, but it would look bad for President Obama."" And the top levels apparently sat on that information or hid it in some format.
So you really have to make a leap of faith saying, look, they're good; they're good at gathering. They're good -- I get it. But the analysis of it and...
GUILFOYLE: The same thing with the CIA and Brennan.
BOLLING: ... what they're determining with what they're doing, and how they deliver it to the public. You have to have a bit of a leap of faith to believe that it had -- influenced the election.
GUTFELD: You also need a leap of faith to trust Assange. You know? That's the weird thing. You have the right embracing Assange and badmouthing the NSA. Kind of weird for me. The Cold War has now turned into a hot romance.
WILLIAMS: Yes, Obama said -- Obama said...
GUILFOYLE: Kind of weird.
WILLIAMS: ... Ronald Reagan would be flipping over in his grave. I mean, you know, because it's kind of odd. But here's the thing, and I said this earlier.
PERINO: Like to have Democrats defending the intel community?
GUTFELD: Yes. That's the weirdest part.
WILLIAMS: That's not so odd.
GUTFELD: They spent four decades -- like, being fellow travelers.
WILLIAMS: No, no, no. No, in fact -- in fact, I think lots of people have legitimate criticism about the intelligence community in this country having -- we have too much, too many lines that are overlapped, and it's not clear where the authority lays and who has responsibility. And you get into situations where you can have good data, but then you have questionable analysis.
BOLLING: Analysis.
WILLIAMS: In this case, everybody agrees.
PERINO: I think it's pretty hard to get 16 people to have...
GUTFELD: I didn't even know there were 16. By the way, I think this is an opportunity...
GUILFOYLE: They know about you.
GUTFELD: I know. Well, it's not that hard.
But President-elect Trump has an opportunity to become a hawk on cyber terror. Like, you know, he could come out and go, ""OK, this is baby games. All this hacking and phishing is baby games. We need to focus on marriage of terror and technology. What could happen if they go after our terror grid?"" That's what he should focus on.
WILLIAMS: I love it.
GUTFELD: Enough of this stuff. We have to worry about people attacking and dismantling and destroying the country.
PERINO: Can you imagine if you were one of those sources, and your name or the data that's in the classified report. And you're one of those sources. And you know that you're sitting -- maybe you're sitting in Moscow looking over your shoulder tonight, because -- it's very serious.
GUILFOYLE: Or no longer looking over your shoulder.
GUTFELD: But Putin has a garage, though, because he's mad over the Olympics.
PERINO: Because he was embarrassed.
BOLLING: What was in that report that maybe I'm misinterpreting the report, but it seemed like the intel departments were saying that, yes, the Russians were doing this, but they were doing it through a third party. They were paying or setting up a third party to go ahead and hack. Then they were going to take the information, and they turned it over to Assange.
I mean, then the question is, was this third party actually part of the Russian government or not? Or just state-sponsored?
PERINO: Maybe.
WILLIAMS: No. They said, in fact, they identified the hackers.
PERINO: They do. Right.
WILLIAMS: They say they identified the actors and traced it to Putin in terms of the organization.
BOLLING: In what terms?
WILLIAMS: What do you mean?
BOLLING: Like they were part of the KGB? They were part of...
WILLIAMS: That they were operating under orders from Vladimir Putin.
PERINO: Outsourcing.
BOLLING: Outsourcing is different. By the way, we out -- every country outsources intel. Every single country does it.
GUILFOYLE: It's extenuated (ph). It's not a direct link.
WILLIAMS: No, no. Well, we hire some agents.
BOLLING: Yes.
WILLIAMS: Yes, yes, yes, yes. You mean like covert operatives?
BOLLING: Yes.
WILLIAMS: Let me just say, I don't mean to shift the conversation, just briefly. I think there's so much concern on President-elect Trump's part that this delegitimizes his standing as the winner of this election.
So as the lone Democrat sitting here, let me just remind everybody, the Congress today confirmed that Donald Trump won the election.
GUTFELD: Yes. It's over.
WILLIAMS: It's over. It's like, you know what? That's our president.
GUTFELD: Biden said it was over.
WILLIAMS: It's over. But I don't get why you would then attack the intelligence community. Let's move on. Let's stop talking the politics and worry about delegitimizing Donald Trump. We're in a different game now. It's a foreign country. It's attacking us.
GUTFELD: I agree. Look, the Russians do this stuff. We do this stuff. Everybody does this stuff. This is just tiny stuff. We need to start talking about the big stuff, the attacks on our grid, on our power grid, hospitals, and banks.
BOLLING: Our nuclear codes. Can you imagine if they could hack into everything -- I'm sorry, Dana -- if they could hack into everything, but they can get our nuclear codes?
PERINO: The only thing that makes it different is that we are a country, for all the complaints about how we're not as transparent with our government, there is no other country that is exposing this kind of information and allowing the citizens to read a report as many times as they want to come up with their own conclusions. That is one of the things that makes this country so exceptional.
GUTFELD: And it does tick me off. Like, WikiLeaks began -- its purpose was to go after oppressive regimes. How did we become the oppressive regime to him?
PERINO: We are going to head back to Phil Keating, who is in Fort Lauderdale, and he has an update on the other story that we are covering this hour, the -- Phil. We'll go to you, Phil, for an update.
PHIL KEATING, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: OK.
PERINO: Phil?
GUILFOYLE: Phil?
PERINO: Hey, Phil.
GUTFELD: Phil, what's happening?
PERINO: I don't know.
BOLLING: Think it over first, Phil, before...
PERINO: We might not have Phil. But there will be an update, and I'm sure that ""Special Report"" will be covering.
Kimberly, any last thoughts?
GUILFOYLE: Yes, I was trying to say that Putin doesn't get mad, he just gets even. This is a situation where if he feels we attack him, he's going to do something. He's not going to forget about it.
GUTFELD: Very Russian. Trust me.
GUILFOYLE: You know this, because you live it at home every night.
GUTFELD: Oh, I know.
GUILFOYLE: You're holding up well.
BOLLING: In Clapper's defense, when he did do this oleo (ph) on whether or not we are being data mined, it was because he was asked in a public forum, and he probably had information that he felt was going to be dangerous if he answered it. You know, and some would say he should have just denied answering, because he had done that before.
But so in what your point is, that we are so transparent to the point of sometimes it's dangerous.
WILLIAMS: Well, you know what my thought is? I remember that President Obama said that, because we get so politically divided, we are more susceptible to this kind of attack coming.
GUTFELD: We air -- we air our dirty laundry. That's what our country does.
WILLIAMS: That's what Dana was saying.
GUILFOYLE: Yes, but in the interest of transparency.
WILLIAMS: Thank God for America on that point.
GUTFELD: Yes.
PERINO: I do think that that is quite remarkable. I do think -- it is weird to talk about retaliation against the Russians. Like, with the 35 people being expunged, and they had been here since the '70s and all that.
GUTFELD: Yes. We should just keep them. Better to know...
PERINO: Make them stay here?
GUTFELD: Better to know them than get rid of them. Like, then you've got to start over with all the new people. It's better to know your spies.
GUILFOYLE: Then they sent better ones to replace them.
GUTFELD: Yes. By the way, their spies are always attractive.
WILLIAMS: Oh, my gosh.
GUILFOYLE: Honestly? That's the conclusion?
GUTFELD: Russian spies -- yes.
PERINO: Well, that was one of the things. You watch ""The Americans""?
GUTFELD: Yes. That's where we get our intel, from watching -- watching cable television shows about spies.
PERINO: Well, it was actually very good.
GUTFELD: It is very good.
GUILFOYLE: Just in that Vice-president-elect Pence said that President- elect Trump will take aggressive action early in the days of his administration to combat against cyber hacking.
GUTFELD: There you go.
GUILFOYLE: That just in.
GUTFELD: It's very important.
PERINO: I do think it would have been a strange position for Obama to be in in October, when he's getting this information. He's seeing this coming. He thinks the election is probably going to go Hillary's way, doesn't want to overplay his hand. And all that doesn't work out, and so now they're putting this all there.
WILLIAMS: And now the left is mad at him.
PERINO: At him.
GUILFOYLE: But also, the biggest takeaway from this is, you know, we got a report here and a determination, a conclusion. But again, we don't have the classified information. We have a report mostly with conclusions that are very strong, as she said. So, you know, we're not going to be able to get that information. We have to trust their judgement.
BOLLING: Donald Trump was briefed by the heads of intel, and post briefing he did come out and say -- and he made a formal statement -- that he didn't think whatever they had actually influenced the outcome of the election. Now you can say, well, what else is he going to say, but...
WILLIAMS: No, I think...
(CROSSTALK)
BOLLING: ... would be an opportunity to do that.
GUILFOYLE: Well, nobody -- this report doesn't say that. It doesn't say that it influenced it. It was just that the intention was to influence and undermine and attack one candidate.
PERINO: And also to set up Hillary Clinton for failure. That was -- because they had thought she was going to win, so they wanted stuff to hang on her.
GUTFELD: She didn't need any help.
PERINO: All right. Set your DVR so you never miss an episode of ""The Five."" That's it for us. ""Special Report"" is next with all of this breaking news."
0	13	 14 von 72	Fox News Network	January 6, 2017 Friday	 YOUR WORLD WITH NEIL CAVUTO	 4:24 PM EST		"NEIL CAVUTO, HOST: We`re getting a few more details on the shooter.
Court records show that Santiago had some minor brushes with the law -- this is coming from The Miami Herald -- when he lived in Alaska, including a $1,000 fine for driving without insurance and another infraction for driving with broken taillights.
An Anchorage landlord apparently evicted him last year for failure to pay rent. He was carrying some form of military I.D. We don`t know that -- if it was legitimate I.D. or exactly his I.D. He is suspected of being a former U.S. Army soldier, though, from the New York metropolitan area.
All right, we`re going to get a little bit more of that and what he might know, Senator Marco Rubio from Florida. 
Senator, thank you for taking the time.
SEN. MARCO RUBIO (R), FLORIDA: Thank you.
CAVUTO: Have you learned anything, Senator?
RUBIO: Well, as has been happening often in these events, the information flow into the press is about as fast as for government officials, knowing you have multiple agencies now involved.
The FBI at this time has no reason to believe that it`s an act of terrorism. Obviously, they haven`t ruled anything out yet. And they are going to treat it as such until that`s been ruled out.
But, basically, the information which I have asked and has been confirmed is that he was a passenger on an inbound flight. There are conflicting reports. One agency told me it was a domestic, but not continental United States flight. Another agency, a local agency, said it was a flight coming in from Canada.
But irrespective, he was a passenger who flew in, went to the baggage claim, and then at some point loaded a weapon and came out and fired. And I think what they`re trying to figure out now, obviously, is twofold. One is, is there anybody else involved? Is there anything else going on at the airport?
Because there`s always the fear that the one tactic is designed to draw in law enforcement, and then the other, a secondary attacker, could then target law enforcement first-responders. So, they want to rule that out and then, of course, try to figure out what was behind this.
And so that, I think, it`s going to some time until it`s more forthcoming and we understand all the facts about that.
CAVUTO: What little we do know, Senator -- and you know, obviously, this as well -- is that he came out of the restroom once he got his gun again out of the case, and armed it and then started shooting at this baggage terminal.
The baggage terminal, as is the case in most airports, I guess that`s the same here in Fort Lauderdale, is outside the security perimeter.
RUBIO: Right.
CAVUTO: Already, we have heard calls for maybe baggage terminals should be within the security perimeter. Way too soon to jump to those type of conclusions. But what do you make of that?
RUBIO: Well, first of all, if you talk to law enforcement, the agencies I have spoken to, the bottom line is that he didn`t have to get on an airplane and fly to Fort Lauderdale with a handgun in his bag to carry this out.
He could have just driven up in a car, parked, walked in and done the same thing, perhaps with an even deadlier result. So, again, it`s -- the reason why we prevent handguns on aviation is to prevent hijackings or commandeering of the airplanes and the like.
But, at some point, no matter where you set up the perimeter, there`s going to be somewhere that is outside that perimeter. And there will be people there. So, that`s why this is not -- they`re going to spend some time trying to figure this out, because it doesn`t -- you don`t have to -- if you wanted to shoot up the Fort Lauderdale terminal outside the perimeter, you didn`t have to put it in a bag and fly all the way here.
You could have just driven up or what have you. So, it`s -- or he could have done it wherever he came from. So there`s a lot here to figure out yet still. And I think it will take some time. And certainly people should reserve judgment and learn all the facts before we start proposing regulations and legislation.
CAVUTO: Yes, that is true. You bring up a good point, though, what his interests might have been in Florida. Do we know any of that, if he hails from Alaska or he once lived in Alaska? There`s very little we know about him.
But do we know, or do you know, or have you heard of any Florida connections yet?
RUBIO: No, I haven`t up to this point.
And one of the things about it is, his name is not necessarily rare. Esteban is a very common in that -- in Spanish. And so -- and his last name is not unique either. So, I imagine there are multiple people. If you just did a public search, it would take some time to narrow that down.
Obviously, if they have his identification, he is on the passenger manifest, it will be a lot quicker for law enforcement. But at this moment, that work is ongoing.
And I want to be very cautious, because I don`t want to go any further than what they have gone in terms of making any sort of revelations. But I have yet -- I have not heard anything in the media that is inconsistent with what they have told me so far.
CAVUTO: Senator, you have been very patient.
I would be remiss if I didn`t mention this intel report that came out now and is being shared with the media today and with Americans that Vladimir Putin did indeed have a role and aspired to influence the election. Whether that tipped it to Donald Trump, there`s no way of knowing.
But what do you make of that and that Mr. Trump, who had a chance to be briefed on the same matter, confirmed that Russia certainly tried to influence the election, but obviously he didn`t share the belief that he did -- but what do you make of these latest reports that are coming out?
RUBIO: Well, I will say three things.
And I recall, back in October, when I was on the ballot and these revelations came out, I refused to discuss WikiLeaks. And I said it was the work of a foreign government.
I would say three things. Number one is, I do not believe Donald Trump was elected because of this. I don`t believe it tipped it one way or the other. Number two, they didn`t hack the election voting system. Number three, there`s no doubt in my mind and has never has been any doubt in my mind that there was -- the Russian government, under the Putin government, undertook active measures to influence and/or manipulate American public opinion and to sow chaos in our electoral system.
And if you look at where we stand today, you have got some Democrats questioning the legitimacy of the Trump presidency. And you have the president-elect of the United States questioning the intelligence agencies.
That sounds to me pretty chaotic and destabilizing. And that is the role and the goal of these active measures that Russia has undertaken and -- throughout Europe, interfering in the electoral processes there. And I believe that was part of their aim here. And I have never had any doubt about that.
CAVUTO: Do you think that Vladimir Putin wanted Donald Trump to be president more than he did Hillary Clinton?
RUBIO: Well, it`s difficult to ascribe motive, because I don`t know Vladimir Putin.
I would say to you that I`m not sure they were interested in the ultimate outcome. I think that they most certainly -- their number one goal was to create doubts about our electoral system and its credibility.
I think the secondary goal was to create chaos and animosity (INAUDIBLE) because the more of that exists in the United States, the weaker they believe we are made by it.
So, having people out saying that Trump`s stole the election is part of his goal. And having people questioning Hillary Clinton, had she won, would have been part of his goal.
So, again, I think their overriding goal was to sow chaos, instability, and undermine the credibility of our electoral system. How he feels about the actual outcome is something I can`t answer.
CAVUTO: Finally, sir, and I know you have to go, this was the formality today of Donald Trump being certified in Washington as the next president of the United States. But it was a little bit of a dust-up, to put it mildly, where Joe Biden apparently had to make it official and just say it`s over, despite protests from both elected members, Democrats largely, and protesters who snuck into the well of Congress today to stop this from happening.
How do you think this settles the matter now? There are a lot of people who still are going to be kicking and screaming on this thing two weeks ahead of Donald Trump getting sworn in.
RUBIO: Well, again, I remind people about 2000, where that happened as well.
And ultimately I thought you can focus on three or four House members that decided to make a show of it and a couple people who went into the gallery and started screaming.
CAVUTO: Right.
RUBIO: The bottom line is that a Democratic vice president stood there today, ran that process was it was supposed to be run and announced that Donald Trump had sufficient votes in the Electoral College and is now going to be sworn in as the president of the United States, and that not a single member of the United States -- and that includes Bernie Sanders, who ran himself, and Elizabeth Warren and others -- not a single one of them signed on to any petition to disqualify him.
So, the election is over. The time has come to govern and to run this country. And in about two weeks, Donald Trump is going to be sworn in as president of the United States. And I hope we will have a period of time here where everyone can work together to get things right in this country.
And we will have another election in two years for Congress. But until then, I think we should focus on fixing the problems that are confront of our country. And I hope that`s what will happen.
I understand this will be a handful of people that are going to want to be on the news and get their name out there, but I hope the rest of us will focus on doing our job.
CAVUTO: Senator Marco Rubio, thank you very much. We appreciate you taking the time.
RUBIO: You got it. Thank you.
CAVUTO: All right."
0	14	 15 von 72	MSNBC	January 6, 2017 Friday	 THE LAST WORD WITH LAWRENCE O`DONNELL	 10:00 PM EST	"HIGHLIGHT: According to Washington Associated Press, Trump declines to say whether he accepts Russia`s role in election hack. Donald Trump verbally attacks the press and has sued reporters in his private life. Michael Moore talk about what threats reporters may face under Trump and reacts to Fort Lauderdale shooting. Esteban Santiago, 26, arrived at Fort Lauderdale- Hollywood International Airport, retrieved a gun from his checked luggage in the baggage claim area, loaded it and started firing, killing at least five people and wounded eight others, according to law enforcement officials. The public intelligence briefing concludes that Vladimir Putin directed the hacking and propaganda into the American election to undermine the U.S.-led liberal democratic order.

"	"(FLORIDA OFFICIALS PRESS CONFERENCE IN PROGRESS)
MARK GALE, FT. LAUDERDALE AIRPORT DIRECTOR: -- county commissioners, express our condolences and our sympathies and keep our thoughts and prayers with those that lost their lives here today as well as their family and friends. Truly horrific incident.
As the sheriff has said, we had a number of individuals that were not only stuck on airplanes, planes that had landed but as well as some that were on the gates that were not permitted to leave right after this incident occurred.
We had a number of individuals that evacuated out of the terminal on to different areas. We`ve been working mostly today to make sure that everybody was obviously safe and secure. Once we received that word from our law enforcement partners, we`ve been in the process of either transporting those individuals over to Port Everglades. In Terminal 4, we`ve had dozens and dozens of buses transporting what we anticipate or expect to be somewhere in the neighborhood of about 10,000 folks over to Port Everglades.
Broward County staff as well as the Red Cross are over there to assist those passengers in either getting into destinations, assisting with hotel accommodations, providing them food and shelter. 
Through this evening, we`re going to continue to work with our law enforcement partners here as we continue to try to get the airport back into an operational status. Working with all our airlines, the transportation security administration and others to try to get the Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport back in operation tomorrow morning.
The goal will be to have this operational at 0500, 5:00 a.m. tomorrow morning, but we`re going to be encouraging all our travelers to check with their individual airlines. As some may not be operating right away, clearly, this incident has caused a lot of disruption, not only in their individual schedules but other schedules around the country. So we encourage everybody to actually contact their airlines.
We will continue to provide information through social media and through Twitter, @FLLFlyer, through our webpage. And we encourage people to keep checking those sources for any changes. And that`s all I have for the time being.
GEORGE PIRO, FBI SPECIAL AGENT: Good evening. As the sheriff mentioned, the FBI is working very, very closely with the Broward Sheriff`s Office in this investigation. We have begun the difficult task of processing the crime scene which will allow us to identify the deceased in making the proper notifications to the family members.
As you can imagine with this type of investigation and this type of incident, it is a long-term, very difficult, complex investigation that requires us to pursue all leads and avenues. But we are conducting investigation not only here in South Florida, but in several other states as we try to pursue the suspects` activities leading up to today`s horrific incident.
The subject is in federal custody as the sheriff mentioned. A long interview was conducted of the individual by the FBI and the Broward Sheriff`s Office and he will be charged federally and most likely will have his initial appearance in Broward on Monday.
Again, as I mentioned, with these types of incidents, as horrific they are, we are looking at all avenues. We have not ruled out terrorism and we will be pursuing every angle to try to determine the motive behind this attack and any associates, any connections and communication, everything that you can imagine. I assure you, we are pursuing every possible lead. Thank you.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Was this originally a flight from Anchorage and Minneapolis and then to here?
PIRO: Yes. The individual flew from Alaska to Minneapolis to Fort Lauderdale on a Delta Air Lines flight.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Why was he coming here?
PIRO: At this time, it`s still too early in the investigation for us to truly know why he came to Florida. So those are some of the things that we`re looking at, those -- his travel patterns, what brought him here and his connections to South Florida.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We understand that the suspect had contact with the FBI office in Alaska. Were those agents aware that he had weapons, was anything done to keep those away from him?
PIRO: Yes. The individual did walk into our Anchorage office in November. He came in and spoke with FBI agents. At that time, he clearly stated that he did not intend to harm anyone. However, his erratic behavior concerned FBI agents that were interviewing him and they contacted local police and turned him over to the local police. He was taken into custody by the local police and transported to a medical facility for a mental health evaluation.
We looked at his contacts. We looked at -- we did our interagency checks and everything. And at that point, we`ve closed our assessment.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (Inaudible) take away firearms, did you guys know that he had firearms on him?
PIRO: That answer, I -- or that question, I really don`t have the answers for. Again, it`s very early in the investigation. We are working very closely with our Anchorage field office trying to determine his activities there. But I can`t really tell you about his weapons there.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: He voluntarily walked into the FBI office in Anchorage (inaudible)?
PIRO: Yes, he voluntarily walked into our office and he was interviewed by agents out of that office.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: And how long (inaudible) in Anchorage?
PIRO: That information, I don`t have. Again, it`s very early in the investigation and that`s something that we`ll have to try to determine with our Anchorage field office. He was turned over to local custody and it was the local custody that took him to the medical hospital for evaluation.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Once the FBI (inaudible) in Anchorage, are you guys looking into a house he may have looked at in Anchorage right now?
PIRO: We`re actually looking at several investigative leads not only in Alaska, but in other states that we have determined that he`s either traveled to or has connections there.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Was there a (inaudible) one of the (inaudible). Was there a kind of work on (inaudible) that may have set him off?
PIRO: I`m not aware of any type of incident like that, but again, this is very early in the investigation. But at this point, we`re unaware of an incident either on the flight or baggage claim.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Is there any indication that he had become radicalized in anyway? We know he mentioned some kind of hearing voices in his head.
(OFF-MIC)
PIRO: Again, it`s very early in the investigation. As I mentioned, we`re not ruling out anything. We`re looking at every angle including the terrorism angle, but it`s going to take us some time to determine the true nature of the motivation of the individual.
(OFF-MIC)
PIRO: I believe he is 26 years old. He was in the U.S. military. We are currently reviewing his military records. I can tell you that he was in the military. I believe it was in the army, but we haven`t confirmed exactly his service.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: What type of gun and how many shots fired?
PIRO: What I can tell you at this point is that it was a semi-auto handgun, but I am not prepared to release the type of handgun and it`s way too early in the investigation to tell you how many rounds were fired.
(OFF-MIC)
SHERIFF SCOTT ISRAEL, BROWARD COUNTY, FLORIDA: No, he didn`t try and take any hostages. As the subject, Esteban Santiago, was shooting, he was, as I said, seconds after the shootings contacted by a Broward sheriff`s deputy. Instructions were rendered. He was taken into custody without incident and was immediately interviewed by the FBI and the Broward Sheriff`s Office. One more question.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Sheriff, did he make any statements while he was shooting in your (inaudible)?
ISRAEL: Not to my knowledge. If he (inaudible) Colonel Ryde (ph) will be getting in touch and letting me know when the next press release, when the press conference will be when we`re ready to release more information.
Right now, I just ask that the prayers of the nation be with the people and the families that lost loved ones in Broward County. Thank you.

ARI MELBER, MSNBC NEWS ANCHOR: That was Sheriff Scott Israel, Broward County, Mark Gale, the airport director there, as well as FBI Miami Special Agent in Charge, George Piro, their briefing on that attack earlier today.
I`m Ari Melber in for Lawrence O`Donell here on The Last Word. We have a full live hour for you tonight. Starting here, of course, with more on that attack. NBC News Correspondent Kerry Sanders is live still at that airport. What is the scene there now, Kerry?
KERRY SANDERS, NBC NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Well, the airport remains closed, but the airport is now beginning to come to life. Those passengers who have been held in certain areas and certain terminals for hours today as we just heard in the press conference are beginning to leave. But, it`s a very complicated process. They`re separated from their luggage. In many cases, they`ve been told that their luggage will be retrieved at some point by a private company that will then try to reunite the luggage with them in several days.
35 buses are making the loop around here picking up passengers. You heard them say there may be as many as 10,000 passengers who have been caught up in all of this. They`re taking them over to Port Everglades which is where the cruise ship terminal is. And at that location, they`re helping people make their way to get to hotels. Uber and Lyft have initiated free service and sent, we were told, upwards of 600 cars over to that area to help ferry people.
Airbnb has set up a disaster relief where people can set a free stay at an Airbnb. Anybody who`s watching and needs to find that, it`s airbnb.com/disaster, so that they can find lodging for the night that won`t cost them anything. Get in an Uber or a Lyft to get them over there.
There are also hotels as far away as Boca Raton that are offering free lodging, so the community is coming together to help those people. Some of the people who are leaving here have horrific stories to tell, and one of them is Annika Dean. Now, Anika Dean was down in the luggage area and saw the gunman and that`s when she decided to hit the ground and fortunately for her, and this is a remarkable story, as she hit the ground, another gentleman made his way over to her crawling on the ground and wrapped his body around her telling her and whispering that he would protect her. Listen to a little bit of what Anika had to tell me.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
ANIKA DEAN, WITNESSED SHOOTING: I did see the shooter. I saw the gun. He was walking towards us. I immediately just hid next to a SmartCart, little carousel. I was laying there and maybe 30 seconds, an older gentleman shielded me and told me that he would protect me. And I was terrified because, you know, I have two boys and I was thinking these boys are probably and may not have a mother or a severely injured mother. But I just immediately felt tremendous amount of comfort when this man said, ""I will protect you.""
And there was a man nearby us that was shouting obscenities, attracting the shooter and someone told me the shooter was right by us walking around. I was looking at the carpet. I was not looking up. I was just praying to God. Just praying to God and had an angel protect me.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
SANDERS: Well, her prayers were answered to think that the horrific shooting was taking place around her. We now know from Anika who that hero was. She snapped a picture. Take a look at the picture here. He`s sitting with his wife. His name is Tony Bordowitz (ph). And Tony is the man who just, complete stranger, made his way over to Anika to protect her in the chaos.
As you know, at this point, there are five dead. There were six people who were injured. They were actually wounded with gunfire. In all, there were 30 people taken to the hospitals with other various injuries. And this began at around 12:55, 1:00 today.
And within about the last hour plus, as you look over here behind me, there`s a plane. That`s a United plane. That`s one of the planes that was out on the runway and has been locked down out on the runway until about an hour plus ago when they finally got the clearance to come in, so the passengers who were on that plane have been sitting out there by my calculation for more than eight hours. Anxious, of course, but also cooped up inside there.
The authorities didn`t want to let the planes come in that had already landed with passengers because they were unsure whether there were other problems, other violence, other areas of concern. At one point, people in Terminal 1 said that they had heard gunshots and so the authorities started clearing up that area. And then there were also errant reports with the sort of things that happened in a chaos like this where they heard that there was some other suspicious activity inside the parking garage.
And so, Anika told me surviving that first one, that was quite an ordeal. She said it was just the second and third ones when she heard about what was going on in Terminal 1 and it was spilling over to two, and then what was going on the parking garage. She said that all of that combined has just made this, you know, just really difficult for her to endure. But thankfully for her and so many people, they did survive.
They did say that the police did arrive quickly. There`ve been some earlier reports that it took the officers awhile to get there, but according to Anika, it seemed to her that they were there within about 60 seconds or so. But as we know, Esteban Santiago, who we heard in the news conference, the 26-year-old alleged gunman, had arrived from Anchorage to Minneapolis and Minneapolis to Fort Lauderdale.
Apparently, retreat his luggage down at baggage claim. He had checked a pistol inside his luggage. Witnesses say he took his luggage into the bathroom, retrieved the pistol and came out. It was loaded at that point. We don`t believe it was loaded while it was in the luggage and then began firing. And the witnesses say that he seemed to have enough time to shoot, change the clip, shoot again, change the clip again.
So, I think there`s going to be a lot of questions at the end of this of checking even a gun that has no bullets in it. Checking that through where it can be retrieved on the other end of an airport.
But this happens everyday. People do check their rifles, check their pistols.
MELBER: Right.
SANDERS: And there is a procedure for it. I think the real question here, quite frankly, Ari, is if the FBI knew about this guy in Anchorage and if he was demonstrating mental capacity issues and appeared to be a threat, how his name didn`t wind up on that No Fly List. It`s just, you know, that`s the crisscross here that I think people are going to wonder at the end of this.
MELBER: Yeah, you raised an investigative question which we`re going to follow, but also every time we see some of these horrific attacks, we also see stories of incredible bravery of compassion, of perseverance. And thank you for detailing one of those tonight, Kerry Sanders.
SANDERS: Sure.
MELBER: Here is a little bit more of what we do know about the suspect. Esteban Santiago, born in New Jersey. Grew up in Puerto Rico where he served in the National Guard and spent a year in Iraq. Santiago moved to Alaska two years ago. As Kerry was mentioning, served in the National Guard there. Discharged last August for unsatisfactory performance. His family saying he received psychological counseling in Puerto Rico after returning from Iraq as well as in Alaska.
Jim Cavanaugh, an MSNBC law enforcement analyst, joins me now for more. Jim, on the psychological profiling here, everyone likes to do Monday morning quarterbacking. In fact, his (ph), as you know, as I know, the FBI cannot just hold anyone who looks suspicious no matter how much contact they have with him absent a crime or an intention to do a crime that`s clearly stated as a threat.
So walk us through what they learned here from, as we just saw in the briefing, what was an interaction with the suspect and what else you`re thinking about looking at all of this.
JIM CAVANAUGH, MSNBC LAW ENFORCEMENT ANALYST: Well, the FBI didn`t do anything wrong in Alaska, and I`ve had this exact scenario, you know, the guys coming into my office talking about, you know, the CIA is talking to them through their head and they`re telling them to do bad things, this is not an unusual event.
The FBI in Alaska didn`t do anything wrong. They called the local police and the local police did what they`re supposed to do. They took him for a mental health evaluation.
The gap in all of this -- and I spent my whole life doing this with these guys, the gap in all of this is we don`t have the right statute. Now, some states have put them in place, a gun violence restraining order. It`s a very tempory thing, it can be written appropriately so your rights are endangered. But it can help law enforcement, help a guy like this guy and all the people who were murdered today. I call it the tragedy triangle. Now, this is my own personal assessment over there after all those years.
But it`s -- there`s some mental health issues, then there`s some contact with the police and then a gun enters the picture. So that triangle, some mental health issues, some contact with the police and then a gun enters the picture, there`s tragedy in the middle. So how do you interrupt that?
For example, if that was a state with a state law like a gun violence restraining order when he went into the FBI, the police could have been called and said, ""Hey, this guy is talking like this, we might need to see if he has guns at home. He`s a danger to himself or others."" We might need to secure those until we can sort this out and flag the National Insta Check System so he can`t buy a gun. You know, until this is all sorted out by the court. So, we`re not taking away his rights, we`re just -- a temporary restraining order. It`s kind of like a domestic violence restraining order.
MELBER: Right. Well, part of what you`re saying here is that --
CAVANAUGH: So --
MELBER: Part of what you`re saying is that, in a lot of the states, the policy, the toolkit available to law enforcement is not strong enough even when you have someone who is not only displaying mental -- potentially mental instability but also is actually interacting with law enforcement so they have a first-person primary witness ability to make that assessment and they`re still being hobbled. You know, I`m going to speak later in the broadcast to Michael Moore who made a whole documentary about gun violence.
I think it`s fair to say you and Michael Moore don`t agree on everything. I know both of you. But it seems to me that as a law enforcement person, there is some overlap in that you`re saying you do agree there`s got to be more tools there for law enforcement to at least, as you`re saying, on a court ordered basis intercept what would otherwise be a mentally unstable person potentially getting a gun at the worst possible time.
CAVANAUGH: Right. And so when did this guy get the gun that he now murdered five people with and shot all these other folks in Fort Lauderdale, when did he get this gun? Did he get it after he went to the FBI? Because they couldn`t legally stop him from getting the gun. He has not been committed to a mental institution. That`s the federal law since 1968, if you`re committed by the court. He wasn`t committed from what we know. He was voluntarily entered so they couldn`t prevent it. That`s why those gun violence restraining orders are important. You can`t stop everybody, but this guy could have been stopped. He was known to law enforcement, so.
MELBER: All right, former ATF Special Agent Jim Cavanaugh, thank you as always. Appreciate it.
Coming up, Michael Moore, as I mentioned, here with us to react to some of the events in Florida as well as to Donald Trump`s intelligence briefing today.
MELBER: Welcome back to The Last Word. Our other top story tonight, the Russia hacks. We live in a world full of hyperbole. If you follow the news, you`re bound to hear many unprecedented developments hyped up. But today was truly momentous and at times bizarre by any standard, including every other presidential transition in American history.
Today, leaders of our nation`s intelligence agencies briefed an incoming president about one, why a foreign adversary favored him over the candidate he beat. Two, why the U.S. intelligence they offered is solid and thus this president-elect, in their view, is wrong. And three, why they`re taking this unusual step of releasing part of that briefing to the public.
So tonight, we actually know a lot more than we knew this morning about all of these unusual developments including Donald Trump`s response. The public intelligence briefing concludes that Vladimir Putin directed the hacking and propaganda into the American election in order to undermine public faith in the U.S. democratic process, denigrate Secretary Clinton and harm her electability and potential presidency.
The briefing notes that while the hacking began, long before Trump was the nominee back when few people in the U.S. or abroad thought he would win. Remember that. But overtime, they say it appeared that he might win. And then, Putin and the Russian government developed a clear preference for Trump. Why, well, the briefing includes some fairly typical reasons that are interesting but not remarkable like the view that Trump`s foreign policy would just favor Russia`s interest in the Middle East.
And then has some responses, some reasoning that is profoundly disturbing if true. Like Putin`s track record of getting his way with ""Western political leaders whose business interest made them more disposed to deal with Russia such as former Italian prime minister, Silvio Berlusconi"".
Yes, you heard that right. This new intelligence report says Putin prefers Trump because he thinks Trump and his businesses, basically his profits and his debts, will give Putin leverage. Leverage over Trump, thus, leverage over us.
Now, let`s be clear, that`s not a finding that Trump`s debts will actually result in giving Putin that power. It`s a finding that that`s what Putin thinks. And maybe Putin thinks that based on business deals he knows about or based on other hacks he`s done since the briefing also finds Russia led hacks into both the DNC and the RNC but only released DNC material.
Now, Trump could counter some of these suspicions by releasing his tax returns and divesting from his international businesses which were told Putin believes gives him leverage. Until Donald Trump does that, these questions, to be clear, will only intensify as they should.
Today, though, Trump`s response fell far short of even accepting the findings on Russia saying, ""While Russia, China, other countries, outside groups and people are consistently trying to break through the cyber infrastructure of our government institutions, businesses and organizations including the DNC, there was absolutely no effect on the outcome of the election including the fact that there was no tampering whatsoever with voting machines.""
While Trump stressed the hack had no effect on the election outcome, that`s his opinion, the briefing, to be clear, didn`t reach any conclusion on that score.
Joining me now is Malcolm Nance, MSNBC counterterrorism and intelligence analyst, Rick Wilson, Republican strategist and Ken Dilanian, NBC news intelligence and national security reporter.
Ken, when you look at what`s in the briefing, what is the key takeaways and what did you make of that reference worded very carefully but a reference to Putin`s belief that the Trump organization will help Putin have power potentially over Trump.
KEN DILANIAN, NBC NEWS, NATIONAL SECURITY REPORTER: I`m not sure what to make of that, to be honest, sorry. I mean, although, you know, it does track with Putin`s previous history of favoring right wing and wealthy political leaders. But in terms of the key takeaways, I was struck, you know, in the lead up to this and the reporting on this, there was a dispute over what the motives were, right? There were some people who said the motives were to elect Trump and there were some other sources were saying, ""No, it was really to destabilize American democracy.""
What we see now is that it was both and that it evolves. And -- but there was a key finding that by the end, the Russians were trying to get Trump elected and they were happy when he was. And, that`s something that`s going to be interesting to see how Trump reacts to as this thing moves on.
MELBER: All right, Rick, when you look at Donald Trump`s response on a scale of one, complete, and total rejection and 10, a responsible normal president working with the intelligence agencies, where did you see him landing today?
RICK WILSON, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST: Well, I guess the response has probably made more sense in the original Russian. This is a guy who is consistently siding (ph) with -- I mean, the things out of WikiLeaks today, the things that have -- and out of Trump`s mouth were identical. This is a guy who clearly does not believe the American intelligence community. He instead believes Julian Assange and Vladimir Putin. And it`s really troubling. And I think even this very carefully worded report which, you know, obviously protects sources and methods and obviously does its best to not, you know, outline exactly what Sigan (ph) or comment channels or other intelligence channels this information came to us by.
You know, it still presents an awful lot of evidence that Trump outright rejected and I find that -- I find it remarkable. It`s an ongoing war with the intelligence community that he is waging that I think is going to have some downstream consequences for him.
MELBER: Well, you mentioned his rejection and where that comes from. Malcolm, former acting CIA director, Michael Moore, was talking about this and he says, Trump`s repudiation of the CIA flows from his desire to protect his brand in all cost, his need to always be right, his refusal to change his views based on new information and his unwillingness to listen to others. It flows from who he is as a person. He goes on to argue that if that doesn`t change, it will be dangerous.
MALCOLM NANCE, MSNBC COUNTERTERRORISM AND INTEGGENCE ANALYST: Well, he`s absolutely right and some of the comments that we have seen just today are going to prove dangerous, because the report that we are looking at tonight, the report that you are looking at tonight, by the way, which was almost identical to the book that I wrote three months ago on this exact subject, it was unclassified. It was a wash of any sources and methodologies.
Donald Trump`s brief is going to show the actual path ways of how that information came to be. He was shown that and now he believes, flat out, the only thing that he believes related to that report is that he thinks that this did not benefit him and that didn`t win him the election. And that`s all he`s concerned about.
Whether it damages the intelligence community, whether he comes out and may compromise the sources, we don`t know. But you know, what Donald Trump does from this point, he`s going to own this system and it`s a question of whether he`s going to listen to it or is he going to abuse it.
MELBER: And, Ken, he told the A.P. here afterward, you know, I learned a lot and I think they did also. He wasn`t briefing the intelligence agencies on anything that he had independently researched. I mean that is bizarre.
KEN DILANIAN, MSNBC NEWS INTELLIGENCE REPORTER: I`m not sure what to make of that but I did -- It was a more conciliatory Donald Trump in the statement that we saw after the briefing. He didn`t -- And the intelligence community officials I talked to took note of that. He didn`t -- They were afraid he was going to start tweeting and denouncing the intelligence community as he has been in recent weeks. He didn`t do that. He didn`t do stuff to find it (ph).
MELBER: What does that say? I mean what does that say that you`ve got sources that, you`re just reporting on what you`re finding? But what does that say that you`ve got sources who are now saying, oh, well, even though he didn`t accept our findings, which is our work, which is our role, which is the national security piece of this, at least he didn`t disparage us publicly on the internet. Is that where we are?
DILANANIAN: It is a remarkable state of affairs, isn`t it? But, you know -- And just because he didn`t accept the findings publicly doesn`t mean he`s not accepting them behind the scenes and he`s not trying to find a way to thread the needle. I mean obviously he saw this whole thing as an effort to undermine his victory and that`s the most important thing to him, it`s to be able to say this didn`t affect the vote --
(CROSSTALK)
MELBER: Rick, go ahead.
RICK WILSON, CONTRIBUTOR, ""THE DAILY BEAST"": You know, I think Malcolm is right on target. I mean this is a guy who is obsessed about having lustrousness to his name. And that if the thought that the Russians put their thumb on the scale in some way and it becomes associated with his brand that it`s bad for his brand, I mean this is -- It`s remarkable that he is much more defensive about whether or not he looks bad than what the Russians have done in the course of running what is clearly from the leaks of the classified portions and the non-classified report issued today a very broad spectrum program of active measures directed against this country. I mean he was more concerned about the leak to NBC than he is about Vladimir Putin intervening in our democracy.
MELBER: Right. You mentioned that leak and his calling for some kind of investigation, which we`re going to discuss more later this hour. To your point, Rick, this is why we generally have presidents with some prior record of service, be it military, government or public, because they have some experience working on something other than themselves.
And in his case, it`s private interests and a business. There is no other record. Malcolm, take a listen to Leon Panetta, also a former CIA director, talking about just you how unusual and problematic this all is.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
LEON EDWARD PANETTA, FORMER CIA DIRECTOR: I have never seen anything like this in my lifetime. The fact that the president elect is tweeting on this issue and taking it to the public and in many ways undermining the credibility of the very intelligence agencies that have to provide information to him in order for him to be President of the United States, this is just unheard of and unprecedented.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
MELBER: And so, Malcolm, I guess the real question is what is in the face of what may be unprecedented and inappropriate conduct, what is the appropriate way for responsible people including in government to deal with all of this?
NANCE: Well, if there were an adult in the room, actually who`s going to take over the reigns of power, they would moderate their comments, understand there`s a system in place that is not here just for the generation of information because he`s going to become the consumer of that information, because he`s going to become the consumer of that information.
They are here to protect this nation and let me tell you, within the intelligence community, I`m an intelligence practitioner and the people who I communicate with are intelligence practitioners.
This has gone way beyond serious. And like Leon Panetta, I think that this has gone from serious to suspicious. Anybody else in a position who would have a top secret code security clearance would have their lives ripped apart right now before being suspected of being an agent of a foreign power.
I can`t say that that`s what`s happening here, but Donald Trump benefitted from this hack. Donald Trump doesn`t acknowledge that but what he does acknowledge is that he is grateful by the way that he speaks about these foreign powers for whatever they did but he won`t recognize his own nation`s defense for this cyber warfare operation that was carried out against democracy.
MELBER: Well, I think you`re putting your finger right (ph). I mean, Rick, isn`t that the most disturbing part about where we land, which is if you imagine a person who might have benefitted inadvertently or accidentally from this kind of foreign intrusion, you would expect them to, if anything go to the other extreme and say I`m going to work with all the independent nonpartisan folks to get to the bottom of this because it`s bigger than the fact that someone may have benefitted me, oh, and by the way, what we often see in foreign policy, they might go even further and say, ""By the way, you`re not getting any favors back from me. I represent the U.S., not Kremlin""? Rick.
WILSON: Just the argument about Hillary is not sufficient to accept the aid, either tacitly or overtly, either consciously or unconsciously of a hostile foreign power, it`s just absolutely wrong.
MELBER: Rick Wilson, Malcolm Nance and Ken Dilanian, thanks for sticking with us and thanks for joining tonight.
Coming up, Michael Moore is here to talk about Donald Trump as well as the shooting today in Florida.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT-ELECT, UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: These are bad people. These are lying people. These are people that rigged the system. The media, they rigged the system.
Sit down. Go ahead.
JORGE RAMOS, UNIVISION ANCHOR: I have the right to --.
TRUMP: No, you don`t. You haven`t been called.
RAMOS: I have the right to ask a question.
TRUMP: Go back to Univision.
Even this really dishonest media people, the world`s most dishonest people.
There`s something happening, they`re not reporting it. Katy, you`re not it, Katy.
By the way, I hate some of these people but I`d never tell them. I would never do that. That`s secret. No, I wouldn`t.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
MELBER: Donald Trump`s verbal attacks on the press are well-known and he has sued reporters in his private life. But as incoming president, he just drew a new line.
After NBC`s reporting about the intelligence on Russia, Trump wrote, ""I`m asking the chairs of the house and Senate committees to investigate top secret intelligence shared with NBC prior to me seeing it.""
NBC news checked and neither committee has received that request. But this is not just Twitter trash talk. This is the head of the government in a few weeks calling for investigations into intelligence officials that he`s currently debating and the press that dares report on the materials.
And while legally that kind of investigation is usually done by the executive branch, the FBI, not the congressional committee, that may just be a small detail in the steep learning curve of the Donald Trump presidency, because the larger question here isn`t whether Trump knows how to order this kind of inquiry into the free press, but why he wants to.
Joining us now, Michael Moore, Academy Award Winning Documentary Filmmaker. His latest film is ""Michael Moore in TrumpLand"". Thanks for being with us tonight. Your thoughts on what he`s up to here and whether it`s concerning.
MICHAEL MOORE, FILMMAKER: Well, the reason it works, when he does that anger, get people to hate the press that`s standing there, is because the press has not done the job that the people expected to do.
Let`s just -- We don`t have to go back all through my life. Let`s just go back to the beginning of the Iraq War when the ""New York Times"" had a reporter who was writing stories that simply weren`t true about Saddam and weapons of mass destruction. And from that point on, then go through the banking crisis, you know, where the media, many of the people in the media, just don`t understand basic economics or how the economic system runs or what -- you know, I would go on the shows back then and I would say, ""All right. Explain to me a credit default swap if you could in 30 seconds.""
MELBER: Can I have two minutes.
MOORE: No, I`m not going to do this to you right now. You know, you might actually know -- You have that scary credit default swap look right now. So I won`t go do it.
But I`m just saying that people`s lives in this country have been affected deeply and in many cases ruined and many of our young people dead in Iraq and Afghanistan as a result of the press not doing their job and asking the questions and demanding the answers.
And so there`s already a distrust and he knows how to milk that quite well. The fact that he goes after NBC, I mean I`ve started watching this at the beginning, from the -- where he`s -- when he came down the escalator, he gave his conference to announce that he`s running for president. Two days later, this network fires him from the apprentice. I mean basically ends the relationship with him.
So you know this about him. His skin is so thin. I mean if Alec Baldwin, also on this network, does an impersonation of him, you know, he goes crazy.
MELBER: Ballistic, yeah.
MOORE: But he actually got fired. ""You`re fired,"" is what NBC said to him two days after his announcement in June of 2015. And right away Katy Tur is on the beat, you know, and initially he starts his thing, where he -- well, you know, his love (ph), it`s a woman covering him, you know, he`s -- and he tries to put on that Trump -- I hate to call it charm, but he thinks it`s charm, and she didn`t fall for it. She was actually a journalist and asked questions and demanded answers and gave honest reports. And if you watch Katy Tur right back then, you have no idea what her personal politics are or how she votes or whatever. That just drove him crazy. And I think any time a woman, whether it`s Megyn Kelly or Katy Tur or, you know, whoever, isn`t enamored with him, he loses it, so.
MELBER: Do you think the diagnosis you just gave then means, that when he calls for this investigation, it is him talking trash or when he`s --
MOORE: No.
MELBER: -- at the government, it`s a real threat, it`s a free speak.
MOORE: No, it`s an absolute real threat. Absolutely. No, no, he will come after you. You, personally, you the network and if you cross him, he will use his power to do this as he has used his power in private business.
You know, all the media should be very concerned about this and I forgot who wrote this piece awhile back about how sadly President Obama paved the way by, you know -- I think there`s eight whistleblowers.
MELBER: The Obama administration has done more prosecutions under the espionage acts targeting whistleblowers and at times reporters and what used to be --
MOORE: James Risen.
MELBER: -- more of a privilege.
MOORE: Correct.
MELBER: Right.
MOORE: Right. And then all the presidents combined, I think, before Obama for 200 years, they jailed three whistleblowers and he has jailed eight and gone after everybody James Risen`s and everybody else.
So, that sort of opened the door sadly.
MELBER: Right.
MOORE: And Trump will take advantage of that door and I think anybody who cares that cares about the truth needs to be worried about this, because this man, not only has revenge on the mind constantly, behaves like, I used to say, a 12-year-old, but I feel rather that`s unfair to 12-year-olds. And also, the way that he seek (ph) this, I mean, today, he goes after his own show. He is the executive producer of the apprentice.
MELBER: Right. Yes, and cutting his own profits.
(CROSSTALK)
MOORE: Going against his own, yes, financial interest. He goes against the new show.
MELBER: If we fit in a break, will you stay with us?
MOORE: Absolutely.
MELBER: And I should say, these are issues that concern people as a citizens, as reporters. As a lawyer, I previously was on the legal team for James Risen. So I always disclose that when his name comes out. But, OK, so obviously, there are a lot of people who follow.
Michael Moore will stay with us. We`ll take a quick break and talk about the other big story right after this.
MELBER: We`re learning more about the gunman who killed five people and injured another eight at the Fort Lauderdale Airport today.
Now, earlier tonight in NBC news spoke with the gunman`s aunt that says he changed after his service in Iraq.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
MARIA RUIZ, AUNT OF ESTEBAN SANTIAGO (translated): Esteban is a good kid but he went to Iraq. The National Guard sent him over there. He was there for a few months. He wasn`t OK when he left there.
After six months in Iraq, his father died and it appears that affected him even more.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
MELBER: Back with me is Michael Moore, whose Oscar Winning Documentary ""Bowling for Columbine"" examined gun violence in America.
You have refused yourself at times from always commenting on what has become an increasing tort of mass shootings.
MOORE: Yes, after Sandy Hook, I`ve told MSNBC and CNN, because they were constantly calling me after these shootings because I made ""Bowling for Columbine"", and I said, ""I`m sorry. I`m not going to be a pundit for this with a new normal."" And I`m not going to be part of the new normal where ultimately the schools says (ph), ""Let`s have on the director of ""Bowling for Columbine."" I reject that. I reject our culture like that. We have 90 percent of the country that wanted that Obama gun law passed and we couldn`t get it passed. I mean, you know, so --.
MELBER: You know, you say the new normal. When I started covering these shootings, they were the thing in the news that would make me cry more than anything else and we do with a lot of different stories, and I remember crying before going on set and trying to get it together and then I can remember doing this long enough and I haven`t been doing it that long where you cry less and they happen so often. What it -- What do -- Here, you deal in art and story telling, what do you do with a country that`s desensitized?
MOORE: I was talking to your executive producer this afternoon and I said, ""I don`t know if I want to come on,"" because I`m done. I`m checked out of this. I`m not a participant in the new normal. And he pointed out he said, ""Yeah, but like in the old days, like you just said, this would have been wall to wall on MSNBC Tonight. And now because it`s just this month`s mass shooting, you know, we`re also going to talk about the other things we should be talking about, the Russian thing and everything else today."" So I said I would come on and I guess the thing I want to say about this particular shooting, we don`t know a lot as we sit here right now, but the things we do know are this. As his aunt said he was a good kid and then he went to Iraq. He joined the National Guard.
You know, back in my day and actually even before the Iraq and Afghanistan Wars, guys I know in Michigan who joined the National Guard, you do that as an extra thing to make a little money. You have a regular job. You do that. You do it on the weekend and you do it in case Michigan needs. I mean there`s now the internal national problem. That`s why it`s called the National Guard.
You don`t join the National Guard to go fight a foreign war. But these National Guard men and women have been sent over there, one tour, two tours, three tours, four. And the fact that he couldn`t get the mental help that he needed, this is what we should be talking about. This is the real -- The real story is that, you know, at first it was an as ISIS thing. ISIS has killed I don`t know, 14, 15, Americans, you know, the actual ISIS, not people who said they were inspired.
MELBER: Lots of sympathizers, yeah.
MOORE: Actual ISIS has killed 14 to 15 Americans. We`ve had a half million to a million troops go to that war over a 15 year period who have come back and many of them need help. They have PTSD. There`re problems in their domestic relationship. There`s all these -- There is this, we are going to suffer more from what Bush and Chaney did to this country, starting a war that was not about the defense of this country.
And the violence of today is the violence that was created to this young man by that former administration. And that is not being discussed. It won`t be discussed all weekend on any of the news shows. But I wanted to bring it up and remind people that as his aunt said he probably was a good kid and then he`s messed up. And if it turns out it was a fight that he got -- you know, there was an argument on the plane and he went and got his gun because it was handy, because we allowed guns to be transported still on planes, you know, if he had the time to cool down and not have access to that gun, maybe we`d be okay.
MELBER: Right.
MOORE: But the fact that he, you know, I mean, I live in Michigan. In my town I have restored these two old theaters and I run them as non-profits for the town. But I have a sign in the window that says, ""We hire Iraq and Afghanistan veterans."" And I`ve asked everybody in Michigan to put that sign on the window and it`s hard to get people to do that.
We have to hire these vets. We have to give them the help they need and I hope this weekend somebody will talk about why this really happened and why this young man ended up in this situation.
MELBER: Michael Moore on the airport shooting. What I want to do is fit in one more break.
And, up next, another important topic, the inaugural protest by the women in Washington. Stay with us.
MELBER: You`re watching the ""The Last World"". Back with us is Michael Moore. The other question I want to ask you looking forward. What are you inauguration plans?
MOORE: Well, I`m going to be in D.C. as I think hundreds of thousands of people are going to be there on the big Women`s March on Washington. Women`s March on Washington, that`s the one -- If you want to go online at womensmarch.com or in Twitter it`s @womensmarch.
This is the thing everyone is coming to, women, men, everybody. And that it`s going to be not the day of the inauguration. It`s the day after. It`s the sort of the first full day of the Trump era. I can`t believe I said those words, the potentially short-lived Trump era. That will be Saturday, January 21st, Women`s March on Washington.
MELBER: For those of us who`ve grown up on your work, who many people take inspiration from the way you tell stories and the way you do your work, what do you say to people who look at this right now and there are many and I hear from them who`ll say it seems hopeless depending on their views. What`s the point? What`s the point of a march? What`s the point of doing anything right now?
MOORE: Oh, well, first of all, Trump gets upset if there`s 10 people outside Trump Tower. He tweets about it. ""Unfair,"" the first, then after he wins, right, he has won, he goes, ""Protesters down on the streets. It`s like 10 people. Unfair."" It`s like --.
MELBER: It`s true.
MOORE: It`s right, yeah. No, he did. That`s the word he used and it`s like, wow, what is he going to think if there`s 100,000 or 500,000? I mean, you know, it`s so important that we all, everybody who can go there, go there.
It`s a weekend. Come on, you know, it`s down south. It`s at D.C., you know, there won`t be a lot of snow. But no, it`s -- this will have an effect. We have to throw everything at this. This man is slightly unhinged, if I can say that, and he`s a malignant narcissist. So he cares very much about what people think of him. He wants to be the popular guy and he`s going to be very upset if there`s a lot of people there and then beyond that, beyond the 21st, the people that Rachel had on the other night, all the other groups, Boe Wilmans (ph), got a thing going -- you could go online. There`s so many groups forming. You can go to my website or my Facebook. There`s so many things we`re going to be putting out there. We`re going to be busy, busy, busy, 100 days of resistance, the first 100 days.
Look, we stopped him this week when congress tried to get rid of the office of ethics.
MELBER: The ethics, got it, yeah.
MOORE: Yeah. He didn`t stop it. He had Kellyanne on the ""Today"" show.
MELBER: Defending it.
MOORE: Defending it at 8:00 a.m. But we all went on Facebook and said everybody call at 9:00 the switchboard opens and they were swamped. It broke the switchboard and by -- after 10:00, Trump gave in, gave in after an hour.
MELBER: So you say the key part of it is keeping track of what`s happening so you can show them you know what`s happening, the consequences?
MOORE: And you show up. And everybody, you have to show up. You have to get up off the couch. You have to go and do something. Everybody, look, I`m so encouraged by this march. I was in just come before coming out there back in your -- the people that do the make up and the hair back there.
MELBER: Yeah.
MOORE: Such a wonderful job. Every time, I say to them, ""You can`t do anything.""
MELBER: Well, you have a nice Bowling there, yeah.
MOORE: But they`re talking about it.
MELBER: Right.
MOORE: When is the last time you saw hair and make up people talking about going to a march in D.C.? I`m telling you, no offense, I`m just saying that`s the new political, that`s the new Americana, and that`s what is going to happen and people are going to be relentless about this. So I am optimistic.
MELBER: Michael Moore, thank you for being here.
MOORE: Thank you.
(CROSSTALK)
MELBER: I really enjoy it and I appreciate your time on Friday night. I`m Ari Melber in for Lawrence O`Donnell.
MOORE: Come back, Lawrence.
MELBER: Lawrence is coming back next week.
(CROSSTALK)
MELBER: Goodnight everybody."
0	15	 16 von 72	MSNBC	January 6, 2017 Friday	 THE RACHEL MADDOW SHOW	 9:00 PM EST	"HIGHLIGHT: The U.S. intelligence report on Russia finds that Vladimir Putin sought to undermine Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election because he blames her for fomenting unrest in Russia after he rigged his own election. Because Americans can read the declassified version of the intelligence report on Russia, Americans can see that Donald Trump is lying about what the report says about the effect on the election and the hacking of Republican targets. Congressman Adam Schiff, ranking member of the Intelligence Committee, talked with Rachel Maddow about the U.S. intelligence report on Russia and Donald Trump`s odd tweet about asking ""committees"" to investigate intelligence leaks to NBC News. Coverage on the news conference on Florida airport shooting.

"	"JOY REID, MSNBC ""A.M. JOY"" HOST: THE RACHEL MADDOW SHOW starts right now. Good evening and happy Friday, Rachel.
RACHEL MADDOW, MSNBC HOST: Happy Friday. I feel like it`s not nice for me to wish you happy Friday because you have to work the next two days too.
REID: Still working.
MADDOW: I know, never not working. Thank you, Joy. I hope you get at least a little respite. 
And thanks to you at home for joining us this hour. It`s good to have you with us. Electoral maps drive Democrats nuts. And this is why.
This is the national electoral map. This was in 2008 when Barack Obama won the presidential election that year by a mile. But the map`s really red, right? Obama won by a lot, he`s in blue, but the map still looks very red.
That`s even more true when you make the map county by county instead of state by state. This is an election that the Democrats won. This kind of things drives Democrats nuts.
But it`s just -- it`s an accident of the way we make maps and the way we show electoral votes, right? People who live in rural areas tend to vote Republican. That shows up on the map as big swathes of the country looking red on the map even if those swathes of the country don`t have very many people in them.
And it happens every election, it happens in a national election like that. Look, this is California from this year. California this year, Hillary Clinton absolutely destroyed Donald Trump. She beat Trump in California by a 30-point margin. But look at the map. Still looks wicked red.
Even in a little state like New Jersey, she won New Jersey by a mile. She won New Jersey by 14 points. But still even in a little state, the rural areas are big. The state still looks very red.
That`s just what maps will look like as long as Democrats tend to live closer together than Republicans do. Even when Republicans lose, the map still makes it look like they won.
Even with that dynamic in mind, though, I want you to check this out. This was a map like that, an electoral result map. This was the election result in Russia in 2011.
Russia is the biggest country in the world in terms of landmass. This is the map of the election results for Russia`s parliamentary elections that took place five years ago. Talk about an overwhelming result, right? I mean, the party that is represented by the dark blue, which is basically the entire map, makes it look like an ocean instead of land, that is the United Russia Party. That`s the party of this guy.
The first-ever president of Russia after the wall fell down and the Soviet Union collapsed and it became Russia instead of the Soviet Union, the first president of Russia was Boris Yeltsin. Boris Yeltsin served from 1991 to 1999 then famously on Y2K, on New Year`s Eve, 1999, December 31st, 1999, the last night of the year, last night of the century, last night of the millennium -- surprise, Boris Yeltsin quit. Dramatic surprise resignation that night as Russia`s first-ever president.
But he was the first one and he quit and that`s when this guy took over and this guy has been in power ever since. From 2000 to 2008, he served as president, Russia`s second president. Legally in 2008, he had to step down from being president, didn`t want to leave power, though, he became prime minister and kept acting like he was president. In 2008, somebody else nominally got to take over the president`s job, even though Putin kept his hands on power.
But you know what? Starting in 2008 when he no longer had the title, those four years obviously still running the country but not having people call him ""president,"" that bothered him. He didn`t like necessarily not being president of Russia, even though he was still running the country. It was bugging him. Those four years not being president, that was enough.
By 2011, he was already making plans that he would like his old job title back, please? He would like to be called president again. So, he`s making plans to do that.
December, 2011, he`s preparing to run again for president, to retake the title of president and while he was preparing to run for president again, something bad happened to Vladimir Putin, because this was the parliamentary election result from December, 2011. And even though this map makes it look like Vladimir Putin`s party, United Russia Party, makes it look like he absolutely ran the table in that election, as we know from our own country, electoral maps can be deceiving.
And even though this looks like it was a route for them, this was actually a bad result for them. Such was the grip of Putin`s party in power that this represented actually a loss of dozens of seats in the parliament. And that was very embarrassing to Vladimir Putin because that election was supposed to be the run-up to him running for president again. That election should have been a moment of triumph for him.
That election was just a few months before he was going to take this historic step of regaining the presidency. It was embarrassing to him that his party lost all those seats. His party got rejected. The number of seats they held in parliament dropped by dozens because of this election result in December, 2011. That was not what he wanted at all as he was ready -- getting ready to go be president again.
And it`s not like, you know, they hadn`t taken it seriously or hadn`t been trying, Vladimir Putin and his party did their absolute best to win as many seats as possible in that election in December, 2011. They did their best. It also appears that they did their worst.
There`s an international organization called the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, one of the things they do is monitor whether or not elections are basically rigged. They monitor whether or not elections are fair. And they monitored that election in December, 2011, that parliamentary election in Russia, and they did not like what they saw.
Quote, ""The contest was slanted in favor of the ruling party."" There was, quote, ""undue interference of state authorities at different levels."" There was, quote, ""a lack of independence of the election administration.""
Quote, ""The elections were marked by the convergence of the state and the governing party"", Putin`s party. Quote, ""The playing field was slanted in favor of Putin`s party."" United Russia. The playing field was slanted.
And remember, these elections, even with all of that, they didn`t work out that great for Putin`s party. They lost dozens of seats. They did hold on to their majority in parliament, but just barely.
And these very serious questions were raised by very serious elections monitors as to whether or not Putin and his party had to actually cheat in order to just even keep that bare majority. I mean, here`s the OSCE talking about how the vote counting went during the election that night in December, 2011.
Check this out, quote, ""The quality of the process deteriorated considerably during the count, which was characterized by frequent procedural violations and instances of apparent manipulation including several serious indications of ballot box stuffing."" So, this is interesting, right? In other words, they`re saying the count maybe started off okay, the election wasn`t very fair, there was stuff going wrong, but the count started off okay but didn`t end up okay.
When they started to realize what the count was showing in terms of how Russians voted, what was the phrase? ""The quality of the process deteriorated considerably."" And by the end of the counting, they were just blatantly stuffing the ballot boxes. And then they only held on to their majority by a hair.
So, this happened in December, 2011. It was a shock to Putin, it was a challenge to Putin, it was an indication that if Russians got to vote freely and fairly, maybe Russians were about to pick somebody else to run their country, for the first time since Yeltsin when he quit on Y2K, which was so weird.
But when these results came in, when the results were announced, when this accounting process, such as it was, was complete and Russians realized that this is the way Putin was going to hold on to power, a lot of Russians took to the streets.

REPORTER: This week in Moscow, thousands of protesters faced off against police. ""Russia without Putin and Putin is a thief,"" they shouted. Rare public defiance following Prime Minister Vladimir Putin`s surprisingly weak showing in Sunday`s parliamentary election and allegations of widespread fraud.
Even Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was critical, prompting Putin to accuse her of inciting the unrest. But the alleged fraud was all over the Internet. YouTube videos like this one.
An election official is confronted after he appears to be filling out multiple ballots.
Human rights groups say more than 1,000 people have been arrested since Monday, but the opposition plans another big protest tomorrow. By law, Putin had to step down as president in 2008, but he never really gave up control. Now, the former KGB strongman says he will run for the job again in March.
Protesters like these hope they can stop him. The white ribbons are the new symbol of their movement.
These guys have already handed out hundreds tonight. The ribbon says ""Against the party of crooks and thieves.""
So far, more than 35,000 people have signed up on Facebook to join tomorrow`s protest. Security forces are getting ready for what could be Russia`s largest political demonstration since the fall of the Soviet Union 20 years ago this month.
LESTER HOLT, NBC NEWS ANCHOR: Mass protests through the streets of Moscow. Tens of thousands of ordinary citizens rising up against corruption and their prime minister, Vladimir Putin.
NBC`s Stephanie Gosk is there.
STEPHANIE GOSK, NBC NEWS REPORTER: The cold and the snow didn`t stop them. The massive show of force on Moscow`s streets didn`t, either. Police estimate a crowd of 25,000, the largest political demonstration since the early `90s.
""Russia without Putin"" they defiantly chanted.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
MADDOW: Those were days of protests. Days of protests. It was a different -- three different reports there from ""NBC Nightly News"" over December, early days of December, 2011, the election was December 4th, the protests started December 5. That was five years ago, 2011.
These protests were really big. Some of the biggest protests against any Russian leader since the fall of the Soviet Union. Even the last Soviet leader, Mikhail Gorbachev came out and said that that election was a disaster, it should be scrapped and redone.
Gorbachev came out and said, ""The country`s leaders must admit there were numerous falsifications and rigging. The results do not reflect the people`s will, I think they can only take one decision, annul the results of an election and hold a new one."" Gorbachev said that, as thousands and then tens of thousands of Russians took to the streets saying ""Russia without Putin.""
I mean, this was a big deal. This was maybe going to be the end of Putin. I mean, people wouldn`t even have to overthrow him. This was December, 2011, he was about to stand for president in March just a few months later, and there`s the country rising up against him, feeling like he`s this corrupt thief who just rigged the election to stay in power and even still was only barely able to do it as the country turned against him.
It was an incredible moment, the kind of moment that could have changed the course of world events. But you know what? Vladimir Putin, he took that moment and he grabbed it by the neck and squeezed, as he is wont to do. He sent security forces, including the military, into the streets to arrest Russians by the thousands.
Opposition political figures picked up and jailed. The Kremlin organized counter-protests that turned into running street battles between pro-Putin sort of militias and all these people who were protesting against him. And you know what?
When it came to explaining what went wrong, you saw a reference to this in Stephanie Gosk`s report there in that first week of December, when it came to explaining to Russians what was wrong and what was going on in the streets and who was to blame for what had happened to his country, what has pushed the country to the brink like that -- Putin, of course, picked somebody convenient to blame it on, somebody very familiar to us.
(VIDEO CLIP PLAYS)
MADDOW: ""She set the phone for some of the activist inside our country. She gave them a signal. They heard this signal and started active work with support from the U.S. State Department.
The secretary of state gave her opinions about the election. She said they were unfair and unjust. She set the tone, she gave them the signal.""
That was Vladimir Putin`s press conference with his cabinet after the election, explaining what was going on with all those thousands of people in the streets. Those thousands of people in the streets weren`t aggrieved Russians. They were just puppets of Hillary Clinton.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
BRIAN WILLIAMS, NBC NEWS ANCHOR: After protests erupted earlier this week, Putin turned his anger on the U.S., blaming Hillary Clinton in a Cold War of words.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
MADDOW: At the time, it seemed so random to us in this country that Putin would blame Hillary Clinton for the tens of thousands of Russians protesting against him in the streets, you know, saying ""Russia without Putin"" and all this. But that really is what he did.
I mean, as our secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, had been so bold as to quote from the elections monitors who observed the Russian election and saw how rigged it was and so, therefore, obviously, those protests were all her fault.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
HILLARY CLINTON, THEN-U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: Concerning Russia, you know, we`re watching the election results with great interest. Clearly, the Duma is going to have a different makeup than it did before this election and we do have serious concerns about the conduct of the elections.
The preliminary report by the OSCE cites election day attempts to stuff ballot boxes, manipulate voter lists and other troubling practices. We`re also concerned by reports that independent Russian election observers, including the nationwide Golos Network were harassed and had cyber attacks. Russian voters deserve a full investigation of electoral fraud and manipulation.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
MADDOW: When Vladimir Putin was facing the one moment since he took power on the first day of this millennium, the one moment when it looked like he might conceivably lose his grip on power, while he was facing that, Hillary Clinton as America`s top diplomat, she did, she went after him publicly for rigging the election that kept his party in power and that gave him a position from which he was able ultimately to regain the presidency. While tens of thousands of Russians stood in the streets and braves mass arrests, you know, and shouted ""Russia without Putin"" and called Putin a thief and a fraud, the United States government in the person of Hillary Clinton our secretary of state, she stood up and said, yes, she said those elections were, quote, ""neither free nor fair.""
She said, in effect, those protesters are right. We the United States government believe those protesters have got a real beef with those elections for a reason. She said it. ""Your elections were neither free nor fair.""
And that incident from 2011, that incident and the grudge that Vladimir Putin still has over it, that apparently is what explains what just happened to our country and our election, at least according to the assessment of Russian activities and intentions in recent U.S. elections. This is just released late today by the director of national intelligence. This is from the FBI, the CIA, and the National Security Agency.
And I know you know this is out today, I know the bottom line you have already heard. But here it is, quote, ""We assess Russian president Vladimir Putin ordered an influence campaign in 2016 aimed at the U.S. presidential election. Russia`s goals were to undermine public faith in the U.S. democratic process, to denigrate Secretary Clinton and to harm her electability and her potential presidency.""
Quote, ""We further assess Putin and the Russian government developed a clear preference for President-elect Trump. We also assess Putin and the Russian government aspired to help President-elect Trump`s election chances when possible by discrediting Secretary Clinton and publicly contrasting her unfavorably to him.""
And you know, it is hard to imagine that there is a barrel of ink yet to be spilled on explaining the Russian preference for Donald Trump, and whatever it is about Russia that makes the affection so mutual to him. I mean, the Putin/Trump connection is very well-trod ground. Honestly, we still do not have an independent credible explanation for what exactly explains that bond of what appears to be affection and mutual support.
But according to the intelligence community, for Russia, love of Donald Trump is not where it started. They started out, the reason they did it is that they had an intention to denigrate Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in her new role as presidential candidate, to harm her potential presidency. It was only as our election progressed according to this report that Putin and the Russian government developed their clear preference for President-elect Trump.
Well, why did it start with the hatred of Hillary Clinton? Why was denigrating Hillary Clinton, hurting Hillary Clinton, hurting her electability, hurting her potential presidency, why was that the prime mover for Vladimir Putin?
Well, in the overt official assessment of the FBI, the CIA, and the National Security Agency, we`ve got it explicitly. Quote, ""Putin most likely wanted to discredit Secretary Clinton because he has blamed her since 2011 for inciting mass protests against his regime in late 2011 and early 2012. He holds a grudge for comments he almost certainly saw as disparaging him.""
It was that election, that election in 2011 where Russia`s -- where Putin`s party apparently rigged it and had to in order to hold on to power by the skin of their teeth which led to mass protests in the street which led to this huge show of popular support against Putin, risking his chances to be able to regain the presidency after almost 12 years of being in power when he was not used to being challenged, it was that election.
And Hillary Clinton playing this role for the U.S. government of calling it straight saying, yeah, it looks like that election was rigged. That`s what led to what happened in our election. This is his payback for that.
And so if this is right, if this report is accurate, the FBI and the CIA and the NSA have got it right, then we know why they did it and we know what they did. Quoting from the report, ""The Kremlin`s campaign aimed at the U.S. election featured disclosures of data obtained through Russian cyber operations, intrusions into U.S. state and local electoral boards and overt propaganda.""
All this stuff about who knows where the DNC data came from, who knows where WikiLeaks got it, maybe it was some 400 pound 14-year-old in a bed somewhere, maybe in New Jersey -- yes, enough with that. No. According to the FBI, the CIA and the NSA, ""We assess with high confidence that it was the GRU --"" which is Russian military intelligence ""that relayed to WikiLeaks material it acquired from the Democratic national committee and senior Democratic officials.""
So, now we know. If this is right, if this report that they released public today is right, if they got it right, we have learned what Russia did. We have learned why they did it. And we have also learned one final thing which is very, very, very important for all of us going forward and that`s next.
MADDOW: All right. This is I think the really important part. We have been told as recently as last night that unclassified version of the intelligence report on Russia attacking the U.S. election, we`ve been told that the unclassified version, the cleared for public version of the report would come out next week.
It was then a surprise today when it came out this afternoon and this publicly available report, this unclassified version of the report, if it`s accurate, it taught us a great deal about what the Russians did to influence our elections this past year and why they did it, which is very dramatic, why Putin had this grudge against Hillary Clinton dating back to a specific thing that happened in 2011, why he wanted to destroy her, where that came from. Fascinating.
If you haven`t heard this report, don`t be daunted because it looks kind of long. Actually, if you don`t read the evidentiary annexes to it or like the sources and methods introduction and all the -- if you don`t read all of the surrounding stuff and just read the report, it`s only five pages long. So, you can absolutely read in the one sitting.
The other stuff is good, but if you just want the nut of it, it`s only five pages. You can totally do it. I put it online tonight so you can find it easily.
But when this thing came out publicly today, there was one additional thing that this report taught us. It`s not about Russia, it`s not about Hillary Clinton, it`s not even about our last election. But it`s really important and it`s about our new president.
And what we learned today when this public version of this report came out -- surprise, it`s out today -- what we learned when this came out is that our new president will flat out lie to us, to our faces and even put in the writing, even when we can check for ourselves and see for ourselves that he is blatantly lying about a really big thing. He apparently will just bracingly lie to us about important national security stuff and we learned that today if we didn`t believe it before.
All right. This is not that complicated. This is the public version. This is the unclassified version of this report.
And on every page of this report, there`s a little box at the top. We`ve shown it here so you can see it. Little box that explains, it says this, ""This report is a declassified version of a highly classified assessment; its conclusions are identical to those in the highly classified assessment but this version doesn`t include the full supporting information on key elements of the influence campaign.""
So, they not only say that at the outset of this report, it`s literally printed on top of every single page in the report. They`re saying, yes, this is the public one, this doesn`t have the sources and methods stuff that might screw with our spies or whatever. But the conclusions of this report are identical to those in the highly classified assessment which we the public don`t get to see. Very clear.
Now, the highly classified assessment, that was commissioned by President Obama, right? He asked the intelligence community for it. He got that highly classified assessment from them yesterday. That same highly classified assessment that went to Obama yesterday went to the president- elect today, this morning.
And then, here`s the thing, right after that, right after he came out of that briefing where he received the highly classified version of this, he put out a written statement about what he learned in the briefing. And he blatantly and overtly, bluntly, simply lied about what is in this report, right before this report got publicly released so we could check ourselves and see that he was lying.
I have to say, I don`t get weirded out by that much stuff in the news but this puts a shiver down my spine. Look at this, it`s very clear. This was the statement our incoming president put out after he got highly classified version of this report. And, again, the public version that we all have now, that we can all see, its conclusions are identical to those in the highly classified report.
He gets briefed on the classified version of this, he comes out and he makes this statement, quote, ""President-elect Donald J. Trump released the following statement at the conclusion of meeting with intelligence community leaders.""
Here`s the statement, ""While Russia, China, other countries, outside groups and people are consistently trying to break through the cyber infrastructure of our governmental institutions, businesses, and organizations, including the Democrat National Committee, quote, there was absolutely no effect on the outcome of the election.""
So, he`s saying I just got briefed on this report, I met with the director of the intelligence, and the director of the CIA, and the director of the FBI, they`ve given me their report and I can tell you, the American people, having read this report, having been briefed by our intelligence community, I can tell you now that I`ve seen this report and I`ve been told what`s in it, there was -- what was it? There was absolutely no affect on the outcome of the election. That`s what he tells us.
Well, here`s what`s actually in the report. Quote, ""We did not make an assessment of the impact Russian activities had on the outcome of the election.""
So, our president-elect is lying to us. He says this report concluded that Russian hacking had no impact on the election. This report did not conclude it and now we know because we can read it ourselves because it came out today. Surprise.
And that`s a big lie. He also tells little lies, too. Here`s what he said in the same statement to us after getting briefed on this report. He said, ""There were attempts to hack the Republican national committee but the RNC had strong hacking defenses and the hackers were unsuccessful.""
Really? That`s what the report said? Because now I can look at the report myself now and it doesn`t say that at all. What the report says is, quote, ""Russia collected on some Republican-affiliated targets but did not conduct a comparable disclosure campaign.""
So, Russia was successful in stealing data and documents from the Republicans as well, they just didn`t blast it back into the United States as propaganda the way they did with the Democratic stuff because they wanted Trump to win the presidency. But the president-elect lied to us about that today. He lied to us about what`s in this report.
The president-elect either thinks we are idiots or he didn`t know that they were going to release the report today so we didn`t know we`d be able to fact check his statement, lying to us immediately against the thing he lied about?
We have posted the report online. We`re doing that tonight so it`s easy to find. Honestly, the meat of it is five pages but the whole thing is interesting. See what you think.
But also, do not believe a word the new president says on this topic until at least they correct the overt lies that they told about this just today.
MADDOW: We are awaiting a press conference due to start momentarily from the FBI and local authorities about the airport mass shooting that happened today in Ft. Lauderdale, Florida. Again, this latest update from authorities is due to start now. We`ll go to it as soon as it does start.
Unless you`re an air marshal, you are not allowed to bring a gun with you when you get on board an airplane. You can`t bring it on your carry-on luggage at least. But even if you`re not an air marshal, even if you`re just a regular Schmoe with a license to have a gun, you can bring your gun on airplane if you packed it in your chock luggage.
There`s rules about how it`s done. The gun has to be in a locked hard- sided case. It has to be unloaded. If you`re checking ammunition clips, you know, magazines with bullets those need to be in their own box, or included in that hard case with the gun.
If you do pack your gun and your ammo properly and when you get to the ticket counter, you notify the airline you are checking a firearm, that`s all you need to do. Those are TSA requirements for traveling with a gun. But that is what law enforcement believes happened today when a suspected gunman in the Ft. Lauderdale airport opened fire and killed a lot of people.
Law enforcement believes this young man packed a gun and ammunition into his checked luggage, then he retrieved his checked luggage from the baggage carousel after his flight. After he retrieved his luggage, he got his gun and ammo out of his bag and started shooting. Law enforcement officials tell NBC News they believe the shooter flew a red eye last night from Anchorage, Alaska, overnight to Minneapolis. Landed this morning in Minneapolis, then from Minneapolis, he took a connecting flight to Ft. Lauderdale.
When he landed at terminal 2 at Ft. Lauderdale, they think he retrieved his luggage from the baggage carousel, went to the bathroom where he got his gun out of his luggage and loaded it, then opened fire in the baggage claim. It was shortly before 1:00 Eastern Time these horrifying scenes today, people running out of the terminal on to the tarmac to get away.
We don`t know yet the type of firearm the gunman was using. There were eyewitness reports that it was a handgun but we can`t confirm that. People can also pack long guns on airplanes, shotguns or rifles, so just we don`t know about that yet.
There are reports he was able to reload his weapon at least once during the attack. The whole thing lasted less than 15 minutes. Police ultimately apprehended him without shooting him.
Apparently, he ran out of ammunition and that`s why the attack stopped. Witnesses say that he threw his gun on the ground after he ran out of ammo. He didn`t make a run for it. He just laid on the floor spread eagle and police took him into custody.
Tonight, we`re told he`s being interrogated by the FBI and by county investigators from Ft. Lauderdale.
Now, we`re learning tonight, late tonight, that federal prosecutors are preparing to file criminal charges against him. Federal prosecutors preparing to file criminal charges against him for offenses relating to interfering with the operation of an international airport. Other charges related to the people who he apparently killed and injured will follow, but this means this will proceed as a federal case and the FBI will take the investigative lead. We expect to hear more about that from authorities who, again, are due to give a press conference in -- any minute now.
This was a murder of five people all together. Five people were killed. At least eight other people were hurt. Many people who got hurt were taken to the trauma unit at Broward Medical Center.
As for the suspected shooter, we do know quite a bit about him now -- 26 years old, he`s American, his name is Esteban Santiago, he was reportedly wearing a ""Star Wars"" t-shirt during the shooting. He had been living most recently in Anchorage, Alaska. He was born in New Jersey, he moved to Puerto Rico as a toddler, joined the Puerto Rican national guard in 2007.
He also deployed to Iraq in 2010, spent about a year in Iraq on that deployment. Authorities say they did find his military I.D. on him today but he was discharged from the service last year for what the guard describes as unsatisfactory performance.
Federal law enforcement officials tell NBC News that this suspect was undergoing treatment for mental health problems. He`d complained he was hearing voices. NBC News reports a few months ago, he walked into the FBI`s office in Anchorage claiming that the CIA was forcing him to join ISIS. The FBI office then called the local police to deal with him and he ended up going voluntarily into a mental health facility for treatment.
In terms of the motive, we don`t know the motive at this time, but five people are now dead and eight others are hurt. Over 73,000 people pass through this Florida airport everyday. Today, this young gunman, for whatever reason, turned it into a little piece of hell on earth.
Again, we`re still awaiting a press conference from authorities in Ft. Lauderdale but we are hearing there will be federal charges in this case and that will mean the FBI is in the lead. We`ll bring that to you as soon as it happens.
MADDOW: Again, we are awaiting the start of a press conference that`s due to start 10 minutes or so ago in south Florida. This after the mass shooting attack at the Ft. Lauderdale airport today. We`ve received some news in the last few minutes that suggest this is going to be -- become a federal investigation with the FBI in the lead. We`re waiting to hear on that.
We`ve also got some further information through NBC News reporting about the mental health history of this shooter so we`re waiting for that.
We`ve also got Congressman Adam Schiff of California of the Intelligence Committee on deck for us tonight.
Lots still to come. Stay with us.
MADDOW: We knew it was going to happen some time. Today, it happened. Today, the incoming president decided to try to use his soon-to-be presidential power to come after NBC News. Quote, ""I`m asking the chairs of the House and Senate committees to investigate top secret intelligence shared with NBC prior to me seeing it."" The chairs of the House and Senate committees.
Last night at the top of our show, you might remember, we had a whole bunch of developing stories about the intelligence report that was about to drop on Russia attacking the U.S. election. There was new reporting on that from ""NBC Nightly News"" last night. There was new reporting on that from the ""Washington Post"" and a couple of different angles on it. There were a whole bunch of developing stories on the contents of that report that came out throughout last night and all the way through our show from 9:00 to 10:00 Eastern.
This is the report the nation`s top intelligence officials testified about yesterday in the Senate which they briefed to the president yesterday, they briefed to the top bipartisan leadership of Congress today. They briefed it to the president-elect today, as well as a whole bunch of people from hiss team that he brought with him to that briefing. I mean, a big multiagency report comes out on a topic of intense interest, it`s discussed in Congress ahead of time, it starts to formally get briefed out to lots and lots of policymakers.
And you know what? In Washington, inevitably, even before the public version of a report like that comes out, parts of it or stories about it get leaked to the press. Welcome to Washington, Mr. President-elect.
Quote, ""I am asking the chairs of the House and Senate committees to investigate top secret intelligence shared with NBC prior to me seeing it.""
What this is from the incoming president is an obvious attempt to intimidate NBC News. That`s not going to work. If the new president wants to initiate an investigation, he should know that he`s within his rights to try to do that in the executive branch. He can`t actually order Congress to do an investigation or any other thing. Congress is independent of the president. I don`t know if he knows that.
What remains to be seen, though, is how the intelligence communities are going to respond to him making this public cry. It`s not like the intelligence committees don`t have other things on their plate right now.
Joining us now is Congressman Adam Schiff. He`s the ranking member on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence.
Congressman, I really appreciate you being here with us on a Friday night. Thanks for being here.
REP. ADAM SCHIFF (D), CALIFORNIA: You bet.
MADDOW: So, the president-elect says he`s asking the chairs of the house and Senate committees. I think he means the intelligence committees, I think he means you, to investigate top secret intelligence shared with NBC prior to me seeing it. He`s talking about, I presume, the reporting that came out last night ahead of the public publication of this report.
How do you receive that as a member of the intelligence committee?
SCHIFF: Well, my reaction was really much the same as yours. Really? The president-elect is briefed on Russia hacking into an American election and further gets information today about the fact that it was not just designed to sow discord but rather to hurt Secretary Clinton and help his presidential campaign and what he wants to investigate is now NBC got some information about this in advance. Really? That`s what he wants the committees to be spending their time on?
It`s pretty breathtaking. But beyond that, we`re not the committees, indeed, the congressional committees aren`t the ones that do the investigation of leaks. That`s done by the executive branch, generally done by the Department of Justice. So, a little absurd in that respect as well but the bigger picture is, is this really your priority, Mr. President-elect?
MADDOW: Especially given what`s in the report that we`ve now all seen. Even the public version of this, the non-classified version of this is stunning. I mean, looking at the three-column headline across the front page of ""The New York Times"" tonight about the U.S. government concluding Putin interfered in the U.S. election in order to elect Donald Trump president and there`s a picture of Donald Trump as president-elect. It`s a moment in history we are living through right now.
Did your understanding of what the Russians did and why and its consequences change materially with the publication of this report today and the way that you`ve been briefed?
SCHIFF: It did. You know, I think it certainly underscored the enormous gravity of this. I have been briefed on a lot of about this over the weeks and months. We had a gang of eight breathing which we received in further detail today, which was in of itself stunning.
But what I came away with was that fact that we really need, Democrats and Republicans, to work together, to push back hard, to develop a comprehensive approach to all of the vectors of the Russian covert action plans for the United States and the rest of the world, that is as this report shows, they used paid social media trolls, they have their slick TV platforms, they use bribery and extortion in Europe, they use hacking and dumping of documents, they use dumping of forged documents.
They`re attacking all of liberal democracy. Not just the U.S., not this one election and we in Congress need to be able to work with this new president to push back and fight against that, and that has to start with him accepting what has happened. We need him to step up. He`s going to be president of the United States and he needs to lead in this assault on liberal democracy.
MADDOW: Congressman, there was something that happened this morning before -- just before the public version of this report came out that has shaken me a little bit, and I don`t think of myself as a person who gets sort of buffeted by what happens in the news. I`m not that cynical but most things don`t personally bother me.
I`m personally bothered by the fact that the president-elect came out after his classified briefing getting the highly classified assessment of this version came out and said there was no impact on the election of this Russian interference. As far as I understand it and what seems to be explicitly in the public report, the intelligence community did not assess whether or not what the Russians did affected our election. Whether or not it can ever be known, they didn`t even ask that question.
When he says definitively it did not affect the election result, has that been determined by the intelligence community at all?
SCHIFF: No, that`s patently false and I think what the president-elect did was by trying to comingle the fact that there`s no evidence that voting machines were tampered with in a way that affected the counting of the votes, that somehow this means that there was no impact on the election. Well, that`s just not true. It`s not the job of the intelligence agencies to determine was this decisive in its impact on the elections.
But it`s quite obvious that the daily dumping of information that was damaging to Secretary Clinton and helpful to Donald Trump, that was enabled by the Russian cyber operation had a hugely consequential impact. It was part of the daily dialogue that Secretary Clinton had to confront when these documents were done.
So, there`s no denying that it was influential. Whether it was decisive, we will never know, and it`s not the job of the intelligence agencies to try to tell us that.
MADDOW: Congressman Adam Schiff, thank you for your time, sir. I know you`ve got a lot on your plate.
SCHIFF: Thanks, Rachel.
MADDOW: Appreciate you being here.
SCHIFF: You bet.
MADDOW: All right. We got much more ahead tonight. We are still awaiting that news conference out of Fort Lauderdale, Florida, after the mass shooting at the airport there today. We are expecting some new information from authorities there both about the continuing investigation, what will be the prosecution of the suspect who is in custody and his background. So, stay with us on that.
MADDOW: I want to give you a bit of an eye-popping update on a story that we covered earlier this week that we got tons of reaction from you guys. We heard from lots and lots and lots of viewers on this. It was Wednesday night`s show.
We reported on what we saw as the early emergence of what looks like it may end up being the anti-Trump movement in this country and as part of that reporting we spoke to one of the authors of the ""Indivisible"" guide.
The ""Indivisible"" thing was put together by congressional staffers as basically a how-to guide for resisting the Trump agenda at a grassroots level. It essentially lays out in very practical terms how people can pressure your own members of Congress. That`s an important part of it. It has to be your own members of Congress to turn the national tied against Trump`s agenda, to stop him from accomplishing what he wants to accomplish in Washington.
Employs a very similar strategy to what the Tea Party did in 2009 to thwart President Obama`s agenda when he was way more popular than Donald Trump is now and had way bigger majorities in Congress in support of him. If the Tea Party could accomplish as much as they did in 2009, imagine what an anti-Trump movement using those same tactics could do now. That`s the basic idea.
So, we covered that on Wednesday night. Today, one of the leaders wrote to us to give us an update on the number of groups, anti-Trump groups that have been formed through the ""Indivisible"" website and sort of registered through the ""Indivisible"" website.
When we talked to that founder on Wednesday, he said that he was amazed. He said something like 350 people had already founded groups and registered them through the ""Indivisible"" website. It`s now over 1,550. That`s since Wednesday. Today is Friday.
They also told us their website traffic has nearly tripled to 1.7 million page views and almost 300,000 versions of this how-to guide have been downloaded since Wednesday.
So, we reported on that on Wednesday because we saw this starting to pop up around the country. It`s really started to pop up now.
Stay with us.
MADDOW: As I have mentioned, we have been waiting for the start of this press conference at the Fort Lauderdale Airport. It`s getting underway right now.
SHERIFF SCOTT ISRAEL, BROWARD COUNTY, FL: And then I`ll turn the conference over to the airport director, Mark Gale. And then we`ll conclude with the FBI SAC George Pirro, and then the three of us will take any questions.
The day began around 12:55 p.m. when an American subject by the name of Esteban Santiago landed in the Fort Lauderdale Airport Terminal 2 on a flight from Minnesota, Delta flight from Minnesota to Fort Lauderdale. He eventually retrieved a firearm and began indiscriminately shooting.
This cowardly heinous act resulted in the deaths of five people. There were 8 more people injured by way of gunshot that were transported to local hospitals. There were at least 30 to 40 more people that went to the hospitals for various injuries, falling, contusions, broken bones, strains, sprains and things of that nature.
The subject was immediately taken into custody by Broward sheriff`s deputies without incident. The subject was interviewed extensively by a team of FBI agents and Broward sheriff`s deputies. The subject is now in federal custody. And SAC Pirro will be speaking about that in a few moments.
The subject at this point as I said is an American citizen and the investigation continues. We bussed maybe thousands of people from off of airplanes from baggage, waiting in lines, to the port. Terminal 4 at the port and the Red Cross and many other agencies are coming together to assist these people.
As tragic as this incident is, and continues to be I`ve never been so proud of local, state and federal law enforcement. The FBI, the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, the Broward sheriff`s office and many local public safety agencies came together and worked with complete cohesion. The entire law enforcement and public safety community work tirelessly today and continues to work tirelessly as we continue this investigation.
At this time, I`ll bring up Mark Gale.
MARK GALE, FT. LAUDERDALE AIRPORT DIRECTOR: Thank you, Sheriff. I`m Mark Gale, airport director.
First, I`d like to say, again, on behalf of Broward County administration, our mayor, county commissioners, express our condolences and our sympathies and keep our thoughts and prayers that lost their lives here today, as well as their family and friends.
THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED."
0	16	 17 von 72	MSNBC	January 6, 2017 Friday	 ALL IN with CHRIS HAYES	 8:00 PM EST	"HIGHLIGHT: President-elect Donald Trump`s transition team has signaled to congressional Republican leaders that his preference is to fund the border wall through the appropriations process. The move would break a key campaign promise when Trump repeatedly said he would force Mexico to pay for the construction of the wall along the border. Trump explained that the idea is to speed up the process by obtaining funding now through Congress and getting Mexico pay it back later. Three companies filed liens against the Trump Organization at the end of 2016 claiming they have not been paid more than $5 million for work on the Trump International Hotel in Washington, D.C. The U.S. Congress on Friday certified the Electoral College vote that gave Republican Donald Trump his victory in the contentious 2016 presidential election. Trump had his long-anticipated briefing on the matter with top U.S. Intelligence officials at Trump Tower and we now know what he was told. Shortly after the meeting, the intelligence community released a declassified version of its comprehensive report on Russia`s interference in the 2016 election; Five people are dead, eight more wounded after a gunman, Esteban Santiago, opened fire in a baggage area at the Fort Lauderdale Airport. The suspected gunman is in custody

"	"JOY-ANN REID, MSNBC NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Tonight on ALL IN.
DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT-ELECT OF THE UNITED STATES: Putin is a strong leader.
REID: Ordered by Putin.
TRUMP: No puppet, no puppet.
REID: America`s intelligence chiefs meet face to face with Donald Trump and tell him ""Vladimir Putin ordered an influence campaign"" in the 2016 election and had a ""Clear preference for President-elect Trump.""
TRUMP: I love WikiLeaks.
REID: Tonight, the jaw-dropping and now public intelligence report detailing Russia`s efforts to elect Donald Trump, and why Trump still refuses to single out Russia for blame. 
Plus, today`s harrowing scene in Florida. We`ll have the latest on the mass shooting at the Fort Lauderdale Airport. Then --
TRUMP: Who is going to pay for that wall?
REID: Or maybe the American taxpayer. And how democrats are keeping the resistance going.
MAXINE WATERS, UNITED STATES CONGRESSMAN OF CALIFORNIA: Is there one United States senator who will join me in this letter?
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: There`s no debate.
REID: All In starts now.
REID: Good evening from New York, I`m Joy Reid in for Chris Hayes. And there is a lot to get to tonight, including the latest on that terrible shooting at the Fort Lauderdale Airport. But we are now two weeks from Donald Trump taking the oath of office as president of the United States and for months he`s been defending the president of Russia, Vladimir Putin and is missing all the indications that Russia played a role in hacking democratic officials while simultaneously praising WikiLeaks for releasing damaging information about his opponent, Hillary Clinton.
Today, Trump had his long-anticipated briefing on the matter with top U.S. Intelligence officials at Trump Tower and we now know what he was told. Shortly after the meeting, the intelligence community released a declassified version of its comprehensive report on Russia`s interference in the 2016 election and the findings are nothing short of explosive. In bold letters at the top of the report, this is the key finding, ""We assess that Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an influence campaign in 2016 aimed at the U.S. Presidential Election. Russia`s goals were to undermine public faith in the U.S. democratic process, denigrate Secretary Hillary Clinton and harm her electability and potential presidency. We further assess Putin and the Russian government developed a clear preference for President-elect Trump.""
The report finds not just that Russian Military Intelligence stole data from democratic operatives and institutions passing them on to WikiLeaks to be released but that Russia waged a comprehensive propaganda campaign using state-owned media and online trolls to push favorable messages about Trump and drive negative coverage of Clinton. Now, you`d think all that would make an impression on the President-elect himself. Today he received the top-secret version of that very report complete with highly classified sources and methods delivered to him in person by the director of National Intelligence and the heads of the FBI, the CIA, and the NSA.
But in a statement released after that meeting, Trump still refused to acknowledge or accept their conclusions about Russian`s direct role, saying, ""Russia, China, other countries, outside groups and people are consistently trying to break through the cyber infrastructure of our governmental institutions, businesses and organizations including the democrat national committee."" Democrat. Instead, Trump seems more focused on the validity of his own victory than on Russia`s attempt to disrupt American democracy claiming, ""There was absolutely no effect on the outcome of the election, including the fact that there was no tampering whatsoever with voting machines.""
The intelligence community never claimed that Russia`s interference had an impact on the election results. In fact, the report states right off the top that that was never their mission. ""We did not make an assessment of the impact that Russian activities had on the outcome of the 2016 election. The U.S. Intelligence Community is charged with monitoring and assessing the intentions, capabilities and actions of foreign actors, it does not analyze U.S. Political processes or U.S. Public opinion."" So regardless of whether Russia succeeded at influencing the election results the report states unequivocally that they -- unequivocally that they sure tried. I`m joined by Senator Jeff Merkley, democrat from Oregon. And Senator Merkley, when you read this report and were briefed on this report, what was your reaction?
JEFF MERKLEY, UNITED STATES SENATOR FOR OREGON: I was really shocked at how clear it is, this massive effort of Russian hacking, of course, hacking the DNC and officials like John Podesta associated with it. Also an extensive, extensive false news operation and then amplifying that false news with a team of trolls and bloggers operating out of Petersburg. And so it lays it out and it`s available for everyone in America to read and quite frankly when you see they worked so hard to amplify the themes of the Trump campaign and to denigrate Secretary Clinton in case after case after case attacking her health and her integrity, these false news stories, I want to emphasize that, these false news stories coming out of Russian, being amplified by them trying to pull down her campaign.
REID: Yes. And there`s even a part in the report where they -- where they state when it appeared to Moscow Secretary Clinton was likely to win, they shifted their efforts toward undermining her expected presidency, meaning that they meant the damage to Clinton to radiate into her potential presidency, meaning probably your colleagues on the other side of the aisle would use this as far to keep investigating her.
MERKLEY: Yes. They sure did. They had a whole campaign prepared to delegitimize her victory and then they took that down when they somewhat unexpectedly found out Trump had won and then they were popping campaign corks, they were celebrating. They felt they had a significant impact in affecting the U.S. Election.
REID: And you talk about amplifying the messages that were -- the false news, the false reports being amplified. One of the people amplifying that stuff was Donald Trump and I`m wondering what you make of the fact without Trump himself amplifying that false news stuff on the stage, at his rallies, really even in a sense even inflating some of the things that were in the WikiLeaks which, you know, were pretty snarky benign e-mails, what do you make of the fact that this couldn`t have succeeded without help from him?
MERKLEY: Well, I`ll tell you. It`s really hard to get your hands around how this worked in the sense that when Trump took on a theme, to some degree that theme was also taken up by the Russian operation, amplifying and that`s often how a third-party campaign works in the United States when your -- you have a wall between the campaign and the thirty party and the third party said, we`ll see what the campaign does and it help amplify it. I can`t -- I can`t say clearly, no one can at this point, how much influence the Russian propaganda operation had as compared to the statements that Trump himself made but in both cases they were often completely 100 percent off-track and wrong and that`s what`s really disturbing here is the generation of false stories -- the hacking, all directed at influencing the outcome of the presidential election, it cast quite a shadow over the incoming presidency.
REID: And really quickly, it could potentially cast a shadow over the senate. The Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has shown no interest in having a special, you know, standing committee the way they had for Benghazi and some other things. You do have John McCain attempting to do an investigation. Do you foresee the senate doing anything about the information in this report?
MERKLEY: John McCain really recognizes what a serious assault this is on the foundation of our democratic republic and I applaud him for it, we should be hearing that from every leader in this country. This is -- John McCain called it an act of war. It is certainly a major assault on the United States system of democracy.
REID: Indeed.
MERKLEY: And it should be thoroughly analyze, extensively analyzed by a bipartisan committee in the public, not in the secret halls of just the intelligence committee working -- majority get trapped and never let out -- a public bipartisan commission. You`re welcome, thank you.
REID: Well, Senator Jeff Merkley, thank -- and joining me now is Neera Tanden, President of Center for American Progress, Matthew Miller, former spokesperson for the justice department. And I`ll start with you, I`ll ask each of you. First of all, Neera, do you have any confidence that anything will be done about this? Do you have confidence in the senate? You just heard Senator Jeff Merkley say that he has confidence in John McCain. Do you have confidence in the senate?
NEERA TANDEN, PRESIDENT OF CENTER FOR AMERICAN PROGRESS: Oh, I sure has confidence in John McCain but John McCain`s committee is not enough. As you can see in this report there`s really breath-taking details, one of which is that Russia has a history of exploiting -- I think the term really is exploiting western leaders with business contacts with Russia because Donald Trump has never released his taxes, we don`t know what his business contacts would be. Seems like they are -- that`s an -- that`s an avenue of investigation and I think that`s one of the really critical reasons we need bipartisan, bicameral investigation into this which is independent, has a special prosecutor or has, you know, real power in the minority and the majority to subpoena, to ask questions, to really get to the bottom of this. I don`t have confidence in that happening now, but I hope, you know, truly true patriots in the congress will look at this report and actually act in the country`s interest.
REID: Yes. Absolutely. And of course, you were working with the Hillary Clinton campaign. Have you talked to one of your fellow members of the campaign to get their reaction to this report?
TANDEN: Just a few and it is really breath taking. I mean, the level of detail, the clarity. I mean, you -- I hope every American reads this report, reads it for themselves to see our intelligence community speaking in one very clear voice about the fact that Russia intended to help elect Donald Trump and, frankly, his reactions make it clear that he knows it. I mean, obviously why wouldn`t you just say in your statement today that Russia did hack, that they were out to help him. Instead, his actions are making it seem really -- like he`s guilty and understands that they helped him.
REID: And Matt miller, you know, to go beyond, you know, we`re focused a lot on what Russian Intelligence did in this report but it also does talk a lot about WikiLeaks, which is still out there, which still has the ability to obtain documents. We don`t know all of what they have and they could use it at any time. Are we not focusing enough on the potential damage that WikiLeaks could do whenever they feel like it depending on what they have or who they perceive to be their enemies in the moment, including being essentially enforcers for Donald Trump or Vladimir Putin or both.
MATHEW MILLER, FORMER JUSTICE DEPARTMENT SPOKESPERSON: Yes. I think that`s right. I think we`re just at the beginning of asking important questions here. We now know about the Russian government`s involvement. We know some of WikiLeaks` involvement but the question you raise is an appropriate one. There`s another question. You know, there are many, many ties that were documented during the campaign between Trump advisers and Russia and in some cases the Russian government or the forces in Ukraine who were backed by Putin and we really need to have an independent look at whether there were people, you know, connected to the Trump campaign or American citizens or others who were helping this undermining of the -- of American democracy by the Russian government. That`s something that, you know, this report didn`t get into but in the days to come, congress has to look at it, the -- I think there needs to be an independent commission that looks at it and potentially the justice department, maybe a special prosecutor.
REID: And, you know, Matt Miller, in this report it also talked about this being the new normal. That this wasn`t a discrete activity that we cannot expect to be repeated. You still have the RRT which is the propaganda arm for the Kremlin that`s still out there with even American, you know, American hosts appearing on it. You still got WikiLeaks out there. Do you -- do you -- are you concerned about the part of the report that said that it was also intended to undermine what they thought would be the next president of the United States? Meaning this was an operation that would have continued had Hillary Clinton been elected.
MILLER: Yes. And they`re not going to -- and they`re not going to stand it down just because she lost. I mean, you have to think -- if you look at what WikiLeaks was doing today, WikiLeaks was tweeting basically the same things that Trump was tweeting today, attacking the conclusions of this report before it came out, attacking the people that support it. So, you know, it looks like WikiLeaks is going to be an ongoing force backing up the Trump administration. They talked today, said something today about assembling reports on people -- about people who will are tweeting so, you know, there is a real concern that you will have a foreign government in cahoots with a shadowy online organization, you know, looking to undermine political opponents of the -- of the Trump administration. And I know that sounds conspiratorial, but we just went through an election where they did exactly that. So it`s -- there is real reason to be concerned.
REID: And same question to you, Neera, because obviously had Hillary Clinton been elected and this operation was not successful, part of it would have still been able to ripple into her presidency theoretically. Do you think that republicans are taking this seriously enough because Donald Trump is their friend now but, you know, your friends today can be your enemies tomorrow.
TANDEN: I mean, I`m frankly more concerned -- the report lays out the Russians hacked into the republicans but chose not to release the data. I think people should be deeply concerned. What is there? Could they release it at any time? Does that mean Russia has information today that could be deeply embarrassing to republicans and that`s something they can hold over them? I mean, again, it sounds conspiratorial but the reality is, it is laid out in this report. And what I would say to Senate Majority Leader McConnell and Speaker Paul Ryan, you both held dozens upon dozens of hearings on Benghazi, you have our entire intelligence apparatus of the United States saying the Russians tried to help elect Donald Trump and that they have the power that this could be the new normal. That they could use this information to affect Americans and American political leaders. What do you have to hide by not holding hearings? There`s not a single hearing in the house. How is that possible? How is it possible that they don`t care enough in the House of Representatives to get to the bottom of these questions? I think Americans -- republicans, democrats and independents should be asking their leaders in the house and senate to have a bipartisan investigation.
REID: Absolutely. You`d think all Americans would agree at least on that. We shall see how it goes moving forward. Matthew Miller, thank you for joining us. Neera is going to stick around with us.
And up next, the President-elect`s Twitter beef over the intelligence report and just who he`s picking a fight with now -- who he`s picking a fight with now. That story in two minutes.
REID: It may take lawmakers weeks or maybe months to fully digest the bombshell report on Russia`s attack on the U.S. Election but Donald Trump seems to have his own fixations. Last night, NBC news revealed details on the report and this morning Trump tweeted that he`s, ""Asking the chairs of the house and senate committees to investigate top secret intelligence shared with NBC prior to me seeing it."" He wants a congressional investigation into the leak. But an aide for the senate intelligence committee told NBC News they`ve not received a formal request for an investigation from Trump or his team. And a spokesperson for the house intelligence committee said it had not received an official request.
Whether or not they do, however, or rather chilling message has been sent, including to the intelligence community. Trump may not be interested in punishing Russia for hacking the U.S., but he`s real interested in punishing government officials for doing things that displease him. Neera Tanden is still with us and joining the discussion, Missouri Secretary of State, Jason Candor, former candidate for U.S. Senate. And Jason, I`ll start with you on this because we`ve never had a president like Donald Trump. He`s been compared to Richard Nixon, you know, and he has some Nixonian qualities but you`re talking about a particularly vengeful spirit. Somebody who Omarosa who worked with him on ""The Apprentice"" said he wants to see everyone who ever hurt bow down. And now you`re giving that a guy a mince power.
And let`s look at what he`s done before he`s gotten in. He wakes up this morning and rather than thinking about national security he`s criticizing Celebrity Apprentice, putting down Arnold Schwarzenegger. He goes in lobbies against the Ohio Republican Party Chairman to oust him for daring to not be for him during the campaign, and then he did something that doesn`t seem like it hurts him but it hurts us, pulling all the ambassadors in a precedent-breaking move denies every single U.S. Envoy, every ambassador, an extension past inauguration day. What do we make of this?
JASON CANDOR, MISSOURI SECRETARY OF STATE: You know, every time we talk about his tweets, which are basically the only way he makes public pronouncements anymore. I think we should talk about them as what they are, they`re policy positions of the United States. And that`s really the problem with the president who`s constantly putting his own insecurity on display. It`s no longer the case that there`s a kind of whacky guy running for president who tweets a bunch of stuff.
These are policy positions of the United States, never minding the fact that it`s completely ridiculous that the United States now has a position on how Arnold Schwarzenegger is doing on Celebrity Apprentice, but how about the fact that the policy position of the United States in a couple weeks when he becomes president seems to be that the intelligence community in order to prove something that we all pretty well knew was the case, like the Russian hack, had to divulge all sorts of evidence that they usually would haven`t to divulge publicly, which has a real consequence because now if you`re an adversary of the United States seeking to do harm to us through cyber-attack, well, now you know how other people got caught because they`ve been forced to show their math. And that`s because he`s limiting his policy positions to 140 characters and those are now the policy positions of our country.
REID: And Neera, not only that, I mean, this is a guy who did threaten to lock up Hillary Clinton who`s campaign you work forward to lock up his political opponent, something we don`t usually do in the United States. But now he is calling for an investigation asking congress -- the republicans in congress to investigate the intelligence community for leaking to NBC news. What kind of a precedent is that setting?
TANDEN: Let`s be crystal clear about this, what`s happening. OK. Donald Trump does not care, has exhibited almost zero interest in who leaked to WikiLeaks, right? He -- you know, someone targeted American -- you know, his opponents in order to at least undermine democracy, now we know it`s to help his campaign, hasn`t expressed any interest in that source of leaks. But one leak to NBC to explain what actually happened here, that`s who he`s going to go against. And I think I have to say it`s just frankly chilling that someone who is going to control the FBI is going to oversee the FBI, who`s going to oversee intelligence itself, who`s going to oversee the IRS, has essentially a vendetta via Twitter and I hope it`s just -- I hope, I hope it just maintains itself to Twitter but I think people can have real concerns about a president who`s so interested in exacting revenge against people who disagree with him. I mean, it`s just ridiculous to me that he care -- it seems to me he cares a little bit more about the ratings of the Celebrity Apprentice than Russian hacking into our election.
REID: Yes. And he`s the executive producer of The Apprentice. If it didn`t do well, he shouldn`t be flagging the show, it`s his show. Jason, you know, I mean, but I think that`s the serious point, right? Is that you`re giving somebody who`s showed he`s incredibly thin-skinned, who can`t stop talking about the election, he was tweeting again this morning re- describing his election victory and insisting that two weeks before the Clinton campaign knew he was going to win and they cancel (INAUDIBLE) -- I mean, he`s so obsessed with this but he`s also a vengeful person, you know that through his entire public life. Does it concern you that somebody that vengeful will have control of the FBI, the NSA, the CIA? I mean, you think of the possibilities.
CANDOR: It`s frightening. I mean, if you live in the United States of America, you have to be concerned about this. If your inferiority complex cannot be in any way assuaged by becoming President of the United States, then it`s pretty bad. And when you run for office, one of the things that happens is people say this interesting compliment to you sometimes, they say, ""You know, you really seem comfortable in your own skin."" Which is kind of a compliment reserved only for politicians. No one ever says, ""You know what I love about my accountant is he`s comfortable in his own skin."" So the threshold is low. But the reason people care about that is because it`s a very public position in which you have a high degree of power. And that`s anywhere in elected office. But we`re talking about the most powerful position that you can occupy in the entire world. And so as a result, yes, I think it`s absolutely a huge concern that now we have, for instance, an app that exists that -- the entire point of the app is to alert you immediately if the President-elect of the United States tweets about a publicly held company, presumably so you can get rid of the stock if you want to - we`re talking about American companies that the President- elect of the United States would take a position against.
REID: Yes. Can impact their stock immediately and we`ve seen it happen already. Neera Tanden and Jason Kander, thank you -- thank you both, have a great weekend.
And still ahead, Donald Trump`s backtrack on one of his most famous campaign promises.
TRUMP: Who`s going to pay for the wall? Who`s going to pay for the wall? Who`s going to pay for the wall? Who`s going to pay for that wall? You better believe it, and they`ll do it.
REID: Five people are dead, eight more wounded after a gunman opened fire in a baggage area at the Fort Lauderdale Airport. The suspected gunman is in custody and tonight we`re learning more about exactly who he is and what happened today. Joining me now with the latest from the scene is NBC`s Kerry Sanders. Kerry, what can you tell us about this gunman and about the wounded?
KERRY SANDERS, NBC CORRESPONDENT: We don`t have an answer, Joy, as to why the gunman did what he did. He`s been identified as 26-year-old Esteban Santiago. We believe he travelled from Anchorage to Minneapolis and from Minneapolis here to Fort Lauderdale where when he got down to baggage claim in terminal two, he retrieved his luggage. We`re told he checked his weapon in the luggage, the rules are you can, indeed, check weapons in luggage, notifying the airline. The weapons have to be separated from the bullets. Witnesses say he then went into the bathroom, loaded his pistol came out and started shooting. Now, we don`t know why. We do know he has reportedly had some mental issues that the FBI says in Alaska that he recently walked into the office there saying that the CIA was trying to force him to fight for ISIS, so it`s a very convoluted, disturbed individual here based on that story. The authorities right now have him in custody. Apparently after he fired his gun multiple times, we believe he may have changed out the clip in his hand-held pistol, a 9-millimeter three times, he then according to witnesses lay on the ground -- and lay on the ground as the authorities arrived. I`ve spoken to some of those who were in the downstairs area near baggage claim in terminal two who say getting out of here they feel lucky to be alive, it was hell. Joy?
REID: All right. NBC`s Kerry Sanders telling us that the alleged gunman said voices in his head apparently he was hearing in that horrific shooting. All right. President Obama has -- President Obama has briefed - - has been briefed on the shooting in Fort Lauderdale while President-elect Trump tweeted out this afternoon, ""Monitoring the terrible situation in Florida, just spoke to Governor Scott, thoughts and prayers for all, stay safe."" Florida Governor Rick Scott arrived on the scene a short time later and here`s what he had to say about his conversation today, including who he spoke with.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
RICK SCOTT, FLORIDA GOVERNOR: I have reached out to President-elect Trump and spoken with -- to him and Vice President Pence multiple times to keep them informed and they told me whatever resources that we need from the federal government they would do everything in their power to make that happen.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Did you talk to president Obama?
SCOTT: I have not talked to President Obama.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Has he reached out to you?
SCOTT: No, President Obama has not reached out to me but I talked to -- I talked to Vice President Pence and President-elect -- President-elect Trump and Vice president-Elect Pence quite a few times. Just to keep them informed.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Did you reach out to the Obama?
SCOTT: I have not.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Did President-elect Trump contact you or did you reach out to him?
SCOTT: I reached out to President-elect Trump and Vice President-Elect Pence.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: But you didn`t call the president? You called the President-elect? You didn`t call --
SCOTT: Absolutely.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Would it be appropriate to call the president for resources?
SCOTT: I have -- I have a personal relationship with Vice President Pence and President-elect Trump and I reached out.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
REID: Then, late tonight, Governor Scott`s schedule was amended and he did speak with the current President of the United States.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
SCOTT: The president called me probably now 30 minutes ago. He, of course, you know, said his prayers are with everybody that was impacted, said that anything we need to make sure I gave him a call, so appreciate it when something like this happens, you know, that you have the support of the federal government.

DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT-ELECT OF UNITED STATES: We are going to build the wall 100 percent and Mexico is going to pay for the wall.
Mexico will pay for the wall, OK? Believe me. We`ll build a wall. Don`t worry. We will build. I promise, we`re building the wall and Mexico will pay for the wall.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
JOY REID, MSNBC ANCHOR: Donald Trump has promised since the very first day of his campaign to build a wall of the U.S./Mexico border and that the Mexican government would foot the bill. Yeah. Not so much.
Today, the President-elect got slightly more detailed about who will actually pay for the wall and, surprise, it`s you. The Trump transition team and House Republicans have a plan, reports Politico, to fund the wall with your taxpayer dollars. You`re welcome.
In an interview today with the ""New York Times"" Trump explained that the idea is to speed up the process by obtaining funding now through Congress and getting Mexico to pay us back later. ""We`re going to get reimbursed but I don`t want to wait that long"" says Trump, ""But you start and then you get reimbursed."" Trump added in a tweet, ""The dishonest media does not report that any money spent on building the Great Wall, for sake of speed, will be paid back by Mexico later."" It will make a point (ph).
Right. They`ll spend $10 billion of American taxpayers` money to build your -- the Great Wall and then demand that a foreign country repay us for a project they oppose and that they`ve already said they have no intention of paying for. That should make sense. Perfect.
If you recall, Trump has already had the chance to deliver the bill when he met face to face with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto last August. But he apparently didn`t have the guts to make the ask.
Not only is Trump seemingly about to break a campaign promise with his new plan, he`s also breaking with the conservative financial ideas that Republicans claimed to care so much about.
And joining me now is MSNBC contributor and senior for Business Insider, Josh Barro. So Josh, do your fiscally responsible sensibilities have any problem with just, you know, we`re going to use $10 billion of our money now and then we`ll totally going to get paid back by Mexico who doesn`t want to build the wall later?
JOSH BARRO, SENIOR EDITOR, BUSINESS INSIDER: Oh totally. I mean -- so it`s funny. Because he said this -- and it always -- it felt like stick, like how could anybody really believe that this was going to happen?
REID: Yeah.
BARRO: The ""Washington Post"" actually did a polled back in September and asked people, do you think, Trump, if elected, will get the Mexicans to pay for the wall? And 21 percent of people said that they thought -- that he would do that.
REID: Yeah.
BARRO: So, on one hand, that`s a lot of people. On the other hand, that`s like less than half of the people who actually voted for him. So I think a lot of the people are voting for Trump, they realize that, you know, this was just a thing he was saying. It was not actually going to happen.
REID: Yeah.
BARRO: So -- and the other thing is, you know, he says, you know, $8 billion to $10 billion, probably actually going to cost substantially more than that if you really want a wall along the length of the border.
REID: Right.
BARRO: Trump has said well it could maybe be a fence in some places. So, you know, it starts adding up to real money, a billion here, a billion there. It`s something that ends up being a non-trivial item in the federal budget if we`re actually going to foot the bill for it.
REID: Well, you know, Donald Trump can probably get away with anything. You know, he said he could shoot one on Fifth Avenue, right, at one point during the campaign and he could probably get away with taking back and your take backs is on the wall. But members of Congress can`t and you can see in their reactions, that Politico story is fascinating. Because you can see they know they can`t go back to their districts and say there`s no wall.
So now you have Steve King, one of these Republicans. This is -- Dave Weigel reporting in the ""Washington Post,"" and he tweeted ""Just talked -- Dave Weigel just talked to Steve King and says -- who says if Trump can get funding for the wall from Congress, ""I`m not going to say let`s wait for the pesos"", aside from the fact of the, you know, where do you dispense there (ph). The Republicans in Congress feel like they have to appropriate money for a wall.
BARRO: Well -- and they`re in a tough place, right, because this is an idea that`s popular with Republicans but it`s not an idea that`s popular broadly with the electorate. You sort of get about 2 to 1 against the idea of building a wall on the border with Mexico. So, I think they have to be worried in both directions.
If they try to not appropriate the money to build the wall, then they could be attacked in primary. But if they do go along with spending what ends up being $20 billion or whatever on this wall, then that`s something they can be attacked for in the general election. So I think, you know, they have some time to figure this out.
The weird situation now is the law authorizes the President to go ahead and build the wall.
REID: Yeah.
BARRO: He just doesn`t have the money.
REID: Right.
BARRO: He can move some money around in accounts. He can go do his photo- op in front of a piece of wall they built with some money they find.
REID: Right.
BARRO: And then we`ll see what the state of relations is come April between the President and Republicans in Congress. There`s a lot of stuff, including Obamacare that I think they are going to find is much more difficult to reach agreement on than they thought it would be. So I don`t know whether Congress in the spring will be in a mood to give Donald Trump the money to build this wall.
REID: Yeah. So he could build a wall, not the wall.
BARRO: Right.
REID: Maybe it`s a little tiny wall.
BARRO: Right.
REID: Like a little six-foot wall.
BARRO: Yeah.
REID: But still, the other issue, of course, is the Mexico paying for it. That`s the other part of it. And he said I`ll get them to give it to me later. You had former Mexican President Vicente Fox Quesada who`s become an E-Trump troll and expert Trump troll. And he says, Trump, when will you understand that I`m going to pay for that f-ing wall. Be clear with U.S. tax papers. They will pay for it.
And the serious side of that is you cannot compel a foreign country to do what you say. Now Trump is making noises about renegotiating NAFTA and trying to make them pay that way. Isn`t there a possibility that you could just see bilateral agreements between Canada and Mexico that cut us out? I mean, there are ways that they could get around being bullied by the American president to give them 10 -- to give us $10 billion.
BARRO: Well, two things about that. One is, during the campaign, he actually had a plan about how he was going to get Mexico to pay for it. And that wasn`t a good plan.
REID: Remittances.
BARRO: Yeah. He was going to impound the billion of dollars in remittences they get sent from U.S. to Mexico over year and say I`m going to do the impoundment unless you give me money to build the wall. And the idea was that Mexico would have no choice because their economy depends on that. NAFTA is another point of leverage that he has, he wants to re- negotiate it. He could pull out.
So I think the Mexicans aren`t going to take kindly to that kind of brinksmanship. On the other hand, the Trump election has already been a disaster for the Mexican economy.
REID: Yes.
BARRO: And to the extent that Trump makes good on separating the U.S. from Mexico economically through immigration, through trade, through all sorts of things.
REID: Yeah.
BARRO: I think that can cause a huge economic mess there. Now, that said --
REID: Yeah.
BARRO: -- that makes it all the more emotionally unappealing for the people of Mexico to pony up to pay for this wall after they`re being bullied by the U.S. President.
REID: Yeah.
BARRO: So I think, no he won`t get them to pay for it but he can do a lot of damage.
REID: Do a lot of damage to their economy which, of course, then would increase up northward migration. So there you go. Josh Barro, thank you very much.
And still ahead, the planned resistance to Trump`s cabinet picks as they head to confirmation hearings on Capitol Hill. But first, we`ll check into hotel Trump for Thing 1 and Thing 2 next.
REID: Thing 1 tonight. When Donald Trump opened his D.C. Hotel this past fall, he said there was a key theme from the project that he wanted to replicate for America.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
TRUMP: My theme today is five words, under budget and ahead of schedule. That`s what we did. Under budget and ahead of schedule.
This is what I want to do for our country. And this is what we`re working so hard to do.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
REID: That`s six words. But anyway, as we`ve reported before on this show, the D.C. Hotel was not ahead of schedule. Multiple press releases about the renovation of the hotel -- which are still available on the Trump organization website, set the anticipated grand opening at the end of 2015, something he was even asked about in a legal deposition related to the hotel this past summer.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: This construction scheduled to begin in spring 2014 with an expected completion in late 2015.
TRUMP: OK.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: OK. Was that accurate at the time?
TRUMP: Perhaps. Yeah. We were very much ahead of schedule. We`re ahead of -- we`re actually ahead of schedule and we also went higher end than we even thought in terms of finishes and materials.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
REID: Again, they planned to open in 2015, they actually opened in 2016. Not ahead of schedule.
What about the second part of Trump`s theme that it was under budget? We have an important update tonight and that`s Thing 2 in 60 seconds.
REID: Donald Trump has a long history of stiffing contractors for work on his properties, and now we have an important update on his new D.C. Hotel. So far, three contracting companies who helped build that hotel say that they`re short more than $5 million and they filed liens against the property with the District of Columbia.
For instance, an executive from AES electrical says, ""We had people there well over 12 hours a day for weeks because they had a hard opening of September 12. But around the time they open, the Trump organization and its construction manager Lend Lease stopped paying AES which claims it`s still owed over $2 million.""
Another company, the family owned local plumbing firm Joseph Magnolia filed a lien for nearly $3 million. The Trump organization told the ""Washington Post"" in part, ""In developments of this scale and complexity, the filing of normal liens at the conclusion of construction is not uncommon as part of the closeout process.""
So, of the purported $212 million budget for the hotel, Trump is facing legal action for over $5 million in allegedly unpaid bills. I guess that`s one way to claim that you`re under budget.

REP. CARRIE MEEK, (D) FLORIDA: Mr. President, it is in writing and signed by myself on behalf of many of the diverse constituents in our country, especially those in the ninth congressional district and all American voters who recognize that the Supreme Court not the people of the United States decide this election.
AL GORE, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Is the objection signed by a senator?
MEEK: Unfortunately, Mr. President, it is not signed by one single senator.
REP. PATSY MINK, (D) HAWAII: Unfortunately, I have no authority over the United States Senate and no senator has signed.
MEEK: Mr. President, it is in writing and signed by myself and several of my constituents in Florida. A senator is needed but missing.
GORE: Is the objection in writing and signed by a member of the House and a senator?
REP. MAXINE WATERS (D), CALIFORNIA: The objection is in writing and I don`t care that it is not signed by a member of the Senate.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
REID: That was the scene on the floor of the House of Representatives 16 years ago as portrayed in Michael Moore`s classic documentary ""Fahrenheit 9/11."" When Vice President Al Gore had to oversee the certification of the electoral votes in one of history`s most contested elections. Members of Congress stood up one by one to contest the election results and Gore, the man on whose behalf they were protesting, had to shoot them down because they didn`t have the co-signature of a senator. Since then, the certification of electoral votes has been a more dry, mundane procedural routine. That was until today.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
REP. BARBARA LEE, (D) CALIFORNIA: Mr. President, I object on behalf of the millions of Americans, including members of the intelligence community --
JOE BIDEN, VICE-PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: There is no debate. Debate is prohibited.
REP. SHEILA JACKSON, (D) TEXAS: Mr. President, I object to the votes from the state of Wisconsin which were not -- should not be legally certified?
BIDEN: No debate.
JACKSON: Is there one United States senator who will join me in this letter?
BIDEN: There is no debate. There is no debate.
JACKSON: Just one.
BIDEN: The gentlewoman will suspend.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
REID: In the end today, Donald Trump`s Electoral College victory was certified by the Congress. Those protests today on the House floor as Congress is probably the last time that we`ll get to see Congressional Democrats symbolically oppose the election results before Trump gets sworn in.
But next week the real substantive opposition to Trump`s presidency begins. What to expect for that fight after this break.
REID: We are just a few days away from the first confirmation hearings for Donald Trump`s cabinet nominees, including six different hearings scheduled on the same day next week. It will be the first time Democrats have a chance to show what a substantive opposition to the Trump agenda will look like.
Joining me now, Wade Henderson, president and CEO of The Leadership Conference on Civil Rights and Human Rights, and Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers. Thank you for being here.
WADE HENDERSON, PRES., THE LEADERSHIP CONFERENCE ON CIVIL RIGHTS AND HUMAN RIGHTS: Thank you.
REID: Thank you. And Wade, I`ll going to start with you. Let`s get right to it. Jeff Sessions...
HENDERSON: Yeah.
REID: ... there will only going to be four witnesses, that`s going to be very limited amount of time two days, what one question do you want to hear asked of Jeff Sessions?
HENDERSON: Well, it`s outrageous Joy, that Senator Sessions nomination is going forward and his hearing is being held. And in spite of the fact that he has failed to provide essential information that the judiciary committee requires up every nominee who comes before that to be evaluated.
What`s really shocking in this instance, and really not shocking, but nonetheless embarrassing, is that the Senate has chosen to use its friendship towards Senator Sessions to cover its responsibility of providing advice and consent for the nominee. In other words, collegiality is trumping, if you will, the advice and consent responsibility of the constitution.
REID: Yeah.
HENDERSON: What I`d like to see Senator Sessions asked are his views about the voting rights act, about wrongful prosecutions, yes, those that occurred 30 years ago but, more importantly, about problems with voter I.D. today. About problems with efforts to move polling places in states like Alabama, his very own state. I`d like to see him asked about whether he can enforce statutes over which he has a hostility long established.
So, for example, he opposed the violence against women act. He has opposed the passage of the Matthew Shepard, James Byrd, Hate Crime Prevention Act. He has opposed other statutes that he is responsible now for enforcing. We`d like to see questions asked about that. We`d also like to see questions asked about his hostility to immigrants, his support for a Muslim ban or arguing that a Muslim ban is certainly worthy of discussion. These kinds of issues are frightening to the American people.
And I think the American people expect two things. One, they expect a procedurally fair hearing, but they also expect a substantively complete hearing. And neither of those will take place next week because the senator has not provided the essential information of a senate questionnaire that is required of every nominee before the committee.
REID: And Randi Weingarten, I have also the same question to you about Betsy DeVos who is -- DeVos-- who is being put forward as the secretary of education. What do you want to see her asked?
RANDI WEINGARTEN, PRESIDENT OF THE AMERICAN FEDERATION OF TEACHERS: Well, we know a lot about her record in Michigan. And her record in Michigan is -- makes it clear that this is the most anti-public education nominee since the position of secretary of education was established. And we know whether people were Trump voters or Hillary voters, they want a secretary of education that actually strengthens and improves public education where 90 percent of the children of our country go, of schools that are the anchor of democracy, the propeller of our economy, and, instead, what she has done in Michigan for the last 20 years is to destabilize, defund, and siphon off funds.
And, frankly, even for our colleagues and our friends who actually believe that there should be some alternatives, what she has done is actually made schooling worse in Michigan. So we want to make sure that people see the facts. What has happened is that 75 percent of public schools do better than charters, these for-profit Wild, Wild West charters in Michigan.
And in Detroit we see that 80 percent of the schools, the charter schools in Detroit, are failing. So at the end of the day, we don`t want to replicate that in the United States of America and we want to make sure that her record is clearly out there. We need a secretary of education who`s going to lift up public education, who`s going to help all kids succeed, not one who has a hostility to civil rights, as my colleague Wade has just said about Senator Sessions, or someone who has an antipathy towards anything that is public, in terms of public education. You can`t be about profit. You have to be about children. And we have seen no evidence that she is about children in public education.
REID: Well, very quickly I want to ask each of you. Do you anticipate there being something on the order of civil disobedience try to push Democrats to be tough on these nominees? And if so, is there a particular nominee that civil rights groups for you, Wade Henderson, are focused on frequently (ph)?
HENDERSON: Yeah, yeah. Well, I can`t predict what the civil disobedience will be involved but I will say this. It is very clear that opposition to the Sessions` nomination is building. We have 1,200 law professors from around the country that have expressed their opposition. We have former Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick in a letter to the judiciary committee stating his opposition and basing it on his prior service as an attorney for a defendant in a wrongful voting fraud case that Sessions brought.
REID: Right.
HENDERSON: That kind of effort is under way. So, we don`t know about civil disobedience but opposition is building --
REID: Right.
HENDERSON: -- everyday. And we anticipate seeing more next week.
REID: And very quickly, Randi Weingarten, do you anticipate civil disobedience over these nominees?
WEINGARTEN: Look, I anticipate a lot of opposition but you notice that Senator McConnell must be very concerned about all this because he`s having this vote-a-rama, he`s trying to flush (ph) things and push these things through.
REID: Put them all together.
WEINGARTEN: So -- exactly. So -- but there`s opposition around the country --
REID: Absolutely.
WEINGARTEN: -- and we`re seeing all that.
REID: Yup. Well, we unfortunately are out of time. Wade Henderson and Randi Weingarten, thank you both. Thank you, have a great weekend.
That is All In for this evening. I`m Joy Reid for Chris Hayes. And he will be back on Monday, and I`ll be back right here on MSNBC tomorrow and Sunday at 10:00 a.m. for AM Joy.
The Rachel Maddow Show starts right now. Good evening and happy Friday, Rachel.
THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED."
0	17	 18 von 72	MSNBC	January 6, 2017 Friday	 HARDBALL	 5:00 PM EST	"HIGHLIGHT: An apparently mentally disturbed young man kills 5 at the Fort Lauderdale airport with a gun he brought with him in his luggage. Interview with Senator Bill Nelson of Florida. The declassified review of Russia`s involvement in 2016 election was released to the public today.

"	"CHRIS MATTHEWS, HOST: A day of reckoning and horror.
This is HARDBALL.
Good evening. I`m Chris Matthews in Washington.
Before we get to the shooting down in Fort Lauderdale, I want to give the guts of the report put out earlier today by U.S. intelligence agencies. It`s devastating.
It states that Vladimir Putin himself set out to tear down Hillary Clinton politically, personally. When it looked like she was going to win, Putin and his henchmen decided to undermine her presidency, crippling it from the start by getting Americans and the world to see the election as rigged.
When the race got close, Putin decided to go for the kill and do whatever he could to hurt Hillary chances. RT -- Russian television -- was part of Putin`s operation, pushing stories that Secretary Clinton had poor health, poor physical health, poor mental health. 
Why did Putin do this? Well, according to U.S. intelligence agencies, he blamed Hillary for inciting mass protests against him beginning in 2011. He also had a grudge against her for what she`s said about him. We`ll get to that powerful report in a moment. It`s a big part of the show tonight.
We begin tonight with the breaking news out Fort Lauderdale, where five people are dead and eight are injured after a lone shooter walked into the baggage claim area of Fort Lauderdale International Airport and opened fire.

SHERIFF SCOTT ISRAEL, BROWARD COUNTY: Shortly before 1:00 PM today, we had an active shooter inside terminal 2, the lower level by baggage. The active shooter shot at least 13 people. Eight people, as I know right now, are in area hospitals being treated. I don`t know the degree of their injures. Five people have succumbed to their wounds and tragically are dead.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
MATTHEWS: According to the Broward County sheriff department, the suspect, identified as 26-year-old Esteban Santiago. Acted alone, according to them, and was taken into custody without incident. The sheriff said it was too early to discuss a motive.
Unsubstantiated reports that there was a second shooter created a chaotic scene at the airport late, and forced law enforcement to rush to a second site at the airport with weapons drawn. The airport remains closed even now.
Late this afternoon, we learned that President Obama was briefed by his assistant for homeland security and counterterrorism, Lisa Monaco. President-elect Donald Trump tweeted, ""Monitoring the terrible situation in Florida. Just spoke to Governor Rick Scott. Thoughts and prayers for all. Stay safe.""
Well, late today, Governor Scott spoke to reporters.

GOV. RICK SCOTT (R), FLORIDA: The state of Florida (INAUDIBLE) Florida, law enforcement in this state will not tolerate evil acts. Whoever is responsible will be held accountable to the full extent of the law.

MATTHEWS: Well let`s go straight now to NBC News correspondent Kerry Sanders, who`s standing by at Fort Lauderdale airport. Kerry, some moment there -- for a while there, we thought there was more than there was, there was another shooter.
KERRY SANDERS, NBC CORRESPONDENT: Well, you know, and the reason for that was in the chaos, people thought they heard gunshots in terminal 1. Then there were some reports coming out of one of the parking garages that there was a threat there. And of course, the authorities were responding, I mean, SWAT teams running with guns out and ready to respond. As it turned out, it was more of a panic of the pandemonium of the chaos here.
Right there, there are still thousands of passengers who are stuck here at the airport. The roads are closed, passengers being told to shelter in place.
But we have a little bit of a change under way. As I say that, over in terminal 2, they`re beginning to tell the passengers, who`ve been trapped inside the terminal or outside on the deck up on the upper level, which is where their departures are, that they will soon be able to leave the airport.
But their process of getting out is going to be rather complicated. They`re going to be escorted from terminal 2 to terminal 1. This airport is a large airport, meaning that folks are going to have to walk from terminal 2 outside, up to terminal 1. Hopefully -- no all, but hopefully, most will be able to retrieve their one. And of course, many people were separated from their luggage.
Once they can make their way up to terminal 1, they`ll start working on the logistics to get people out of here. At the same time, some passengers are being told that if they live in the area and their cars are in the parking garage, the parking garage has now been swept and there does not appear to be any threats there. The authorities went through with bomb-sniffing dogs. It`s a huge, multi-deck parking garage. And so it took quite some time, but they believe that there are no existing threats. And so those that are locals who have landed at the airport or were here trying to leave and have their cars parked at the airport will be able to go to their cars and leave the airport. But this is going to take hours upon hours.
And as I`m standing here, Chris, all the way on the other side of the airport, there were passengers who were inside terminal 2 who had to flee, and when they fled, they`d already passed TSA security, so they were inside the terminal, sort of out at the air (ph) sides (ph). And so they ran out of the terminals onto the tarmac, where the planes park.
Well, then they were told to run across the airfield, and so they ran across the taxiway, across the runway, and all the way over there to a light (ph) that you can see in the background. I`ll step out of the way, perhaps, and we can sort of show you way over there, where those passengers are. Because it`s dark, they`re not going to be able to walk back, so they`re going to have to work some sort of bus shuttle system to bring them from there back over here.
The real question, of course, is why did this happen and how did the authorities react? Those who saw the gunman say that he seemed depraved and indifferent to the way he just callously took the gun, reloaded a magazine. It appears to be .9-millimeter, based on the photographs that have been taken by witnesses down there, a clip that can go in.
To regroup on the story, he flew in, we believe, from Anchorage from Minneapolis, changed planes, went from Minneapolis to Fort Lauderdale, got off, got his checked luggage. In his checked luggage, there was a weapon. Witnesses say he went into the bathroom with his luggage, took the pistol out -- we believe he loaded the pistol at that point -- came out and just began firing.
And while the authorities have this 26-year-old, Esteban Santiago, in custody, there really is no answer at this point as to whether he`s answering any of their questions, and that`s the homicide detectives from the Broward sheriff`s office, as well as FBI.
MATTHEWS: OK.
SANDERS: And of course, the leading question would be why -- Chris.
MATTHEWS: Lots of information, but not the ultimate question, why would somebody do this? Thank you, NBC`s Kerry Sanders.
Pete Williams right now, he`s with us, he`s NBC News justice correspondent. Pete, what do we know about the suspect, about this guy Santiago?
PETE WILLIAMS, NBC CORRESPONDENT: So he is 26 years old, born in New Jersey. Then the family moves to Puerto Rico. He grew up there in Puerto Rico. He joined the National Guard there and was deployed briefly overseas. He went to Iraq. He served there about 10 months, came back five years ago and was eventually discharged from the military two years ago.
But he`s clearly somebody that had mental problems. And I should emphasize at this point, Chris, that the investigators that looked at this see no sign of any kind of terrorism here. They are not considering this a terrorism act.
What the authorities tell us is that just a couple of months ago, Santiago walked into the FBI field office in Anchorage, where he was living, and told them that he was hearing voices, that the voices in his head were from the CIA and that they were telling him to watch ISIS videos.
The FBI said he`s -- many of his remarks were simply incoherent. They couldn`t understand what he was saying. So the FBI folks called the local police. The police came and got him and said, You know, we need to take you for mental health treatment. And he agreed to do so, and his family members say he was receiving mental health treatment.
Now, we`ve talked to some of his relatives that live in New Jersey. They say that he seemed to be fine, but that after he got back from Iraq, he was having these mental problems.
So the real question here is, of course, as Kerry said, why. But in addition, why today, why Fort Lauderdale? There doesn`t seem to be any Florida connection connection. He`s from New Jersey, lives in Puerto Rico, went to Anchorage to find work, had a son there. Why Fort Lauderdale? We don`t know.
One other quick thing here is witness have said that he got in an altercation in one of the flights that he took. He got on a flight to Anchorage -- from Anchorage to Minneapolis last night, and then flew again from Minneapolis to Fort Lauderdale today. On one of those flights, he got into an altercation. But whatever it was, it wasn`t serious enough that the airline called the police. They didn`t do it.
You know, that`s what usually happens. If there`s a serious altercation, they call -- they notify -- the airline radios ahead and the police meets the person and questions them and maybe detains and charges them. That didn`t happen.
Finally, I would just note that many people may not have heard of this, but it`s perfectly legal to check a gun in checked bags on airlines. Hunters, gun owners, gun enthusiasts do it all the time. Has to be in a locked case. You have to declare it. And authorities say that as far as they know, he did that. He followed those procedures with his handgun.
MATTHEWS: Everything was legal until he began shooting.
WILLIAMS: Right.
MATTHEWS: What a country. Thank you, Pete Williams, NBC News justice correspondent.
I`m joined right now by Mark Lea, who was in the baggage claim area and witnessed the entire event.
Thank you so much for coming on. You`re on the phone, Mark. Give us a sense or give a picture of what you saw today as you stood there at baggage claim.
MARK LEA, WITNESS (via telephone): Yes, well (INAUDIBLE) after we had gotten our bags from the baggage claim area after we got off our flight coming from Minneapolis. We were just getting ready to walk outside to get our, you know, transport over to the hotel. And all of a sudden, I heard, you know, three quick, you know, cracks, what I thought initially was fire crackers going off, and I -- after the first one, I immediately kind of turned in that direction, which at that point was probably 80 to 100 yards away from me.
After I -- when I saw the second and third rounds going off, I realized, no, that was no firecrackers. That was someone who was shooting. Then I saw the -- you know, saw the shooter (INAUDIBLE) and then he paused very briefly, continued to shoot as he was walking up on the baggage claim area.
As he got closer to the -- you know, the carousel where they baggage (INAUDIBLE) you know, he continued the shooting. There was no rhyme or reason to what he did, how he did it. He was not yelling, was not screaming. He was just quiet, did not say a single thing. Just -- like I say, he was just basically a point and shoot.
He was using .9-millimeter, basically had an eight-round magazine in it. He had -- must have had two other magazines that was already loaded because he had very brief interlude between changing magazines. So he did about roughly two dozen shots.
All this took place over a course of about 45 seconds, so very -- very quickly happening for that (INAUDIBLE) but people -- once the first shots went off, people were just panicking, were yelling, screaming, were frantically running to the exit as much as they can.
The people that were by the baggage claim carousels were diving underneath the chairs, up against the carousels, you know, for protection, behind their bags and everything else. And he just (INAUDIBLE) just walked up around, just shoot from that point-blank range, some, you know, at, you know, 10 feet away or whatever the case would be. So it was pretty -- pretty stressful, pretty hectic.
MATTHEWS: And you describe him as not sweaty or desperate looking but just calm and cold.
LEA: Calm. Yes, very calm. (INAUDIBLE) like I say, he did not say -- speak a single word, did not show any emotion whatsoever.
MATTHEWS: Did he seem to single out anyone or it was just random killing?
LEA: No. He was just random point and shooting. He just... (crosstalk) started walking (ph) a path (ph), and anything that was in his way, he shot.
MATTHEWS: And what were the ranges...
(CROSSTALK)
LEA: ... male, female, black, white, no difference.
MATTHEWS: Was he shooting people right at point-blank, and then when people began to run, did he, like pursue them with the gun, or how did he get so many people dead and wounded?
LEA: Well, when you have basically three magazines that`s enough (ph) to hold eight rounds per magazine...
MATTHEWS: Sure.
LEA: ... that`s real easy to crack off a number of rounds, so -- but yes, he just (INAUDIBLE) you know, just, you know, methodically just kept walking around just shooting until he was out of ammunition. Once he was out of ammunition -- most of the shooting was around the carousel area, where -- like I say (INAUDIBLE) there of the people that hit (INAUDIBLE) deceased, you know, right there (INAUDIBLE) () I mean, so many (ph) people that he shot in shoulders and everything else, or just, you know, right there. I mean, it just...
MATTHEWS: OK...
LEA: ... a very surreal sight to see as you`re -- as -- after -- you know, after he got done shooting, like I say, I was kind of coming up around the back side of him little bit, watching out (ph) where he was and see if I could further (ph) people out of the airport, or whatever there`s some, you know, ladies that had falling (ph) (INAUDIBLE) time to get to out. And I can help them out and around and made my wife was out and safe and sound...
MATTHEWS: Oh, good for you.
LEA: ... I went back in and...
MATTHEWS: You got through this.
LEA: ... kind of got -- at one point, I was probably about 50, 60 feet away from him while he was still shooting. Once he got done shooting, then he basically kind of, you know, dropped the firearm down to his side in his right hand, kind of walked back toward the area that he was doing (ph).
When he got close to (INAUDIBLE) kind of door -- door three (ph) down there in the baggage claim, he basically just dropped the gun, made a couple steps, and then laid face-down, spread-eagled on the ground and waited for basically the deputy to come up. And once again, he still didn`t say anything and -- you know, I mean, the whole thing took place in about 45 seconds. The deputy came up probably (ph) behind him. He was on the ground for 10 seconds, waiting for the deputy to come.
I kind of followed the deputy up there, too, and just -- you know, just making sure because he was alone down there because at the time, there was no other deputies or anyone down on that main level. But after he had secured, you know, the shooter (INAUDIBLE) I stepped on the firearm just to make sure, you know, it was unloaded because I could tell because the slide action was back because I stepped on there until it was secured there about 20 seconds after, you know, the deputy secured the shooter, there`s another half dozen deputies came back in and rushed in, further secured the scene. And at that point, I just kind of started running around trying to comfort people or find out who needed help or whatever. And I kind of...
MATTHEWS: OK...
LEA: ... ended up the rest of the time (INAUDIBLE) comforting a lady from Council Bluffs who was basically shot through and through in the right shoulder, and basically, she was on the other side of her husband who was, you know, shot in the face, basically died on the scene there right next to another guy that was shot in the face, and just trying to console her and kind of keep her lucid and trying to minimize her going into shock anymore than what she already was.
MATTHEWS: Well, that was quite a report, sir. And I appreciate it so much, and take care of yourself. That was quite an experience to go through, and certainly hell to a lot of people involved. Thank you, Mark Lea, who was there at the event itself today.
Anyway, the suspect remains in police custody right now as they continue their investigation. For more on what`s next, we`re joined right now by former New York police commissioner Bill Bratton and former FBI assistant director Sean Henry (ph). Sean`s with me now, but Commissioner Bratton -- Commission, I mean, we live in a country with a 2nd Amendment, and apparently, you`re now allowed to carry firearms, even semi-automatic pistol with three clips, and you`re -- as long as you keep the clips away from the pistol, I guess, in your luggage, it`s totally legal. That`s what we face as a reality now.
BILL BRATTON, FORMER NYPD COMMISSIONER, NBC CONTRIBUTOR: That`s correct. Well, It`s always been a reality and (INAUDIBLE) lot of hunting weapons move through baggage. Let`s face it that he could have just a easily at Anchorage had that gun, not checked it, and started shooting people there. It just reinforces the idea of the availability of guns in America.
There`s not a cop in America, not a police chief in America that will not tell you that we are amazed that there are not more incidents like this. If this individual was, indeed, mentally deranged and that was a factor in this shooting, we have hundreds of thousands if not million of people that are dealing with severe mental illness. We have 300 million weapons in the country.
An awful tragedy today. We`ll see to learn from it. But the reality is in America today, you cannot prevent everything. And today, the actions of one man -- we`ve seen the chaos that that one individual caused and certainly the tragedy of those deaths and injuries.
MATTHEWS: So what do we do?
BRATTON: Well...
MATTHEWS: In terms of security in public places. What can do? Nothing. And you said...
BRATTON: Well, the irony...
MATTHEWS: I understand the fatalism of the thought because we live in a free country with a 2nd Amendment, and we live in a country like any part of the human race that has people with mental illness. And there`s a certain percentage of us who are defective that way. And there`s a certain number of guns, and all it takes is an overlay of a gun with a guy who`s defective mentally. I mean, it`s -- it`s mathematically, as you say, more likely to happen than it`s happened.
BRATTON: Well, that`s the reality we deal with. Fortunately, that (ph) we are able to prevent many of these that (INAUDIBLE) probably prevent more with better laws that -- ironically, I understand it was reported earlier in one of the newscasts that the Florida legislation next week is voting on a law that would allow the carrying of firearms in airport terminals. I don`t know if they currently preclude that or are they just going to enshrine it with a law down there.
But it will be very interesting to see what happens next week with the Florida legislature as to whether they`re going to allow guns on college campuses, as well as in airport terminals in light of what just happened in Florida today.
MATTHEWS: Unfortunately, people of sound mind are making decisions for people that are not of sound mind. Thank you, so much, Commissioner Bratton, for coming on.
BRATTON: Thank you.
MATTHEWS: Let me go to Sean right now. Sean, thank you for this. What -- what -- it`s not terrorism, it`s this other thing, human malfunction, human anger, going back to the post office kind of situations we all learned about all those years, just anger.
SEAN HENRY, FORMER FBI ASSISTANT DIRECTOR: Right. Well, you said it a little earlier. Right now, as this point in the investigation, the authorities are going to be looking a what the motivation it. They`re going to be looking at social media accounts.
They`ll get search warrants and subpoenas for e-mail addresses and for his residence, et cetera, see if there`s any writings, any communications he`s had with others, but trying to understand the totality of this to determined what actually caused him to do what he did.
MATTHEWS: It`s always interesting, in an intriguingly negative way, to think about mental incapacitation but competence. I mean, here`s a guy (INAUDIBLE) get an airplane ticket. He knows how to get guns. He knows how to line them up in different compartments, to follow the law, right? He knows how to find his way to that moment.
HENRY: Yes.
MATTHEWS: And then behave horribly.
BRATTON: No, that`s absolutely right. I mean, the mental health issue in this country is at staggering proportion. We`ve seen these incidents before. We have the free availability, 2nd Amendment, the right for people to carry weapons. How do separate those who are mentally incapacitated, those who have a violent streak, those who seek to do harm to law-abiding citizens. How do you cull them from those Americans who have the legal right to carry a weapon? That`s the challenge that we face today. I think that there`s got to be a review of that as we see what`s happened here in the last...
MATTHEWS: Are we a more violent society, sane or not sane? I was just in India for two weeks. It`s a very, what`s the right word, courteous country. People don`t blow their horns at each other. They show courtesy as they go in traffic. They`re not -- there`s not road rage going on. I - - I`ve always sensed, based on the stats, that not just counting guns, but other means of killing somebody, we`re a pretty violent society.
HENRY: Yes, there`s been studies that look at video games as an example, where there`s this certain permissiveness and kids kind of grow up in an environment where this is normal. And when they`re playing a video game, that this is part of the game, and life is not a game in that regard.
MATTHEWS: They think it is.
HENRY: Certainly not suggesting that video games cause people to do this, but when you talk about, what is the environment that enables people to operate in an irresponsible way, that could be a contributing factor.
MATTHEWS: Yes, like in the old days, when the mobsters began to dress like the mobsters in the movies. They began to act like the guys they saw.
(CROSSTALK)
HENRY: ... takes on a...
(CROSSTALK)
MATTHEWS: Anyway, it`s a horrible thing. And I just think it`s part of our free society.
And the -- well, you might say the fallout of a free society is occasionally people are going to do this kind of thing who have mental problems.
Anyway, thank you, Shawn Henry.
It`s a grim night. Boy, Friday nights.
We`re going to keep up with developments at the Fort Lauderdale Airport shooting, of course, but there`s a big political story today, of course. The heads of the country`s top intelligence agencies have now briefed president-elect Donald Trump. The day of reckoning arrived today.
And they told him it was Putin`s personal efforts to destroy Hillary Clinton that is behind all this. It was personal, it was political, it was Putin. They found out Russia conspired on all fronts to help Donald Trump, who they wanted to win. Those are the facts laid before the president- elect today. And we will see how he reacts.
That`s ahead.
This is HARDBALL.
MATTHEWS: Welcome back to HARDBALL.
For weeks, Donald Trump has questioned, if you will, the evidence that Russia interfered in our presidential election. Well, today, he was briefed by the country`s most senior intelligence officials.
A declassified version of that briefing was released to the public. And I have read it.
The report from the CIA, FBI and NSA states -- quote -- ""Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an influence campaign in 2016 aimed at the United States presidential election. Russia`s goals were to undermine public faith in the U.S. democratic process, denigrate Secretary Clinton and harm her electability and potential presidency. We further assess Putin and the Russian government developed a clear preference for president-elect Trump. We have high confidence in these judgments.""
I`m joined right now by NBC`s Ken Dilanian.
Ken, that could not be stronger or more clear.
KEN DILANIAN, NBC NEWS NATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT: Absolutely, Chris.
And it answered a question that we had, which is, what were the motives? There had been a little disagreement in the reporting about what exactly was motivating Putin`s Russia. Was it just to destabilize American democracy? Was it actually to elect Trump?
And the U.S. intelligence community concluded clearly that by the end they wanted Trump to win.
MATTHEWS: And in the beginning, they wanted to make Hillary look so bad that, if she did win, which they thought she might, that she would be already crippled as president.
DILANIAN: Absolutely. So, it was win-win for them.
MATTHEWS: OK, what stunned me, although I`m not always so naive, R.T., Russian Television, is a propaganda arm, pure and simple, according to this report.
DILANIAN: Yes.
MATTHEWS: Pure and simple. It`s not partially propaganda. It`s a propaganda weapon.
DILANIAN: U.S. officials, as you know, have been saying that for some time. But this lays it out black and white. This is the assessment of U.S. intelligence community.
They talked about how much Russia spends on R.T. They talked about R.T.`s role collaborating with WikiLeaks. And what is pretty interesting, it`s been reported that Michael Flynn had a relationship with R.T., Trump`s national security adviser.
He went to Russia.
MATTHEWS: Well, he better end it.
Let ask you. What stunned me was that the R.T. -- I don`t watch it -- I never will -- but R.T. specifically targeted Hillary Clinton for charges of mental illness, physical illness, but that she has a screwball problem. They pushed that story because Putin wanted it pushed. That`s staggering.
DILANIAN: And Putin`s personal role in all this, which is explored more in the classified version of this report, is also surprising. He had a hand on the tiller here. He was driving some of this activity.
MATTHEWS: And the fact he did it because he was mad at her, like a high school kid, because she said nasty things about him.
DILANIAN: And the report also says that the Russians are going to use this as a blueprint. They will do this again in both U.S. elections and European elections, unless something changes.
MATTHEWS: How will we know it was them?
DILANIAN: Well, that`s about the disappointing thing about this report. Right? It doesn`t lay out of the evidence. We know from our own reporting it`s based on...
MATTHEWS: No, how will we know in the future that they go after somebody in New York or they go after somebody in Arizona, they picked out a politician they think is anti-Russian? How do we know that it was them?
DILANIAN: So, the hacking, the U.S. intelligence community knows their signatures, knows the malware, can track that kind of stuff.
MATTHEWS: Are they going to tell us? If you`re Joe Blow and you`re attacked, and you don`t know who has been attacking you, somebody is saying terrible things about you, will the NSA now tell you, oh, we got to tell you who is after you?
DILANIAN: I hope they do.
MATTHEWS: That would be nice. I don`t think they will, though.
NBC`s Ken Dilanian, thank you, sir.
DILANIAN: Great to be with you.
MATTHEWS: Just hours before today`s meeting with the spy agencies, Donald Trump told ""The New York Times"" the attention focused on this issue was a political witch-hunt. I have no idea what that is supposed to mean.
Afterwards, Trump described the meeting, however, as constructive.
This is from Trump -- quote -- ""While Russia, China, other countries, outside groups and people are consistently trying to break through the cyber-infrastructure of our governmental institutions, businesses and organizations, including the Democrat"" -- notice that word -- ""Democrat National Committee, there was absolutely no effect on the outcome of the election, including the fact that there was no tampering whatsoever with voting machines. There were attempts to hack the Republican National Committee, but the RNC had strong hacking defenses, and the hackers were unsuccessful.""
That`s the statement put out by whoever works with Trump.
Anyway, Michael McFaul is the former U.S. ambassador to Russia and an MSNBC contributor. And David Corn is Washington bureau chief for ""Mother Jones"" and also an MSNBC political analyst.
Mr. Ambassador, tell me about your experience with the Russians. This fits -- this is like one of the old notions of the Russians. They are spies, and they`re relentless at it. Your thoughts? How does this fit, what you read today?
MICHAEL MCFAUL, MSNBC ANALYST: Of course. They are relentless at it. They have incredible capability.
They`re active every day. I just got a message from my Gmail account today that: We have reason to believe that a government-sponsored agent is trying get into your e-mail.
They have not stopped because of the sanctions a couple weeks ago. But, obviously, here what is different is, we all do espionage, we all gather intelligence. Putin made a decision to use that intelligence that he stole for political purposes. And I can`t think of a time ever in American history where you had a foreign policy so directly involved in the outcome of a presidential election.
MATTHEWS: This hatred of Hillary seems almost beyond politics. He is mad at her because she, what, dissed him? How does he see it? What can you read in that report?
MCFAUL: So, I have been with the two them together. I have been with Mr. Putin when he talked about our former secretary of state.
The thing that really bothers him is that, after the parliamentary election in Russia in December 2011 that was grossly falsified, and it was discovered that election monitors showed that, she criticized that election. She criticized that election that his party did poorly in.
And he was extremely upset about that statement, and he made it known to our president. He made it known to me, people in the government. And that`s -- there are other issues, but that`s fundamentally the source of the personal vendetta.
MATTHEWS: Place this politically in this election. I don`t know if people would say it changed the results of the election, but what do you think, David, purposeful conspiracy to get Trump elected?
DAVID CORN, MSNBC POLITICAL ANALYST: Well, that`s what the intelligence community has concluded. It certainly looks like that from the outside.
MATTHEWS: No, that that was decisive.
CORN: Yes. Well, what Donald Trump and his people say is, whatever happened -- and they don`t acknowledge it happened -- it has no impact on the outcome of the election.
But yet throughout end of the campaign, Donald Trump again and again and again was citing WikiLeaks. Look at WikiLeaks. He kept using -- he used the ammo that this operation produced quite well and quite repeatedly.
So, for him to say later, well, it had nothing to do with anything is just another of the many false statements...
(CROSSTALK)
MATTHEWS: I was at the Al Smith Dinner sitting up there at the head table when he came out and said -- made fun of Hillary Clinton and said she is here to prove she is not anti-Catholic, when in fact that`s exactly what came out the WikiLeaks thing.
CORN: And, again, David Frum had a good piece in ""The Atlantic"" the other day in which he talked about how Trump not only cited the WikiLeaks material, but he always exaggerated it, said it shows she`s corrupt, it shows she`s criminal.
MATTHEWS: Or that Donna Brazile is a media person, not a DNC chair, right.
CORN: So he used this.
You had Roger Stone, one of his unofficial advisers, saying, tweeting out, wait for the WikiLeaks drop. That`s going to change this election.
So, again and again, they used it, they cited it. And now after the fact, when it turns out, well, this all came from Putin, they say forget about it, it had nothing to do with the outcome of the election.
MATTHEWS: It did.
OK, according to a senior official who spoke to NBC News yesterday, -- quote -- ""U.S. intelligence picked up senior Russian officials celebrating Donald Trump`s win.""
The president-elect now, I guess, is the toast of Moscow right now.
But, Mr. Ambassador, what do you make of that? It`s not quite clear from the report we have gotten, the unclassified material, to what kind of a peanut gallery cheering section was this. Do we know?
MCFAUL: Everybody affiliated with Putin`s Kremlin and the government was fantastically enthusiastic about Donald Trump`s victory. You don`t need to read the SIGINT. You can look at my Twitter feed that night.
They clearly had a preference for him, not only because of what we talked about before, but because president-elect Trump has supported, on the campaign trail at least, many policies that Mr. Putin supports.
MATTHEWS: Sure.
MCFAUL: So, when he says, we`re going to look into recognizing Crimea as part of Russia, if you`re Putin, of course you want that candidate to win vs. the other one.
If you say you want to shake up NATO, of course you want that candidate to win. So, you don`t need a Ph.D. in Russian studies. I have one. But you don`t need a Ph.D. to kind of figure this out. It`s clearly they had preference for president-elect Trump, at least the Donald Trump that spoke as a campaign candidate. We will see what he does as president.
MATTHEWS: Let`s give him a little bit here. According to that same report today that was put out by the CIA, DIA, and the NSA, which is very credible now, high confidence in it, one of the motives for Putin was -- it sounded positive to me -- he wanted the United States and Russia to be part of an international coalition to get ISIS.
What do you make of that? That`s a good goal.
MCFAUL: It`s a good goal.
As we speak today, Russia is pulling out the Syria, while we are bombing ISIS in something called Operation Inherent Resolve.
So, again, I published a piece today in ""Foreign Policy"" saying, if we can cooperate with them on things that serve American national interests, that`s a good thing.
But that does not excuse them in meddling in our election. I`m sorry. Those are two separate things. And we have really got to take this seriously, because they are going to have this same capacity in 2020. It`s not like technology is going to slow down, if we don`t think of this as a national security issue.
MATTHEWS: And this is an escalation, as the report made clear today by the agencies. This is an escalation on what the Russians have been doing.
Thank you so much, Ambassador Michael McFaul. And thank you, David Corn.
Much more on the politics of this report and what it means for Trump ahead.
We continue to follow developments, of course, in that shooting today at airport in Fort Lauderdale, five dead, eight wounded. We will have the latest when we return.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The United Airlines terminal by the baggage. We were waiting for our flight at 7:00.
And we were talking getting something to eat, and then we heard bang, bang, bang, bang, ran out, my son and I, Clay. And we got separated with my wife and two daughters. And people were just running, just running for their lives.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
MATTHEWS: Welcome back.
Anyway, today`s shooting at Fort Lauderdale International Airport left five people dead and another eight injured.
And while there is no credible threat to any other airports in the wake of today`s attacks, security has been heightened around the country, obviously.
We have just gotten new pictures of Esteban, by the way, Santiago, taken into custody. There he is.
I`m joined right now by NBC`s Tom Costello, who is at Reagan National Airport.
Tom, we live in a world now where you can`t have a gun on an airplane, but you can one the minute you get off. You can have it in your luggage.
TOM COSTELLO, NBC CORRESPONDENT: Well, that`s right.
MATTHEWS: The Second Amendment is certain malleable. Go ahead.
(CROSSTALK)
MATTHEWS: Pardon me?
COSTELLO: No, you`re absolutely right. You can check a gun. You can check it legally
And the way that is happens is, you have to have had it in a locked hard- shell case. It has to have a lock on it. You have to separate out the ammunition from the weapon, and you have declare that to the airline.
Now, keep in mind there are many, many people who check a weapon, hunters who are headed to Alaska or Colorado or something. You have off-duty law enforcement officers. And you have gun enthusiasts who legally and responsibly check a weapon.
But this situation was something that nobody ever anticipated, that a potentially mentally deranged individual would get off a plane, get their weapon, and then go into the restroom, load it with bullets and start shooting people.
So, tonight, I can tell you the issue that is being discussed in high-level law enforcement circles is, do we have a whole new concern about the public areas that presumed were safe or relatively safe in an airport, and now we have not thought about introducing weapons in this fashion, and it creates a whole new dynamic? So, it`s a very big concern.
MATTHEWS: It`s interesting about how we have tried to evolve. It`s impossible to agree on this across the country about what the Second Amendment means.
For example, the Second Amendment does not allow you to carry a gun on an airplane, right? Why is that a place where you can`t carry a gun, where you can carry one in the baggage claim area?
COSTELLO: FAA rules and regulations, for obvious reasons, especially post- 9/11, do not allow a weapon on board an aircraft in a passenger cabin, although of course you will have some -- they`re called federal flight officers, I think is the correct terminology -- a pilot who is allowed and licensed to carry a weapon.
And that`s all post-9/11. But to this Second Amendment argument, there`s another dynamic here. I believe I heard you talking about it with Chief Bratton. And that is that New York is right now considering whether to legalize allowing people to carry weapons on college campuses, in government meetings, and in airport terminals.
Now, this has come up for a vote before, and it`s always died in committee because the committee chairman was not keen. But the committee chairman has now changed. And this new committee chairman down there in Florida has advocated for more -- allowing more open carry. So this is up for a vote in committee next week. We will see how that goes.
MATTHEWS: Yes, ""Gunsmoke"" is not just an old TV show.
Anyway, thank you, NBC`s Tom Costello.
Senator Bill Nelson is with us now. He`s a Democrat from Florida.
Thank you, Senator Nelson.
And I know you`re a moderate Democrat and I`m trying to figure out, where is this go? I mean, every time since Bobby Kennedy was shot and every time it`s a horrible incident with his Connecticut or it`s down there in Orlando, everybody says, well, we`re going to do something about this, and everybody just moves on to something else and rechecking the football scores five minutes later and thinking about something else.
Are we going to think about this or just move on?
SEN. BILL NELSON (D), FLORIDA: Well, I hope so, Chris, and as Tom pointed out, you don`t want to penalize the people who have legitimate uses for guns such as hunters taking guns on the airplane checked away, special compartment, special kind of luggage for the gun.
But, you know, what this really tells us this is a reminder of how vulnerable masses of people bunch together in small places. Remember last year the Brussels airport shooting. That wasn`t down at baggage claim like this was, but that was up outside the ticket counters and where people were queuing up to go through security. So, wherever you have these it`s going to be a soft target.
MATTHEWS: Yes.
NELSON: And maybe not just airports, maybe train stations, maybe seaports and tragically as we saw in Orlando, in a crowded nightclub.
MATTHEWS: Short of a constitutional amendment which will never occur in our lifetimes the -- which would take three quarters of the states to basically changed in any way, substantially, the Second Amendment and taking a ""que sera sera, what will be will be"" approached, what`s in the middle between doing nothing and outlawing guns? What is in the middle, Senator, to mitigate against these kinds of situations, these kinds of tragedies?
NELSON: Well, what has to be in the middle is some kind of check, where there is reasonable reason to check common sense. Now, in this instant case, if this fellow had a mental illness and indeed it had been identified is a people with mental illness or not supposed to have guns.
MATTHEWS: Yes.
NELSON: So, how can you police all of that to make sure that they don`t? That`s a very difficult thing to do.
In the case of going and buying a gun, if we had the background checks that was mandated, mental illness having been a judge mentally ill --
MATTHEWS: Yes, it takes a judge.
NELSON: -- that is one of things that would not allow them to buy a gun.
MATTHEWS: Yes, but if a guy like this, we don`t know all the facts, but he wouldn`t checked in somewhere or someone reported his misbehavior, odd behavior, and he was identified by some physician for example, or agency official. But if he hadn`t been adjudicated by a judge as mentally deficient, he wouldn`t be on that list.
NELSON: And that makes it all the difficult. You take the Orlando shooting, Mateen, he had actually been on the terrorist watch list. He had gone off of it.
If you just had a law that says if a person purchases a gun that has been on the terrorist watch list, the FBI should be notified so they can double- check, should he go back on the terrorist watch list? If that had been the law, Mateen would have never gotten that high caliber rapid-fire weapon that he killed 59 people.
MATTHEWS: OK. Well, we got to keep trying.
Anyway, thank you so much. I respect you a lot. Senator Bill Nelson of Florida.
NELSON: Bless you.
MATTHEWS: We want to get back to the big political story the day, however, the one that`s going to matter weeks from now in terms of the president- elect. The intelligence report on Russia`s hacking in our election to help him win. Vladimir Putin ordering a campaign to influence that vote here because he had a clear preference for Mr. Donald Trump and he didn`t like Hillary Clinton. That`s ahead.
You`re watching HARDBALL.
MATTHEWS: Welcome back to HARDBALL.
As I mentioned, the declassified review of Russia`s involvement in 2016 election was released to the public today, and I`ve read the report. The report the intelligence community calls Russia`s meddling the boldest effort that the Kremlin has ever made, the Kremlin has ever made, to influence an election here. And it says the operation signals a new normal -- there`s a phrase -- in their efforts to target America and other countries around the world.
Well, late today, Donald Trump talked to ""The Associated Press"" about his briefing on the topic. He said he, quote, ""learned a lot"" but declined to say whether he accepts Russia`s role in election and I think he`s going to start to finesse that one.
I`m joined right now by our roundtable. Annie Linskey, national political reporter with ""The Boston Globe"", April Ryan is White House correspondent for American Urban Networks, and author of the book ""At Mama`s Knee"", and Perry Bacon is a senior political report with NBC News.
Perry, let`s go this way this time. Imagine -- I know you`re straight reporter, but I`m going to ask you to imagine -- supposed Hillary Clinton had gotten help from the Russkies from the old KGB man himself, the old commie himself, had gotten help of any kind in this election, what would the right-wing be saying?
PERRY BACON, NBC NEWS SENIOR POLITICAL REPORTER: They`ll be talking about it everyday. Donald Trump would tweet about it every hour, maybe trying to -- she`s now in office (INAUDIBLE) -- what a profound day to look at this though. We thought the into the Cold War happen right you know two decades ago, and now, we see on the front page the intelligence community defensively saying Vladimir Putin tried to change our elections and did succeed in picking his candidate over Hillary Clinton.
I mean, amazing finding. We knew the details of this already into this, but the report was so detailed in telling us exactly how it happened.
MATTHEWS: Yes, it was clear.
BACON: April, imagine that this was the flip side of this story and it was the Democrats or the more progressive elements in our society benefiting from alliance with the reds, with the communist. I mean, I just -- it`s -- maybe going -- in fact, imagine if Donald Trump had lost the Electoral College and won the popular vote by 3 million, what he`d be doing?
APRIL RYAN, AMERICAN URBAN RADIO NETWORKS: You know, they called her crooked Hillary during the campaign. This -- if this would have happened, she wouldn`t have even made it. Her ticket would not have made it to January 20th.
But there is a serious problem here and I`m going back to something President Obama said a couple of days ago. He said that if indeed this was during the Reagan era, Reagan would be turning over in his grave about this. This is terrible. You`ve got people like John McCain who is a Republican --
MATTHEWS: If it was in the Reagan era, he wouldn`t be in his grave.
RYAN: That`s true, that`s true.
But you know -- yes, but this would never happen during the Reagan era. So, we have totally turned the corner, turned the page in history and this is leading us down a path that could be counterproductive.
MATTHEWS: It`s going to big time.
RYAN: Yes.
MATTHEWS: Vladimir ain`t going to stop this kissy poo either.
ANNIE LINSKEY, THE BOSTON GLOBE: Right.
MATTHEWS: He loves this guy.
LINSKEY: Well, to your point, though, the Democrats did have it and an example of somebody who`s been perceived as close to the Russians and that was Bernie Sanders.
MATTHEWS: Yes.
LINSKEY: And you saw over and over --
MATTHEWS: How has he perceived this --
LINSKEY: Yes, as a socialist.
MATTHEWS: Yes, but the historic rivalry between the socialist and the communist.
LINSKEY: Sure. You get the idea of what the oppo would have looked like. I mean, it`s the counterfactual that you can see already people were saying, oh, Bernie Sanders, he --
(CROSSTALK)
MATTHEWS: OK, what is Trump going to do over all contrendre, how many days he`s just going to say, I`m not going to deny this anymore, he`s gonna try to change the subject? How -- when is he going to do it?
BACON: You get close to that today I would say. He -- if you look at his statement, he`s finally did not -- he stopped attacking the intelligence findings.
MATTHEWS: April, when he`s going to do his de-birther comment? Remember the de-birther --
(CROSSTALK)
RYAN: That`s exactly where I was going to go. If it took him years to do that, it`s going to take awhile for this.
MATTHEWS: We got to go right now to Governor Scott in Florida right now.
GOV. RICK SCOTT (R), FLORIDA: -- patients. I did. And I walked the hospital and thank them.
I talked to some patients and, you know, they`re in there in good spirits. They, you know, this is this is a traumatic experience for them, but they feel blessed that they`re in at this hospital.
REPORTER: Governor, you mentioned Pulse. This is your second, a recent mass shooting, debate about guns and all that stuff right now. What`s your mind at right now?
SCOTT: Well, you know, look, this is not the time to talk about politics. But I`ll tell you what we have to do. We have -- we have an ongoing investigation. We have to make sure we know exactly what happened. We have to hold people accountable.
We have to mourn for those who have lost their life. According to law enforcement, five people lost their lives. So, think about their -- those individuals and their families lives are changed forever. Also have to pray for all those that are still going through the surgeries or aren`t you know having life-saving things, surgeries done to help them.
REPORTER: I`m sure you`ve been talking to the FBI. Do we have a motive or anything yet?
SCOTT: I`ve been talking to law enforcement, FDLE, FBI, local sheriff`s department. I`ve been kept apprised all day. It`s an ongoing investigation.
You know, I tell you what, everybody is working well together. I saw that after Pulse. State, local and federal law enforcement worked together. We`re blessed in our state, we`re at a 45-year low in our crime rate.
But this investigation will take some time and, you know, I`m -- expectation all of us have is that as law enforcement puts out information, we`ll find out why this happened.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We`ll take one more question.
REPORTER: Governor, can you clarify the numbers, please, how many were seriously hurt?
SCOTT: According to law enforcement, five individuals lost their lives. Eight individuals were shot. That`s what I`ve been told by law enforcement but just remember there`s an ongoing investigation. They`re doing everything they can to take care of everybody. You know, other individuals ended up coming to our hospitals to make sure they were -- if they had injuries, that they were taken care of.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Governor, we have one more question here with NBC.
REPORTER: Can you tell us more about your conversations with the president and the president-elect?
SCOTT: Sure. The president called me probably now 30 minutes ago. He, of course, said his prayers were with everybody that was impacted, said that anything we need to make sure I gave him a call.
I talked to President-elect Trump and Vice President-elect Pence earlier this afternoon. They basically said the same thing, their prayers are with us, any resources they can help with. That was -- I was talking to them while the -- no one was exactly sure exactly what happened.
And so -- but they were -- appreciate that both President Obama and President-elect Trump called and Vice President-elect Pence called. And appreciate it when something like this happens, you know that you have the support of the federal government.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Thanks, everyone.
SCOTT: Thanks, everybody.
MATTHEWS: That`s Florida Governor Rick Scott with the latest on the shooting death. We`ll be right back after this.
This is HARDBALL.
MATTHEWS: We`re back with Andy, April and Perry.
Don`t those names sound great?
Anyway, Donald Trump is just two weeks from assuming the highest office in the world and the middle of his ongoing feud right now with the intelligence community. Well, today, he picked a fight on another front with the man who replaced him on ""The Apprentice,"" Mr. Arnold Schwarzenegger.
This morning, Trump tweeted as follows, ""Wow, the ratings are in and Arnold Schwarzenegger got swamped, or destroyed, by comparison to the ratings machine."" Anyway, Donald J. Trump, that was him, of course, ""so much for being a movie star. But who cares, he supported Kasich and Hillary.""
This means that Donald Trump, who has retained his executive producer title on that show, as well as a financial stake in ""The Apprentice"" show is now rooting against the success of his own show.
Schwarzenegger later returned the favor on Twitter saying -- this is really good -- ""I wish you the best of luck and I hope you`ll work for all the American people as aggressively as you worked for your ratings."" Good for Arnold.
BACON: Best two words in that? Who cares? Obviously Donald Trump.
MATTHEWS: Why would Trump trash his successor on the show he`s the executive producer.
Perry Bacon?
BACON: He told you, because his successor endorsed John Kasich and Hillary Clinton.
MATTHEWS: April, this is not even high school. It`s grade school.
RYAN: It`s low ball, that`s what it is. Let me say this --
MATTHEWS: Why would he do it? Is this one -- some people think all this is strategic. Wherever Trump faces a bad day coming -- and he knows today was the day that the CIA will say ""you`re full of it"", he says I`ll come up with another rabbit to put out for the press to follow. So, now, we`re talking about Schwarzenegger`s little tip or term.
Do you believe in the rabbit theory?
RYAN: Yes. For Donald Trump, yes, because he always is smoke and mirrors, when something there, I`m going to do something bigger to take your mind off and your eyes off of this.
But I also believe something, too, he can the executive producer of this and guess what? It`s a ratings push I believe as well.
MATTHEWS: You think it helps?
RYAN: I think it helps.
MATTHEWS: You buy all news is good for a show?
RYAN: I buy it, but I tell you what, check mate for Governor Schwarzenegger. Yes.
MATTHEWS: I thought he showed he`s gotten smarter than Trump on this one.
LINSKEY: I totally agree with you. I absolutely think it was a ratings play because now, like, even I want to watch the show.
MATTHEWS: You accept allies here.
RYAN: We`re in a tribe together, yes.
MATTHEWS: A lone person. Finish your thought.
LINSKEY: I even want to watch the show now. I mean, it`s like, oh, wow. That`s kind of interesting.
MATTHEWS: My EP here, Ann Clank (ph), has watched every single show for nine years.
Anyway, Annie Linskey, April Ryan, Perry Bacon, what mellifluous names.
That`s HARDBALL for now. Thank you for being with us.
""ALL IN"" starts right now.
THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED."
0	18	 19 von 72	MSNBC	January 6, 2017 Friday	 MTP DAILY	 5:00 PM EST	"HIGHLIGHT: Esteban Santiago, former National Guard, opened fire at Fort Lauderdale airport killing and critically hurting a number of people; The intelligence community put out report on Russian President Vladimir Putin`s clear preference on President-elect Donald Trump and ordered a campaign to undermine recent U.S. elections. A Fort Lauderdale airport shooting leaves people five dead and eight people injured. Hundreds of people on lockdown at the Fort Lauderdale Hollywood International Airport and police are scouring every inch to secure the entire premises, explains Debbie Wasserman Schultz. Florida Governor Scott live in a press conference, asking for prayers for victims fighting for their lives. Scott states that the investigation is ongoing and when the time is right, they will announce their findings. A witness describes the shooter, what he did at that time and his demeanor.

"	"CRAIG MELVIN, MSNBC ANCHOR: This is the tarmac of Florida Hollywood -- excuse me, Fort Lauderdale Hollywood International Airport. This has been the scene on that tarmac for some time now.
We`ve spoken to a number of people who are in that crowd, if you will, hundreds if not more than a thousand. Most of them are passengers, but you also see some airport personnel, some members of law enforcement, some emergency medical staffers as well on that tarmac.
Roughly three hours ago, a 26-year-old man walked in through the baggage claim area of terminal two and opened fire indiscriminately. And, at this point, we can tell you five people are dead, eight people injured. A number of folks on their way to the hospital, at the hospital, I should say, at this point. We`re waiting to get some sort of update on their condition.
Kerry Sanders is on sight at the airport again. We are waiting to hear from Florida Governor Rick Scott as well. There`s a news conference that`s supposed to take place any moment now where we expect get an update. 
And this is the first pictures we are getting of the suspect, Esteban Santiago is his name. We`re told that the 26-year-old was born in New Jersey. He hopped a flight from Anchorage, Alaska, to Minneapolis, St. Paul. And from there, he flew to Ft. Lauderdale Airport. He took a Delta flight from Anchorage to Minneapolis. And landed this morning.
Kerry Sanders standing by for us at the -- at the airport. Kerry, what`s the scene there right now?
KERRY SANDERS, MSNBC CORRESPONDENT: Well, Craig, the entire airport is in an lockdown situation. That means not only passengers who are now frozen in place, but also the whole perimeter of the airport is shut down. Nobody`s driving in or out unless they are law enforcement. And it`s going to be like that for several more hours we`re told.
Passengers who are in terminal two, which is right over here, many of them have made their way across the runway. All the way to the far side over there in a hanger. They`re separated, many of them, from their luggage.
As we come back here, I can sort of show you the scene. I`m going to walk you over here because there`s been so many moving parts and so many parts of the story that were believed to be and then turned out not to be the case.
This is terminal one up here. There were reports that there had been gunfire at terminal one and the authorities even responded as if there had been gunfire. That was incorrect. There was no gunfire there.
Passengers, nonetheless, panicked and made their way out and running.
Now, if I take you way over here, that`s down by terminal two. And if you look to the left there, you can see some cars parked on the parking garage deck there. The authorities had a report -- we believe it was a 911 call that there was some suspicious car. There`s something suspicious inside. The authorities responded there.
That turned out to be a false lead. But every single piece of this has to be followed so that the authorities can determine whether there is a threat or not.
All the luggages around the area that was abandoned is also now a concern. As we heard from Kate Snow just a short time ago, the explosive team -- explosives operation detonation team from the Broward sheriff`s office was going to.
And we are now told found a bag that seemed suspicious enough that they had to neutralize it. This is a common thing that they do. They take the bag to an area and then they detonate their own charge around it. We`re told that that happened.
There was nothing inside. That threat is now gone. We didn`t hear any explosions, but we`re told that that actually happened.
You can see that there is some ambulance -- or actually some -- there is a fire department lights down there. You see an ambulance making its way over there.
There have been some passengers who were not directly impacted by what happened down at baggage claim in terminal two.
But, nonetheless, the excitement of the moment, the rush of people going helter-skelter different directions caused them some anxiety and has brought about some additional medical problems. And so, they, right now, are being attended to and some of them are only now just calming down.
The Broward Hospital system has responded to the wounded and the injured who are now being transported or have already been transported.
And the death toll, as you know, stands at five. The suspect who is in custody, we don`t know whether he has since been moved. I know you got some shots of him. We`re not sure whether he`s been moved to another location, but the authorities have been questioning him.
And, at this point, even from my sources, I can`t determine whether there has any been suggestion of a motive. But, of course, that`s the question.
Greg is here. Greg, can you come over and talk to me for a second? You can`t. OK. Greg Meyer with the airport. Are you going to be having another news conference shortly?
GREG MEYER, SPOKESMAN, FORT LAUDERDALE HOLLYWOOD INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT: I believe -- I don`t know about shortly, but I figure we will be.
SANDERS: OK, thank you. That`s Greg Meyer with the Fort Lauderdale Airport here. He`s one of the spokesman for the operation of the airport. He just said that they may be having a press conference, but he didn`t say shortly. So, we may be getting some updated information from them.
And, of course, he would answer the question about the operations and what will happen to the passengers who are going to have to spend the night here. How they`re going to get their luggage. How they`re going to regroup. And how they`re going to rebuild this airport from ground zero. Full stop, back up.
Some of the people here, many of the ones I`ve talked to, they had just gotten off a cruise from the Caribbean. And so, they were in carefree spirits until they heard the gunshots -- Craig.
MELVIN: Kerry Sanders there in Fort Lauderdale. And, again, this isn`t just an assignment for Kerry. This is an area that he knows better than just about any correspondent. He has been reporting in and around the Miami area for the better part of 20, 25 years.
Kerry, stay with us, please. I`d like to come back to you in a bit.
Again, we are waiting on Florida Governor Rick Scott to hold a news conference, any moment now, to update us on this situation there.
On the phone right now though, Florida Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz. She represents the 23rd District. This airport inside the 23rd District.
Congresswoman, thanks so much for your time this evening. At this point, what more do we know about the circumstances surrounding what happened at that airport four hours ago? What more do you know, perhaps, about this suspect?
REP. DEBBIE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ (D), FLORIDA: Craig, thanks for having me and for doing such a good job covering this and keeping people informed.
The most important thing that people should know right now is that this is definitely still an active situation. Not in terms of a shooter because they`re -- it has been determined, from everyone that I have spoken to.
And I have spoken to the special agent in charge of TSA, the director of the airport, the sheriff, the chief information officer, Greg Meyer, who I speak with regularly.
And so, the rumors earlier about there being additional shootings were not accurate. The passengers on planes that have landed are sheltering on -- in place on the airplanes. We have passengers throughout the terminal and on the tarmac, as you`re showing, that are sheltering in place.
And law enforcement, as they should be, are meticulously securing each terminal to make sure that the airport is secure and that people are safe and that they tend to resume airport service and get people on their way. That`s the first priority as it should be.
MELVIN: So, that`s why we are seeing these images of all those folks on the tarmac. And we`ve heard from folks --
WASSERMAN SCHULTZ: Yes.
MELVIN: -- inside the terminal. These are folks who have been ordered to stay put until police can sweep clean.
WASSERMAN SCHULTZ: That`s right. The shooting only, as far as the information I have, took place in the terminal two baggage claim area.
But they are searching every single terminal, every floor, inch to inch, so that they can make sure that there is absolute certainty about the safety of the airport, keeping the airport personnel and the passengers, absolutely safe and that it`ll be safe to reopen the airport.
And then, I mean, as far as the motivations of the shooter, the -- any information about the shooter and even the victims whose next of kin have not even been notified, you know, we -- this is the first things first situation and safety is paramount.
MELVIN: And we should let folks know the image that they just saw there of all those folks on that tarmac, that was from a short time ago. That was taped. That was not live.
I do want to call your attention once again, these are our first pictures, first images of the shooter, of this 26-year-old who was reportedly, according to our sources, born in New Jersey. He hopped a flight last night from Anchorage, Alaska, layover in Minneapolis on to Fort Lauderdale.
And, again, at this point, according to eye witnesses who were just feet away from this man opening fire, they say that he said nothing as he shot indiscriminately inside that baggage claim area.
Congresswoman, at this point, according to folks that you`re talking to, is this a situation that they believe to be under control there at the airport?
WASSERMAN SCHULTZ: Well, you know, I am certainly not in a position to be able to say that the situation is under control.
Other than that, I am absolutely informed that there was only one shooter and that there were not additional shots fired outside the shots that resulted in the tragic deaths of the five individuals and the eight that were injured.
And that the other shootings reported earlier, subsequent to the initial shooting, was rumor and found to be inaccurate.
The -- nonetheless, the airport is closed and the terminals are being searched and meticulously secured.
[17:10:08] I will say, Craig, though, that, I mean, there will be a time and a place. And now is not that time to do the addressing, the, you know, how this happened.
But with each security situation that we have dealt with at airports -- and, obviously, we always balance in the United States the security of our traveling passengers with their ability to have the freedom to travel.
You know, the fact that this occurred in a baggage claim area which is not secured, and, you know, there`s no baggage claim area that`s secured in any airport, that I`m aware of, in the United States. And that, allegedly, this shooter checked firearms, went to the restroom, removed the firearm from his bag, and opened fire in an unsecure area, this is most definitely something that we are going to need to review.
Just like we reviewed after the shoe bomber used lighters to ignite his shoes on fire and we banned the use of -- we banned travel with cigarette lighters. Just like we banned liquids so many people are familiar that they can`t bring, other than a small amount of liquid on planes, because there was, you know, an individual who tried to make a bomb with liquids on an airplane.
This is a security situation that`s going to need to be reviewed. And I really think, and I will go back to Washington on Monday and speak to the leadership of the Homeland Security Department as well as TSA, that there`s definitely going to need to be a review of whether or not we should continue to allow firearms to be checked. And, certainly, you know, review the security of baggage claim areas (INAUDIBLE.)
MELVIN: Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz there. Congresswoman representing the 23rd District, Broward County of south Florida. This is her district. The airport sits inside that district.
Congresswoman, thank you. Please come back if there`s new information.
WASSERMAN SCHULTZ: Thank you so much. I surely will.
MELVIN: The scene right now, again, live look. This is the helicopter courtesy of our affiliate there in Miami, WTVJ. These are some of the airplanes that are stuck on that runway, if you will.
We just heard from the congresswoman, a few moments ago, telling us that a number of folks who had been ordered to shelter in place are on those planes. They are inside those terminals as well at the Fort Lauderdale Hollywood International Airport.
They are sheltering in place, while law enforcement continues to go floor by floor, the parking garages to continue to search every nook and cranny, if you will, of that sprawling airport.
This is one of the 25 -- I believe somewhere between 20 and 25th largest airports, in terms of size and in terms of traffic as well, in this country. This is not a small airport.
A lot of folks who are going Miami use this particular airport to fly into. And a lot of folks who are going on cruises as well, Fort Lauderdale a popular port for crews goers. It`s the 21st largest, in terms of traffic, I`ve been informed.
That`s the scene on the left side of your screen. On the right side of your screen, again, you see the microphones there. We are awaiting to hear from Florida Governor Rick Scott. Our expectation was this news conference was going to start roughly 30 minutes ago.
He is, undoubtedly, being briefed by a number of folks on the scene there. We`re told that when he finishes up, when he gets all of the information, he will step to those microphones there and pass that information on to us.
Jim Cavanaugh standing by. Jim Cavanaugh still with us, of course. Jim Cavanaugh, one of our law enforcement experts here at NBC.
And, Jim, let`s start with what we know, at this point. We know this was a 26-year-old man. We know that, according to our Justice Correspondent Pete Williams, he is also someone who had been dealing with -- we don`t know to what degree, but had been dealing with some mental health problems.
He had served in Iraq and he came back to this country. And, according to some either friends or family members, he had sought help for mental health problems.
At this point, according to our sources, it does not appear to be terror- related. But, Jim, it sounds like -- again, it`s early. But it sounds like this could very well be yet another case of someone who probably should have raised some red flags a few times in their past. But for whatever reason maybe did not or they just have been ignored. And now, we get this.
JIM CAVANAUGH, LAW ENFORCEMENT EXPERT, NBC NEWS: Yes, it has the feeling of a man choking on an empty grudge. It has a feeling of some spontaneity, given the totality of the facts we`re looking at, as you`ve just outlined, Craig.
It doesn`t give the feeling of a well-planned, you know, operation that any kind of terrorist organization would want to complete. And it just doesn`t give the feeling of a person whose well prepared with all kinds of weapons to come in there and do this attack.
[17:15:12] It has more of the spontaneous feel, and also because he got off the aircraft. And we know from the reporting from Pete and others that he had the gun in checked baggage and one handgun and maybe three magazines.
So, you know, going back, walking back this guy`s last few hours until what when he boarded in Alaska. That`s going to be the first part that`s critical to the investigators to determine what happened.
He`s likely told him his reasons. But they`ve got to walk that back through as well. They`ve got to do it for the state`s attorney because likely you`re going to have a --
MELVIN: Do you think he`s -- do you think he`s cooperating, Jim?
CAVANAUGH: Yes, my feeling is that he is. That he was blathering all over himself to the deputy once they got him in the radio car, and also probably on the way to the jail, once the detectives asked him what happened. Yes, I think he`s talking about it.
It`s such a homicidal rage to go through to shoot all these people. In such close range, point-blank in the head. I mean, that`s something in the psyche of a person. You know, he`s not going to be afraid to talk. I don`t that he`s any kind of a master criminal or Carlos the Jekyll terrorist.
He`s going to be telling them why he did it, Craig. We just don`t know. But I think they probably have a good handle on it. And, you know, we could boil down to some simple motives that we would say, well, that`s nothing. But, to him, it`s something.
And, you know, something that could have percolated like you described. Maybe reports earlier in his history of trouble. But why that group of people at that moment in time? That also will play something into it as well.
So, you attack a group for a certain reason. Even if there`s some mental issues, you still go after the group for certain reasons. That`s why we have workplace violence. That`s why we have terrorists pick specific targets to get the theater to dislodge government to influence politics. There`s always a reason.
MELVIN: Jim, let me go ahead and cut you off here. Florida Governor Rick Scott appears to be approaching the podium here just outside the airport. We are expecting him to make some comments, update us on the investigation, and take some questions as well.
Again, this is Florida Governor Rick Scott.
GOV. RICK SCOTT (R), FLORIDA: All right. The first thing I want to tell you is the citizens of Florida will not tolerate senseless acts of evil.
You just can`t imagine how this could ever happen in a state like ours. Think of the innocent lives that are lost. We still -- according to the sheriff`s department, we have five -- as you know, we have five individuals that lost their life. We still have people fighting for their life in our hospitals.
Whoever is responsible will be held accountable to the full extent of the law. So, let me repeat this. The state of Florida, the citizens of Florida, law enforcement in this state will not tolerate evil acts. Whoever`s responsible will be held accountable to the full extent of the law.
I have -- I heard about this when I was in Fort Myers. I immediately came over here. I got here about 1:45. I`ve stayed in contact with the sheriff`s office. Sheriff Israel has done an outstanding job.
But the FBI, everybody involved has done an outstanding job. There`s been complete coordination between FDLE, the sheriff`s department, the airport security, all federal agencies, everybody has worked together.
I reached out across the state, not only to our National Guard to make sure they were ready if there was any need for the National Guard. But also, airports and sheriffs across the state, where our major airports were, to make sure whatever resources they need, the state was available to provide those resources.
My heart goes out to every family impacted. The families that lost their loved ones, and the family and the individuals that have loved ones still in the hospital fighting for their life.
You can`t imagine how this could happen to any family, anywhere in the world. But, clearly, we don`t ever want this to happen in our great state.
I have reached out to President-elect Trump and spoken with -- to him and Vice President-elect Pence multiple times to keep them informed. And they told me whatever resources that we need from the federal government, they would do everything in their power to make that happen.
[17:20:04] My number one priority right here -- right now in Florida is to keep everybody safe. Everybody that lives in our state, everybody that travels to our state, do everything we can to keep them safe.
As you know, we have -- this is an ongoing investigation. There`s a lot of information that law enforcement will put out, at the time that they can put that out. And they`ll do that as quickly as they can.
But I can tell you, everybody is working hard to find out exactly what happened and to hold whoever did this accountable. I don`t ever want this to happen again to any family, anywhere in the world, but, clearly, never again in our great state.
I`ll be glad to answer any questions anybody has.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: How did you get here?
SCOTT: How did I get here?
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes, the airport is in lockdown.
SCOTT: I flew into the executive airport.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: And does the need to provide security for you detract from the need to provide security for the greater situation here?
SCOTT: I don`t believe so. I came here as quickly as I could. Stay informed, make sure that whatever resources the state need to provide. I made sure that the sheriff knew that, the airport knew that.
But on top of that, I did that for airports and sheriff departments across the state. On top of that, talking to our National Guard to make sure they were ready.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: What information do you have on the gunman?
SCOTT: We have a -- this is an ongoing investigation. All that information will be released through the sheriff`s department at the appropriate time.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Do you know if --
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Can you tell us the status of --
SCOTT: Say again, please.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Can you tell us the status of the injured and (INAUDIBLE.)
SCOTT: We don`t have details right now. But it will be -- that will be released at the appropriate time. Right now, the biggest thing to do is pray for them.
You know, we went through the pulse (ph). The biggest thing is, you know, pray for those -- all -- you know, the individuals that ended up in the hospital. Pray that every one of them survives.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Did you talk to President -- Obama?
SCOTT: I have not talked to President Obama.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Has he reached out you?
SCOTT: No, President Obama has not reached out to me. But I`ve talked to -- I`ve talked to vice president Pence and President-elect -- President- elect Trump and Vice President-elect Pence quite a few times just to keep them informed.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Did you reach out to Obama?
SCOTT: I have not.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Do you know if the gunman flew through Minneapolis or Anchorage?
SCOTT: Look, this is an ongoing investigation. The sheriff`s department will release information as quickly as they can.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Did President-elect Trump contact you or did you reach out to him?
SCOTT: I reached out to President-elect Trump and Vice President-elect Pence.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: But you didn`t call the president, you called the president-elect?
SCOTT: Absolutely.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Would it be appropriate to call the president for resources?
SCOTT: I have -- I have a personal relationship with Vice President Pence and President-elect Trump and I reached out.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Any other questions?
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Should there be a ban on weapons on airports now?
SCOTT: Look, this is -- it`s horrible what happened here. It`s not time to be political. It`s a time to mourn those that lost their life, finish the investigation and pray for everybody that is still fighting for their life.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: One more.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Do you think the state needs to do something as far as firearms are concerned? You mentioned this is now another incident that we have, a shooting on a large scale. Does something need to happen to obviously have (INAUDIBLE)? Do you think that something needs to happen both in both the state and nationally?
SCOTT: Let`s remember, this is a senseless act of evil. We are going to hold whoever did this accountable. It`s not time to do politics. It`s a time to -- remember, we have an active investigation, finish the investigation, mourn those that lost their life and pray for those who are still fighting for their life.
Thanks, everybody.
MELVIN: And there you have it. Florida Governor Rick Scott. We did not get a great deal of new information from the governor there. He did say that there were a number of folks who were in the hospital right now still fighting for their lives. He also asked for prayers for the victims as well.
One of the things that will certainly get some attention at least, and we heard a number of reporters ask the question, the follow-up question, is, well, it would seem as if the governor reached out to President-elect Donald Trump, Vice President-elect Mike Pence. Did not reach out to the White House.
He also said that he had not heard from President Obama, at this point.
Florida Governor Rick Scott there leaving the podium.
Meanwhile, while that was going on, we just got this in from the ""Associated Press."" According to the A.P., the brother of the suspect here, the brother of the 26-year-old, that man right there who is in police custody right now, his brother says that he received psychological treatment, some sort of psychological treatment in Alaska.
That brother also confirming when our Justice Correspondent Pete Williams told us earlier this afternoon, that he had spent some time in the Guard as well.
Pete also reporting that he had spent -- the 26-year-old Esteban Santiago had also spent some time serving in Iraq as well. He was a veteran.
Right now, he is in police custody. We`re told that he was not wounded.
[17:25:02] An eyewitness told me, a few hours ago, as he watched all of this go down, that it would seem, as if to him -- again, he was just a few feet away from Santiago. It would seem as if the only reason he stopped shooting was because he ran out of bullets.
And, at that point, he proceeded to walk a few feet. Dropped to the ground. Go spread eagle and wait for the police to come and handcuff him.
We do not know, at this point, whether he is cooperating with police. We probably won`t know that for some time. That is his picture on the right side of your screen.
Meanwhile, on the left side of your screen, that was the scene a short time ago. Hundreds of people, passengers, essentially sheltering in place, according to Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz.
There are folks there on the tarmac. There are still some folks inside the terminal. Folks who are also on airplanes right now, airplanes on the tarmac, who have been told that they are going to have to wait there until law enforcement manages to go through that airport, through the parking garages to make sure that this was, in fact, a lone gunman. And that there are also no booby traps or bombs.
Cal Perry has been looking into this suspect, into this 26-year-old. What do we know about him other than his name?
CAL PERRY, MSNBC CORRESPONDENT: Esteban Santiago, from New Jersey originally. He was, this morning, obviously in Alaska, traveled through Minneapolis on his way to Fort Lauderdale.
You`ve talked a little bit about his military service. He served in Iraq for just over a year. We`re getting that from some family members as we start to put together this profile of this mass shooter.
I want to continue to stress, and, Craig, you`ve covered a number of these as have I, it`s never one thing. It`s never just a veteran who may have had mental health issues. It`s never just somebody who was inspired.
It`s a combination of things. And that seems to be the picture that we`re starting to get here.
We`re also trying to determine whether or not -- and we have heard this from two law enforcement officials, talking to Pete Williams, that there may have been some kind of an incident, as you look at the flight path there. Some kind of an incident on that flight.
You had the dramatic interview with a witness in baggage claim who we believe was on this flight. Now, one of the reasons we haven`t been able to get back in touch with some of these witnesses is we understand that everybody on that flight is being held in place as they interview everyone individually.
MELVIN: Ah. There was a report earlier on our air, maybe an hour or so ago. We heard from a lawmaker who said that there was some sort of altercation on the flight. We have not been able to confirm that.
I would imagine that, of course, is going to be one of the things that they`re looking to find out during the course of these interviews with folks who were on the plane.
We also are getting in some more information on this gunman. This is coming from our team of producers and reporters right now. We can tell you this is according to a phone interview with the brother of the suspect.
According to Esteban Santiago`s brother, he was born in New Jersey. Moved to Puerto Rico. Grew up there. He served in the National Guard in Puerto Rico for six years. He was in Iraq for one year And two days. A year and two days in 2009 or 2010.
His brother says -- and the language I suppose is important here. His brother says, quote, ""He was pro-America."" He was a pro-America. This coming from his brother.
He moved to Alaska two years ago for work. According to his brother, he has -- the suspect has a female partner and a child. And he was working as a security guard.
His brother also tells our team here at NBC News that Esteban was, quote, ""fighting with a lot of people during his time in Alaska."" And he went on to clarify to say that he was having some relationship issues, arguing with his girlfriend and others.
The girlfriend -- again, this is coming from the brother, at this point. But according to the brother, he was receiving psychological counselling in Anchorage as well.
Again, all of this coming from Brian Santiago, brother of the man you see on your screen there, Esteban Santiago, who is, at this point, we`re told, in police custody. We do not know if he is cooperating.
Earlier this afternoon, I talked to a man named Mark Lee. Cal Perry just mentioned him. His name`s Mark Lee. He was a guy who saw all of this go down. He described in vivid, horrifying detail what happened.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
MARK LEE: He didn`t say anything. He was just -- he was quiet the whole time. He didn`t yell at people. He did nothing. He just started shooting. But he was about five seven. I`d say about 165, you know, from that point.
So, he just -- like I said, he just started randomly shooting people. He went up and down kind of the carousel to the baggage claim, shooting through luggage to get at people that were hiding. And just like I said, he had a 9 millimeter. He went through about three magazines is what I can tell and saw him on the ground after a watch back after because once he finished shooting he walked down by door 2, threw his gun on the ground, and laid spread eagle until the first officer came, which was probably about a minute later.
MELVIN: He fully expected to get caught -- fully expected to perhaps --
LEE: Oh, yes. Oh, yes. Oh, yes. He didn`t run off the building. He threw the gun down and laid spread eagle on the ground until the officer came up to him .
MELVIN: One gun .
LEE: . you know, single shooter, one gun, one shooter.
MELVIN: Folks running, folks getting down on the ground, the folks that were with you are they all OK?
LEE: Yes. Well, they`ll be -- The people -- like we just landed on that Delta flight that just came from Minneapolis. So like I said, my wife and I, we are fine. She ran out of the building. I started helping people get out, some older people that kept on tripping over each other as they were trying to get out. So I got a bunch of people out of the building. I actually ran back into the building and tried to get more people down or out or kind of safe from cover, you know, from that perspective.
And you know, certainly, like I said, after he kind of got other people down, he seems to run out of ammunition by that time. And you know, like I said, I was probably within 50 feet of him and I saw him basically, you know, had like kind of a blue polo shirt on there. He threw the gun down on the ground and laid down on the ground spread eagle and basically had one of the Broward County officer came up behind me with his gun drawn and came up behind him that are often -- basically until he got to him -- got it up to him, and you know, secured the scene and everything else.
MELVIN: Again, Mark Lee there who is still sheltered in place at the Florida -- excuse me -- the Fort Lauderdale Hollywood International Airport there in Broward County. Cal Perry also standing by for us here in the studio. I know that we got some more information on the shooter here.
CAL PERRY, MSNBC REPORTER: Just adding to what you had said in an interview with the producer, the brother said after Iraq and the question was, was he suffering from some mental health issues in relation to his service in Iraq? He said, ""Well, sometimes he`s good, sometimes he`s bad. He is significant other that he used to fight with a lot."" That`s something authorities are going to look into.
MELVIN: All right. Let`s turn now for a moment to the other big political headline of the day. We`ll have much, much more on this story in Florida in adjust moment. But NBC`s Political director, Chuck Todd, joining us right now. Chuck?
CHUCK TODD, NBC NEWS POLITICAL DIRECTOR, ""MEET THE PRESS DAILY"" SHOW HOST: Craig, I appreciate it. Obviously, it`s a lot of breaking news. You`ve been on this story, I`ve been and the world of Russia. I want to bring in a member of the Senate Democratic leadership, Senator Amy Klobuchar, after what`s been a big day on the Russian hacking front. So let me get you caught up on that story.
The intelligence community has just put out a public report after it briefed President-elect Trump privately that says, ""Russian President Vladimir Putin developed a, quote, ""clear preference for Donald Trump during the campaign."" The intelligence community assessment also says that Putin ordered a campaign to undermine our election and denigrate Hillary Clinton. We`ve heard from Trump today after he was briefed on all of this. The statement did not acknowledge any of those conclusions. In fact, just hours before his briefing, he told the ""New York Times"" that the issue was turning into a political witch hunt.
I spoke with Republican senators Lindsey Graham and John McCain today in and interview that will their full this Sunday on Meet the Press. Here`s what Senator Graham had to say about those witch hunt comments.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
LINDSEY GRAHAM, UNITED STATES OF AMERICA SENATOR: I think he is worried that inquiring into what Russia did in the election is going to undermine his credibility and his legitimacy. Quite frankly, I haven`t heard any Democrat at all of promise (ph) say that we doubt that Donald Trump won. Putin`s not the reason that Clinton lost and Trump won. I don`t think anybody`s saying that. So Mr. President-elect, that`s not what we`re trying to do. What we`re trying to do is find out what the Russians did in our elections and make sure that other people, including the Russians, won`t do it next time.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
TODD: Joining me now is Democratic Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota. She was part of a bipartisan delegation along with Senators McCain and Graham who traveled to the Baltic States at the end of the 2016 calendar year where they met with foreign leaders to discuss Russian aggression in cybersecurity. Senator Klobuchar, welcome here and under circumstances in fact obviously you`re a senator from Minnesota. This flight that this gunman down in Fort Lauderdale went through Minnesota. We don`t know about -- I know you`ve been concerned and trying to find out what`s going on.
AMY KLOBUCHAR, UNITED STATES SENATOR: Right. Well, we don`t know the details on the victims. We know that flight did come from Minneapolis, St. Paul. We`re a hub. And of course, our heart goes out to everyone in in Florida, all the victim`s families, and this just can`t be the new normal. And we`ve got to get to the bottom of what happened here. And we will certainly be looking to see if anyone from Minnesota was a victim.
TODD: Let me move to the Russia story today. First of all, you`ve seen the declassified briefing. Do you -- is there any doubt in your mind that Russia was a state sponsor here? Any doubt in your mind?
KLOBUCHAR: No. We have 17 intelligence agencies that have firmly said that this was going on in this declassified report. We have three prominent agencies that are saying, including the FBI and the CIA, and they`re basically saying here they had high confidence that this was directed by Vladimir Putin, this campaign to influence our elections.
TODD: Is there anything in here that`s made you question whether the election was free and fair?
KLOBUCHAR: Well, first of all, any influence from a foreign entity makes an election not fair. Whether it hurts the Democrats or Republicans, no matter what country it`s in. I don`t think we will ever really know the effect and how much influence it had on the outcome, but our goal here is to get out the information so that citizens of America understand what happened so this can`t happen again and that we allow other democracies to see this. There are upcoming elections in Germany and France. Senator Graham and Senator McCain and I were just in Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania. They all told us horror tales of how Russia had hacked into their own democracies and elections.
TODD: President-elect Donald Trump calls you up tomorrow and says, ""Why -- you know, this is -- you know, this is a distraction. We should move on."" What would you say to him based on what you`ve learned in this traveling to the Baltic States to say, ""Wait a minute, this is not about Hillary Clinton anymore.""
KLOBUCHAR: Well, I would first say I think one of his lines early on was we have to move on with our lives. Well, our lives are based on our constitutional freedom, our democracy, our freedoms to assemble, our freedoms to speak, our freedom of press, and that what we learned was in Estonia years ago, they had the audacity to move a bronze statue from a cemetery from a town square and so Russia then comes in and hacks in and cuts off their Internet access. In Lithuania, they extended an invitation to members of Ukraine Parliament that were in exile and came from Crimea, which Russia has illegally annexed. And sure enough, then Lithuania gets hacked into for just inviting them to an anniversary of their independence. This is happening. These countries have seen this movie before. They consider it an assault on democracy. That`s why we have the sanctions in place in addition to their illegal invasions.
TODD: What are they asking the United States to do?
KLOBUCHAR: A few things. They first to want see troops. They want to see U.S. troops and then continuing presence on the border and training their troops. I think that`s important. They want to continue trade with the U.S. so that they are -- we have friendships with these countries that have been brave enough to basically break off from Russia and have their own democracies. And then they want to make sure that we are standing up for them, not just in our rhetoric, but in our actions. Some of them want -- Ukraine would like to see some defensive weapons. Georgia would like to see us help them when Russia has illegally gone into 20 percent of their territory and they would like to join NATO.
TODD: Should that be the retaliation? Right there, what you just described. OK, Ukraine, you want this, here you go. Estonia, you want this, Lithuania -- should that that be the retaliation?
KLOBUCHAR: I think that should be part of our goal here, should be to protect these countries. And there`s a reason that they have record numbers of people that are volunteering for their military in places like Estonia, which is not exactly in the tips of America`s tongues. And I think helping them, making clear we stand by them, building up NATO, asking Europe to continue their support and expand their support of NATO, looking at defensive weapons if our military believes that helpful, I think all of those things should on the table.
TODD: All right. Let me ask you there will be -- this is sort of counter question of this, what -- why is this different? What Putin has now done -- why is this different than the United States fermenting democratic protests in Moscow?
KLOBUCHAR: Well, this is very different because what this is is a cyber attack on our country, on our democracy, where they basically have stolen information, right? They went into people`s computers. They weren`t just spying on them and Director Clapper made distinguished .
TODD: You think there is a distinguished espionage (ph) .
KLOBUCHAR: Yes.
TODD: . versus a .
(CROSSTALK)
KLOBUCHAR: . in the intelligence community, there is -- there`s spying goes on all the time. But in this case, they didn`t just buy, they took the information to disrupt and election. And that is a step beyond what we have seen before in America.
TODD: All right. Senator Amy Klobuchar, let us leave it there, Democrat from Minnesota.
KLOBUCHAR: Thank you.
TODD: Just came from Eastern Europe, I imagine this is going to be a story we keep talking about.
KLOBUCHAR: I hope so.
TODD: All right. Tune in Sunday to ""Meet the Press"" for my extended interview there with Senators John McCain and Lindsey Graham, two Republicans. They`re trying to convince Donald Trump to take this Russian aggression more seriously. Craig, let me give it back to you.
MELVIN: Yes. Certainly, it`s ""Meet the Press,"" we`ll be watching. Chuck, thank you.
Again, let`s bring folks up to speed on what`s happening right now. Again, this is Broward County, Florida. This is the scene at Fort Lauderdale Hollywood International Airport. Roughly four and a half hours ago now, it was just after 1 o`clock Eastern a man -- a 26-year-old -- according to police, a 26-year-old walked into Terminal 2 into the baggage claim area, there`s a picture of the suspect, bottom right of your screen. He walked in -- or may have already been in baggage claim. There`s still some uncertainty as to circumstances, but he opened fire.
Eyewitnesses say he was holding a 9-millimeter handgun, which he reloaded several time. He was shooting indiscriminately according to eyewitnesses there, only stopped because he ran out of bullets. At that the point, he gets down, he goes spread eagle according to eyewitnesses and waits on the police to come and arrest him. At this point, we`re told he is in police custody. We do not know whether he is cooperating with police, but we`ve heard from a number of people at this point that he is believed to have been a lone gunman. They do not believe that there are other gunmen at the airport right now. Nonetheless though, people are still sheltering in place.
We heard from Democratic Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman-Schultz a short time ago. She said there were still people in the terminal on the tarmac and actually still on airplanes as well while members of law enforcement work to make sure that the scene is clear. We saw some time ago these SWAT team members going floor to floor in a parking garage just to make sure that the scene is clear.
Hans Nichols is at the White House for us. And Hans, I know that you have been looking to the suspect`s military record. We heard from our justice correspondent, Pete Williams, a short time ago that he was a member of the guard and had done some -- has spent some time in Iraq. What more can you tell us?
HANS NICHOLS, NBC CORRESPONDENT: Well, he was in Iraq for less than a year. The deployment was for less than a year. He was in the National Guard, enlisted in Puerto Rico in 2007 and leaves in December 2011 -- 2007 -- excuse me -- he leaves about eight years later, you know. And here`s what we`re hearing in the White House, Craig. The president has been briefed by Lisa Monaco, received the briefing. He will be updated as a situation. They get more information here. That`s pretty standard.
And then from the president-elect side, from Donald Trump`s side as well, vice president-elect Mike Pence, they have both spoke within Rick Scott, the governor of Florida. He is providing them briefings here. In general -- and we`ve had too many of these to count to actually, you know, to take a moment to say there is a pattern, there is a standard here. They gathered all the information. Sometimes the president comes out and makes a statement. Don`t think we`re going to hear from the president on camera directly on this tonight, but he has been giving some interviews so there`s always a chance we`ll hear what the president has to say and the latest from him. Craig?
MELVIN: Hans, one of the things that struck a number of folks during the brief news conference from Florida governor, Rick Scott, here was that the governor said several times that he had spoken with the president-elect Donald Trump, the vice president-elect mike pence, but he had not spoken with President Obama. He had not reached out to the White House. The White House had not reached out to him. What more do we know about that, and if that`s the case, do we know why?
NICHOLS: Well, we don`t know why. And I wouldn`t read too much into this. This is a fluid situation. They`re still trying to gather all the facts in. In general, the president`s top aids give him briefings. They`re in touch with law enforcement officials at the state, federal, and local level. Whether or not there`s a governor to presidential conversation tonight, I wouldn`t read in to much to that. In the past, yes, there have been conversations, but we do know that Rick Scott has relationships with Mr. Trump and Mr. Mike pence, perhaps it was having the contact numbers ready and giving them the briefings because he knows that the president himself receives briefings from, in this case, Lisa Monaco, the homeland security advisor. Craig?
MELVIN: Hans Nichols from 1600 Pennsylvania on this Friday evening. Hans, thank you, sir. Again, at this point, what we know that five people are dead as a result of the shooting. At least eight people are hurt. Florida Governor Rick Scott saying that there are also a number of people in the hospital who are in critical condition. Earlier, I talked to an eyewitness to the shooting. His name was John Schlisher (ph). He was standing just a few feet away from the gunman, and he told me that he is very, very lucky to be alive.
(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)
JOHN SCHLISHER (ph), FORT LAUDERDALE AIRPORT SHOOTING WITNESS: We were standing at baggage. So, we`re waiting for our luggage to come up. The first 10 or so bags came up when I heard the first shot. I wasn`t sure what it was at first, but I saw the person right to my side fall to the ground, and I turned and looked, and the shooter was in the center hallway, just outside of -- just next of baggage carousel number two and number one, right between there and he was holding the black handgun and shooting randomly into the crowd and he was shooting people in the head. There were elderly people that were shot and killed. There were two people to my left and two people to my right that were shot and several of them died.
MELVIN: John, as you watch this unfold, could you make out whether this man was saying anything while he opened fire?
SCHLISHER (ph): When I looked over, he said nothing. He said nothing. He was just shooting. And when I -- as I said, I had just pulled the first piece of luggage off the carousel when I heard the first shot. And as I turned and saw him standing, there was -- the hallway, and he didn`t say anything. He just was firing. He did have time to reload his gun before he started firing a second time.
MELVIN: Did he appear to be acting alone. Was he by himself?
SCHLISHER (ph): As far as I could see, yes. He was by himself.

MELVIN: And our sources have confirmed that. They do believe that he was in fact acting alone, 26 years old. Sources also are close to the investigation telling us that Esteban Santiago flew from Anchorage, Alaska, hopped a flight to Minneapolis, St. Paul, and then on to Fort Lauderdale airport. It was a Delta flight that he took, both legs of delta flight. At this point, again, he is in police custody. Cal Perry again working with our investigative unit here. What more do we know about this suspect?
PERRY: He was born in New Jersey. He moved to Puerto Rico as a toddler. That`s where he grew up. Their mother still lives there. He served in the National Guard in Puerto Rico for six years before he went to Iraq in 2009. He was there for one year and two days. He then moved to Alaska about two years ago. He worked as a security guard. He has a significant other and we`re starting to have a picture painted of a very difficult relationship, a relationship that was fraught with fighting. This is from one of his family members, quote, ""He would fight with a lot of people during his time in Alaska.""
He clarified his brother then said he clarified it to say he has relationship issues and issues arguing with other people and that he was, quote, ""receiving psychological counseling in Anchorage."" He did have a handgun and his brother said that in Alaska guns are legal and so he had a handgun. His guard service reads like this. He joined the National Guard December 14, 2007. He was deployed to Iraq on April 23rd of 2010. Like I said, he was there for one year and two days. Before that, he was in the Reserves. And he received a general discharge. He did not leave on any kind of bad terms.
As we continue to try to -- and our investigative unit specifically tries to probe any kind of motive and I want to be clear we still don`t have a motive. But one of the things that keep coming up in interviews with relatives is the idea that he came back from Iraq a different person than he left. From his aunts, this is what she said and this is a quote, ""When he came back Iraq, he was not feeling good. They put these kids in war, and when they come back, they don`t do anything for them."" So certainly his aunt telling our investigative team that she worried about his psychological health when he returned from Iraq.
MELVIN: The headline being, according to his brother, he was receiving psychological counseling in Alaska. We are going to take a very quick break here. When we come back, we will continue our coverage of this situation there in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Stay with us. This is MSNBC.
MELVIN: And a live look here, the left side of your screen, this is -- this has started to happen in the last few minutes. This is the -- this is the scene outside of the hospital -- a major hospital there in Broward County. Again, we heard from Florida Governor Rick Scott roughly 30 minutes ago telling us that there were number of people inside of the hospital, in his words, fighting for their lives. We may -- we may be getting an update from the hospital any moment. We are keeping a close eye on the left side of the screen when that happens. Let`s go to Vice President-elect Mike Pence.
MIKE PENCE, VICE PRESIDENT-ELECT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: . to their families, to the courageous first responders and to all of the citizens of the Fort Lauderdale area. It`s very challenge time and we just hung up from our latest conversation with Governor Scott. He has briefed the president-elect and myself several times this afternoon we are grateful for his leadership and again that of all the first responders in the Fort Lauderdale and in Florida, a heartbreaking loss of live. And as I said, the hearts of -- the hearts of every American are in Fort Lauderdale tonight.
We did this afternoon complete an extensive briefing from the leaders of our intelligence community. It was as president-elect said it was constructive and respectful dialogue. And the president-elect has made it clear that we`re going to take aggressive action in the early days of our new administration to combat cyber attacks and protect the security of the American people from this type of intrusion the future, but I know the president-elect appreciated the presentation made by the leaders of our intelligence community and I know the president-elect and I both appreciate the sacrifices that the men and women who serve in our intelligence services around the country and around the world provide in contributing to the safety and security of the American people. Thank you all very much.
(CROSSTALK)
MELVIN: All right. There you have Vice President-elect Mike Pence on the right side of your screen outside of Trump Tower also talking about the situation there in Fort Lauderdale and also talking about the intelligence briefing that he and the president-elect received a few hours ago, promising swift action to try and combat cyber terrorism, did not name Russia, did not name China on a threat manner.
This is Broward Medical Center. This is a news conference happening outside the hospital where a number of the victims have been taken. Let`s listen into this.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The trauma patients, I`m not so sure we`re talking about the injuries because, you know, things like keeper (ph) and stuff like that. So, that will be left to the other press releases when they do that.
(CROSSTALK)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: . for this type of mass casualty? What was it like for guys to actually have .
(CROSSTALK)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Well, actually, if you just took a video of it, it would look like chaos but it`s controlled. It was actually -- this whole system worked very well today. I was proud of everybody who was there. We trained for this and (inaudible) and I think that as a level one trauma center, Broward General showed -- shined very well today.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Is this the only -- where there also the (inaudible) of a mass casualty situation like this?
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Well, the last one that I remember being involved in was Haiti earthquake, that`s what I remember offhand.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Can you tell us about (inaudible)?
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: No. I think I should leave that for the press people.
(CROSSTALK)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: No. Only two on the winter (ph).
(CROSSTALK)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We don`t have to have basis on that investigation. So, we should be close enough to give any more information. So, thank you very much and we`re .
(CROSSTALK)
MELVIN: All right. There you have what appears to have been a hastily called news conference outside of Broward General there. We did not get a great deal of information. Again, that`s not uncommon in situations like this. There are, of course, privacy concerns that have to be protected. We were also told a short time ago a number of immediate family members have to be contacted as well. So, we will be keeping an eye on that situation at hospital.
This is the scene outside the airport as well. You can still see a very heavy law enforcement presence and that is expected to be the case for some time. We also just learned a short time ago, courtesy of the Associated Press, that the suspect here received what`s called a general discharge from the Alaska Army National Guard last year for unsatisfactory performance. The lieutenant colonel did not -- Lieutenant Crow (ph)did not -- Lieutenant Crow (ph) who gave this information -- gave the Associated Press this information did not release a great deal of information about the details surrounding this discharge but did say that the suspect, Esteban Santiago, joined the Guard in November of 2014 and he also spent a year -- spent a year in Iraq. He was deployed to Iraq in 2010, spent a year there with 130th Engineer Battalion and also spent some time with the 1013 Engineer Company out of Aguadilla as well. Jim Cavanaugh, we only have about 60 seconds, but you said something earlier that I wanted to come back to. You said that you thought that the suspect was likely cooperating with police right now. What makes think that?
JIM CAVANAUGH, MSNBC LAW ENFORCEMENT ANALYST: Well, it`s just when you go into that kind of a homicidal rage, you know, arrested killers right after they did the act and they`re just spent, you know. They just sometimes turn to you, a guy like this to be surrendered so easily and hand you the gun and say, ""I did it."" So, it doesn`t seem to me like a well-planned attack. It seems more of a spontaneous event. We may be dealing with some mental illness, but I believe, I can`t be sure, it`s just a speculation and some experience that, you know, he might have flattered (ph) his whole reason, even though that`s an incomprehensible reason none of us can understand. But to the deputies, when they arrested him and to the detectives, when he interviewed him, he might tell them I was mad because of this or I was sick because of that or I thought these people was going to hurt me or whatever his reason, but I believe they will get it out of him. They`re good detectives there at Broward. So, I think we`ll probably have some progress on that already.
MELVIN: All right. Jim Cavanaugh, Jim, thank you as always for your insight and perspective. Again, we should let folks what they`re looking at here in progress as well. I`ll do my best to describe the scene. This appears to be some sort of airport hangar at Fort Lauderdale Hollywood International Airport. We were told at the top of the hour by Florida Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz, who represents the district in which this airport is located, that people are still being told to shelter in place and they are sheltering in place inside this airport hangar. We`ve seen a number of folks still on the tarmac there.

SEAN HANNITY, FOX NEWS HOST (voice-over): Tonight, America's top intelligence official testifies that Russian hacking did not influence the election.
JAMES CLAPPER, DIRECTOR OF NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE: They did not change any vote tallies or anything of that sort.
HANNITY: Laura Ingraham is here with reaction.
DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENT-ELECT: We're getting rid of ""Obama care."" It is a total disaster! 
HANNITY: Then, congressional Republicans are moving quickly to finally repeal and replace ""Obama care"" while Democrats dust off their tired old fear tactics.
SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY), MINORITY LEADER: Make America sick again.
HANNITY: Austan Goolsbee, Ari Fleischer, Michael Cohen all weigh in.
JULIAN ASSANGE, WIKILEAKS: (INAUDIBLE) about power.
HANNITY: And more of our exclusive interview, with WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.
All of that, plus Senator Ted Cruz and Michelle Malkin are all here tonight.
""Hannity"" starts right here, right now.
(END VIDEOTAPE)
HANNITY: And welcome to ""Hannity."" So America's top intelligence official goes to Capitol Hill and testifies that Russian hacking did not influence the election, which, by the way, completely shatters the Democrats and their latest attempt to try and undermine President-elect Donald Trump.
Now, this is information I'm about to give you, I promise you, you will not hear in the corrupt liberal media. By the way, I hope Senator John McCain and Senator Lindsey Graham -- I hope they're paying very close attention tonight because that's tonight's ""Opening Monologue.""
The director of national intelligence, James Clapper -- he appeared before the Senate Armed Services Committee earlier today and was asked about a major post-election Democratic talking point, the claim that Russian hacking handed the election to Donald Trump. And here's what Clapper said.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
JAMES CLAPPER, DIRECTOR OF NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE: They did not change any vote tallies or anything of that sort.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes, I'm just...
CLAPPER: And we had no way of gauging the impact that -- certainly, the intelligence community can't gauge the impact that it had on the choices that the electors made. There's no way for us to gauge that. Whether or not that constitutes an act of war, I think is a very heavy policy call that I don't believe the intelligence community should make. But it's certainly -- would carry, in my view, great gravity.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
HANNITY: All right, let me explain what this means. Everything that you have been hearing from the president, from Hillary Clinton, from her campaign, from the Democratic Party about hacking determining the outcome of this election is not true.
Now, here's what is true. Now, did the Russians hack into our voting machines? No, they did not. Did WikiLeaks, though -- did they reveal how corrupt the liberal news media is and that how they colluded with the Clinton campaign? Yes, that's true. Did WikiLeaks reveal how some DNC staffers made anti-Semitic, misogynistic, racist, homophobic, sexist comments? Yes, that was revealed. Did WikiLeaks reveal that the DNC tried to discredit Bernie Sanders and rig the primary for Hillary Clinton? Yes, that's true. That was revealed, too.
So this isn't about Julian Assange, this is all just another excuse by the Democrats as to why Hillary Clinton lost the election and an attempt to delegitimize Donald Trump's presidency and his victory.
Now, we do know that when Assange was 16 years old, he hacked into NASA. He hacked into the Department of Defense! We have known about WikiLeaks now for 10 years. Now, this group has been publishing classified government information that clearly shows that this country, the United States America, has major cyber security problems.
Now, tonight, we're going to play more of our exclusive interview with Julian Assange where he's going to explain why he what he does. Here's a quick previews.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
JULIAN ASSANGE, WIKILEAKS FOUNDER: Why are we interested in publishing information? (INAUDIBLE) because people can do things with power. They can do very bad things with power. If they're incompetent, they can do dangerous things.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
HANNITY: Now, we're going to play the rest of that exchange later tonight, but first, I have said this for years. Cybersecurity needs to be beefed up very quickly. Why? We can't have Russia, North Korea, China, Iran, other foreign adversaries hacking into our government systems!
So what has the Obama administration done in the past eight years to stop this? Well, let's take a look at all the government agencies. Now, most of you do not know this. It's not being reported by the media. But let's look at the government agencies that have been hacked into since President Obama took office.
Now, since 2009, look at this. Hackers have attacked the U.S. electrical grid. They've attacked the Pentagon's Joint Strike Fighter project. They have attacked NASA. They've attacked the Department of Energy, the Federal Election Commission networks, even the U.S. Postal Service, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. That's been hacked.
Look at this. The White House has been hacked since Obama's been president! The State Department has been hacked. The Department of Defense has been hacked. The IRS has been hacked, and at the Office of Personnel Management -- all have been hacked.
Now, President Obama -- by the way, and John McCain and Lindsey Graham and the Democrats -- if they were all serious about hacking, then would they have not done something about this while all of this has been happening? Did you even hear about this before?
Now, let's take, for example, China. They hacked the Office of Personal Management. This was 2015. They got sensitive information on over 21 million people in America, and that information means those people's information was compromised. And then the CIA -- at the time, they thought the breach was so serious that they removed agency officers that were stationed in China as a precautionary measure.
But the president never spoke about it publicly, not one time. No diplomats were removed, no sanctions. Now, we also had Edward Snowden. He was leaking all kinds of classified government information, not to mention the major revelations over the years from WikiLeaks.
Look at all this sensitive information that was exposed by WikiLeaks in years earlier, years prior. By the way, have Democrats, John McCain, Lindsey Graham -- in all this time, have they done anything? We'll put it back up on the screen. Have they done anything to stop stuff like this that we put on the screen from happening? No, they haven't done anything.
So let me put this all into perspective. There's a big difference between a political party being hacked and sensitive U.S. government information that is being stolen that exposes secrets and potentially is putting American lives at risk. Now, the only thing the DNC and the Podesta leaks exposed was the truth about the Democrats being corrupt. It confirmed everything that many of us already suspected!
So here's my message to the sore loser left. You can complain all you want about this, but the fact is, this has been going on for eight years and even before that. And President Obama, John McCain, Lindsey Graham did nothing about it. So if Hillary Clinton and the Democrats want to complain, want to blame people, maybe they should blame Barack Obama.
Now, I don't think the Democrats are being sincere. I think what they're trying to do is score cheap political points. For example, listen to what Democratic senator Claire McCaskill said at today's hearing. Take a look.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
SEN. CLAIRE MCCASKILL (D), MISSOURI: The notion that the elected -- the soon elected leader of this country would put Julian Assange on a pedestal compared to the men and women of the intelligence community and the military that is so deeply embedded in the intelligence community -- I think it should bring about a hue and cry. No whether you're Republican or a Democrat, there should be howls. And mark my words, if the roles were reversed, there would be howls from the Republican side of the aisle.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
HANNITY: Now, of course, President-elect Trump saw this new takedown attempt coming, and before the hearing, he tweeted, quote, ""The dishonest media likes saying that I'm in agreement with Julian Assange. Wrong. I simply state what he states. It is for the people to make up their own minds as to the truth. The media lies to make it look like I'm against intelligence, when in fact, I am a big fan.""
Now, as the president-elect's own team said, well, Mr. Trump has every right to be skeptical about what's been coming out about the election hacking, and today's hearing proves that Donald Trump was right to push back against the left's untrue claims.
Now, also tonight, just to remind you viewers of what WikiLeaks did, in fact, reveal during the 2016 election, we're going to put up on the screen again, full screens, on the side of your screen so you can be reminded of what we did learn from WikiLeaks as this eight-year period of doing nothing to stop cyber attacks was going on.
Here with reaction, editor-in-chief of Lifezette, FOX News contributor, nationally syndicated talk show host Laura Ingraham. Laura, the amazing thing about this -- we've known about this! Every government agency has been hacked! Not a peep out of Obama, nothing done to fix the problem. John McCain being all sanctimonious, Lindsey Graham all sanctimonious -- and I'm thinking, You guys have been there all this time. You've known about every agency being hacked. Why didn't they do anything then?
LAURA INGRAHAM, FOX CONTRIBUTOR: Well, I think it was a very inconvenient truth, Sean, that you aptly pointed out in your monologue, that for the last eight years plus, the United States has been exceedingly vulnerable to cyber attacks from a variety of sources, some state-sponsored, some not. Some are attacks by, you know, one-off hackers, you know, having a joyride through the internet.
But the bottom line is both Democrats and Republicans do agree that we need an entire revamp, and Trump is going to do this, I believe -- an entire revamp to our approach to cyber security. And that really was -- as many senators tried to point out today, that was supposed to be the focus of the hearings today.
The Russia, you know, deal took up a lot of it, but the focus is supposed to be what are we going to do about the future of our cybersecurity efforts? What has been done thus far, and what can we do to stop it? And I think as far as I heard from a lot of the witness testimony, the government testimony, they're still trying to play catchup on a lot of this stuff. That's the biggest scandal here, when, as you pointed out, China took 20 million personnel files, including mine. I got a note from...
HANNITY: By the way, I want a copy -- if the Chinese are watching tonight, I'd like a copy of Laura's files, please.
INGRAHAM: Oh, good!
(LAUGHTER)
INGRAHAM: All my -- all my personal information!
HANNITY: Are all your big secrets in there?
INGRAHAM: It's so exciting. But you know, they -- so they have all this on everybody. And some liberals are pointing out, Well, China didn't use this information. And I think we can answer, Well, how do we know? I mean, it could be used as in the future. Might be being held in abeyance for a future -- so you're right, they didn't take any of this seriously when it was happening from other state sponsors, and it was -- it was basically admitted today that there's no sense that this affected the outcome of the election.
Was Russia perhaps involved through, you know, layers of other hacking helpers? You know, apparently, the report was delivered to the president today. More specifics were in that. A declassified version will be released to the public. And Donald Trump will get his report tomorrow. He'll get his briefing tomorrow.
HANNITY: All right, let me ask you this. Let's compare because I'll just give -- I'll just give WikiLeaks leaks up to 2012. So they had all these years to fix this. For example, the operating procedures for Camp Delta, for Gitmo. They released the classified video of a series of attacks in Baghdad. Remember two reporters for Reuters were killed. The Afghanistan war logs were released. The Iraqi war logs were released. Diplomatic cables were released. The WikiLeaks released the Gitmo files. They released the Syria files.
And then four years later, the DNC files. Nobody cared about that. Why do they care about the DNC, which is not even a government agency?
INGRAHAM: Well, obviously, the broader effort here is to cast aspersions on the legitimacy of Trump's electoral victory. And this will be done both through this story, as long as they can keep it alive, and through other means and I think efforts by the left over the next four years. This is not going to stop with this story. And I don't have any view about whether the Russians were involved. I -- I -- who knows? I mean, the intelligence agencies say unequivocally...
HANNITY: I don't know, either.
INGRAHAM: ... that they think it -- think it was.
HANNITY: But why don't they show us the evidence? Congress has been requesting the evidence. They won't even go to the hearing with it. Julian Assange is adamant saying no.
INGRAHAM: Right. And The Hill today reported very different from The New York Times. The Hill reported that they were very light on any evidence backing up their claim...
HANNITY: Right!
INGRAHAM: ... that Russia -- well, what the DNI is saying, Sean, is that, Well, be have to be very careful about releasing methods and sources. We're going to declassify as much as we can, but we have to be careful because of the sensitive nature of all this.
HANNITY: Well, where was this urgency when NASA was hacked, the White House was hacked...
INGRAHAM: Right.
HANNITY: ... the State Department was hacked...
INGRAHAM: Well, that was all embarrassing...
HANNITY: ... the Department of Defense was hacked?
INGRAHAM: Sean, you nailed it, though. That was embarrassing to the Democrats. Now they think is embarrassing to Trump, or -- embarrassing to his victory or again, you know...
HANNITY: So this is political.
INGRAHAM: ... slighting his victory.
HANNITY: This is all political.
INGRAHAM: Oh, I think -- I think...
HANNITY: It's not about -- shouldn't they have fixed cybersecurity eight years ago, ten years ago?
INGRAHAM: I -- well, I think the -- the -- even the way that Hillary went about, of course, storing her e-mails -- I mean, there -- if this was so important that people not use private e-mails, e-mail servers, then why didn't they move to seize that computer early on of Hillary's?
HANNITY: Yes.
HANNITY: I mean -- I mean, if this was really a serious issue, they could've done a lot more in the beginning of that investigation. But again, it was inconvenient for the Democrats. I have no doubt that we have other countries who are adversaries who want to muck around in our system.
HANNITY: North Korea, Iran, China...
INGRAHAM: No doubt.
INGRAHAM: ... and even Russia. I believe all that's true.
INGRAHAM: No doubt.
HANNITY: By the way, I'm willing to pay the Chinese huge amounts of money to get your file.
INGRAHAM: OK. It's probably pretty boring. But it does have my, you know, phone numbers, old places of...
HANNITY: Wow.
INGRAHAM: ... of residence, you know, all that stuff you could use to get I guess passwords, and I don't know, just dig up old, like, pranks I did in college or something. I don't know.
HANNITY: Well, that became a big issue, if you run for president, you're going to be Mitt Romney (INAUDIBLE) whatever is there, so...
INGRAHAM: Good point.
HANNITY: All right.
INGRAHAM: Good point.
HANNITY: Laura, good to see you. Thank you.
INGRAHAM: Good to be with you.
HANNITY: Happy new year, by the way.
INGRAHAM: Happy year.
HANNITY: And up next tonight right here on ""Hannity""...
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
TRUMP: We will repeal the disaster known as ""Obama care"" and create new health care, all sorts of reforms that work for you and your family.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
HANNITY: So President-elect Donald Trump has vowed to repeal and replace ""Obama care."" How exactly is he going to do that? Well, he's calling out Senator Chuck Schumer for standing in the way. Up next, we'll get reaction from Ari Fleischer, Austan Goolsbee and Michael Cohen.
And also later tonight, Senator Ted Cruz and Michelle Malkin -- they'll be with us and much, much more straight ahead.
(NEWSBREAK)
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
TRUMP: We will repeal the disaster known as ""Obama care"" and create new health care, all sorts of reforms that work for you and your family.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
HANNITY: All right, that was President-elect Trump on his thank-you tour promising to repeal and replace ""Obama care."" Now, this morning, Donald Trump tweeted, ""The Democrats lead by head clown Chuck Schumer know how bad ""Obama care"" is, and what a mess they are in. Instead of working to fix it, they do the typical political thing and blame. The fact is, `Obama care' was a lie from the beginning -- keep your doctor, keep your plan. It's time for Republicans and Democrats to get together and come up with a health care plan that really works, much less expensive and far better.""
And it's a good thing, by the way, that he is not backing down because the numbers are grim. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, the increase in health care costs for employer-sponsored benefits since 2008, Obama's elected, is now $5,462. That is a 43 percent increase.
And as we told you last night, this year, ""Obama care"" premiums are increasing by 25 percent on average. Premiums on average for a family of four making $60,000 a year -- well, that's going to spike by 43.6 percent. And by the way, deductibles for the same group, they're skyrocketing by 22.9 percent. By the way, if you live in Arizona, it's a 116 percent increase this year alone.
Here with reaction, former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer, former Obama economic adviser Austan Goolsbee, and from the Trump organization, Michael Cohen is with us.
Ari, this was a promise Republicans made. If you are paying over $5,500 more a year, and this year along, you're going to see increases on average of 30 percent or higher, how do you justify that based on the plan that was supposed to keep your doctor, keep your plan and save $2,500 per family per year?
ARI FLEISCHER, FMR. WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: Yes, this is a really, Sean, ultimate example of government largesse and government failure. It's an example of how you can spend trillions of dollars in subsidized something, so at least somebody gets some level of insurance that they didn't have before.
But it's just not worth it to society. It's not worth it to those who had their premiums hiked so they could pay more, to people who such high deductibles their insurance is worthless to begin with.
It's vital Republicans act on what they said they would do and repeal it. They have to do it. They also have to replace it, and Sean, I would Republicans need to replace it in 2017. The worst thing for Republicans will be if they repeal it and then years go by before they replace...
HANNITY: Well, Paul Ryan said this year.
FLEISCHER: Republicans promised both, they need to deliver both.
HANNITY: And they have nine different individual plans with some similarities, health savings accounts. Donald Trump talked at length to me about it. That increases competition, affordability. It also includes bringing it job to job, buying across state lines.
You know, Austan, you are pretty honest guy, but you always spin. Obama said...
(CROSSTALK)
AUSTAN GOOLSBEE, FMR. OBAMA ECONOMIC ADVISER: ... no spin.
HANNITY: Hang on. Keep your doctor, keep your plan, save on average $2,500 a year. Now, why do I know you so well that you're going to say Well, even though it went up $5,400 or $5,500 a family, it still is a savings. Why do I expect that to come out of that liberal wonderful mouth of yours?
GOOLSBEE: OK, it will -- it will, but first, for anybody that went to MIT, the MIT alumni magazine -- they had an article in which, Sean, you're quoted saying very nice things about me. Your viewers are going to be very upset when they read...
(LAUGHTER)
HANNITY: I love you personally! I really do!
(CROSSTALK)
HANNITY: You're just wrong, but I love you.
GOOLSBEE: But I will say this. Sean, what did not observe in the numbers that you quoted -- and unfortunately, for Donald Trump, he's going to have to deal with the same problem Obama's dealt with, is those prices that are up 40 percent in the last eight years -- you failed to mention that that's the slowest rate of increase of health care prices in the last half- century.
HANNITY: OK, but millions...
(CROSSTALK)
HANNITY: Millions lost their plan...
GOOLSBEE: But now Donald Trump is about to own everything everyone hates about the health system.
HANNITY: All right, that's the Democratic talking point.
GOOLSBEE: Because he's going to make a change!
(CROSSTALK)
HANNITY: Well, Michael...
MICHAEL COHEN, TRUMP ORGANIZATION: I don't even know where this man is coming from. In all honesty, at the end of the day, there's, what, 18 million people joined ""Obama care""? Of course, after spending $1.8 or $2 trillion...
(CROSSTALK)
HANNITY: ... keep redoing it.
COHEN: Right, and to some Canadian company as opposed to using our tech geniuses in this country. Let me tell you the difference, Sean. Donald Trump is a -- a -- he's gentleman who knows how to get things done. It's going to be like Trump rink, where he went ahead and...
HANNITY: This is the Wollman rink in Central Park.
COHEN: That's correct -- where he went ahead and it was a failing item for a long time. He came in. He fixed it. He knows what to do.
HANNITY: Wait a minute. (INAUDIBLE) under budget...
COHEN: Ahead of schedule...
HANNITY: Ahead of schedule.
COHEN: And it's an absolute success. And he's going to do the same sort of things for this country exactly the way he did for his Trump Organization.
HANNITY: Well, let me -- Ari, I've always like competition. In other words, if you have the ability, if you live New York, to buy in Alabama or buy in Mississippi and you buy a catastrophic plan with a medium deductible and you're young and you have a heart attack or God forbid cancer or a bad accident, you'll be covered. But you don't need the care that an elderly person would and they're also being covered on the back end, right, through Medicaid and Medicare.
FLEISCHER: And you had all kinds of other benefits that were mandatory that people didn't need that was part of their premiums, which is why they're so expensive and their deductibles were so high.
Look, so much of it didn't work, Sean, because it was all moving in the direction of government control as opposed to what we always knows works, which is competition and much more free market. And what I think Donald Trump campaign bring to Washington is so needed from the outsider's perspective is that business sensibility about things that work and things that don't.
And when you always say, What can the government do first to do first to have a government run it, it won't work. When you say, What can be done to maximize the efficiencies of the private sector and deliver a quality product, that's what a private sector leader can do, and that's the Republican task now in Congress, is to follow it up and do that.
HANNITY: All right, by the way, I'm going to say good-buy to Ari...
GOOLSBEE: You guys better hope that he can do it.
HANNITY: Hang on a second. But Ari's got to leave, and he's a good friend and I'm -- it was my fault that was late a little earlier tonight. Ari, we appreciate it. Say -- send our best to you daughter.
Let me -- let me ask Austan this quick question. What did I possibly say that was nice about you? And was it a night that I was drinking? Was it New Year's Eve? What did I say?
(LAUGHTER)
GOOLSBEE: I don't know. You were drinking or something! You said that I was one of your favorites.
(CROSSTALK)
HANNITY: You should used believe in the free market more.
GOOLSBEE: I got a football from you that says -- I got a football from you that you signed and it says I'm a great American. I'm never giving that thing away!
HANNITY: OK. Yes, it's worth a fortune. Of course. But the reality -- why don't you -- look, you've got to understand there's not one economic statistic you can point which (ph) say we're better off. Millions more in poverty, on food stamps, lowest home ownership rate in 51 years, doubling...
GOOLSBEE: Sean...
HANNITY: ... of the national debt!
GOOLSBEE: I can give you one. You said I can't -- I'll name one.
HANNITY: What?
FLEISCHER: Longest string of private sector job growth in the history of United States.
HANNITY: All right, but...
COHEN: I don't even know again...
(CROSSTALK)
HANNITY: ... you extrapolate out one particular section and forget the rest of it, I can make anything look good.
COHEN: I mean, it just doesn't make any sense -- look, Donald Trump is the world's greatest deal maker. He's going to come in again with this ""Obama care."" It's -- he's going to be disruptive. He's going to bring in competition. Competition is going to lower the cost for everybody. You're not going to see these skyrocketing premiums. He knows what to do...
(CROSSTALK)
GOOLSBEE: I want that to be true. I'm not -- I'm not out to get...
HANNITY: Of course we...
(CROSSTALK)
COHEN: Who wouldn't want it to be true?
(CROSSTALK)
COHEN: ... everybody wants to see America...
HANNITY: So repeat after me.
COHEN: ... become great!
(CROSSTALK)
HANNITY: Austan, you want Trump to succeed where Obama failed.
GOOLSBEE: My point is this. Look, my point is this. Donald Trump, you remember, Sean, he came on the show during the campaign. And you asked him, What are you going to replace ""Obama care"" with? And his answer was, Something fabulous.
(CROSSTALK)
COHEN: Tell me, why are you expecting him to do this now? He's going to do it when he takes office! They're working on it. You don't even want to give the man a chance...
(CROSSTALK)
GOOLSBEE: I want to give him a chance, but...
(CROSSTALK)
HANNITY: He also said health savings accounts.
GOOLSBEE: Then give him the chance!
HANNITY: All right, guys. Good to see you both.
When we come back, President-elect Trump -- he promised to drain the swamp, and now this week, Texas senator Ted Cruz -- he introduced a constitutional amendment to impose term limits on lawmakers. Senator Cruz joins us next to explain.
And then later tonight...
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
ASSANGE: (INAUDIBLE) media in the United States felt that it was part of the same system. So Hillary Clinton was part of it.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
HANNITY: Part three of my never before seen exclusive interview with WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange. Tonight, he'll help explain why he does what he does.
Plus, a disturbing beating was broadcast on Facebook Live. Four African- Americans have been charged with a hate crime for brutally beating a white man with special needs. We'll get reaction from Michelle Malkin and more straight ahead.
HANNITY: And welcome back to ""Hannity."" So one of President-elect Donald Trump's campaign promises was to drain the swamp in Washington. So earlier this week, former 2016 presidential candidate Texas senator Ted Cruz -- he introduced an amendment that would implement term limits for lawmakers on Capitol Hill.
In a statement, Ted Cruz said, quote, ""D.C. is broken. The American people resoundingly agreed on election day and President-elect Trump has committed to putting government back to work for the American people. It's well past time to put an end to the cronyism and decent that has transformed Washington into a graveyard of good intentions."" What a powerful statement.
Joining us now to explain is the man himself, Texas Senator Ted Cruz. Senator, always good to see you. Welcome back, sir.
SEN. TED CRUZ, (R) TEXAS: Thank you, Sean. Great to be with you. Happy New Year.
HANNITY: Happy New Year to you, too. I've always aid about term limits, it's a good idea -- it's a bad idea whose time has come. It really would I think put politicians on track to do not what is in their best interest but to serve the people, which is not been happening in recent years, and I think you would agree, Republican, Democrat, it's gotten pretty bad.
CRUZ: Sean, that's exactly right. The American people overwhelmingly support term limits. And that's on a bipartisan basis. And the reason is simple. They recognize Washington is broken, that it's far too easy for people to come to Washington and become career politicians and get corrupted by the system where the special interests, the lobbyists begin supporting them. They stay there forever.
When the framers designed the constitution, they envisioned citizen legislators who would leave their job for a period of time, leave their businesses, their farms, come to Washington, serve the nation, and then go back. And we don't have that arrangement today. And so it's my hope that one of the first things we will see Republican majorities in both houses do is take up a constitutional amendment providing term limits, to two terms for senators, three terms for members of the House. And president-elect Trump campaign on that. It's one of the most effective ways to end the corruption in Washington and drain the swamp.
HANNITY: You know, you are one of just the few people that was willing to use your constitutional authority, the power of the purse, as it relates to Obamacare. It's now an item one agenda for the Trump administration. And you actually said yesterday that I'm really impressed with president-elect Trump. And I know, by the way, politics is a blood sport. It was very contentious with you guys at certain point, but you did keep your promise. You came around. You supported him, and probably you more than any candidate had the most contentious exchanges with him. Others didn't. That's an important aspect to remember. But do you feel that he can get these things done where the Republicans were not willing to fight in the past?
CRUZ: I certainly hope so. It was a vigorous primary but Donald Trump won the primary, and I'm very glad to say he won the general election. I was happy to campaign, supporting --
HANNITY: You were in Wisconsin. You were in Michigan with Mike Pence.
CRUZ: Yes. We went on the road with them, did everything we could to turn out conservatives. And that's what we saw. What we saw on Election Day was an incredible mandate for change. It was the American people saying enough is enough. They are fed up.
And Sean, I've got to tell you, I am really optimistic right now. I'm excited because we've been given an historic opportunity. It's something that doesn't happen very often, which is we've been given control of the White House, of every executive branch, of both houses of Congress. And what I think is critical now is that we actually deliver, that we do what we promised.
And I have been very, very encouraged by the cabinet appointments that president-elect Trump has put forward. This is an all-star team. These are strong conservatives. I just met a few minutes ago with General Mattis, spent about an hour with him. You want to talk about a serious, clear-eyed leader willing to stand up to radical Islamic terrorism, not bound by the political correctness, the willful blindness of the last eight years, talk about something we desperately need. I couldn't be more encouraged.
HANNITY: Even thought I know you guys became very adversarial during the primary, I actually believe that you could be a very powerful team, especially on Obamacare, defeating radical Islam, border security, repealing and replacing Obamacare, the Supreme Court, which I thought was the number one issue in this campaign. I think this could be a powerful alliance that maybe nobody predicted at the time.
One thing else that I am really thankful that you came out and said Congress must cut taxpayer funding of the U.N. for the disgraceful anti- Israeli resolution that the Obama administration, they could have vetoed and they didn't and they may have even colluded on it.
CRUZ: That's exactly right. If you look at the last several weeks, but the Obama administration has done, it's been shameful. Really their true colors are coming out where on the way out they struck out at Israel in a way that is hateful and profoundly damaging.
The U.N. resolution that passed with Barack Obama and John Kerry's active acquiescence, if not their encouragement, is profoundly anti-Israel. It is absurd. It actually declares much of Israel to be illegal and illegitimate. It declares the Temple Mount, the holiest place in Jerusalem for Jews, to be not legitimately part of Israel. It declares the Western Wall, where Jews from all over the world go to pray, to be illegal and not part of Israel.
And for decades the United States has stood as an ally of Israel at the United Nations against anti-Semitism, and I think Barack Obama did this because he wanted to secure his legacy. And I've got to tell you, Sean, I think he has. I think history is going to record Barack Obama and John Kerry as relentless enemies of Israel.
HANNITY: You know what's funny, senator, we talk about influencing elections. This president spent taxpayer money from the State Department to incent his political operatives to help defeat Prime Minister Netanyahu.
CRUZ: That is exactly right. The antipathy from this administration to Israel and to its elected leader Prime Minister Netanyahu is astonishing. And I spoke with Prime Minister Netanyahu a little over a week ago. And I shared with him despite this disgraceful action in the U.N., the American people stand unshakably with the people of Israel. And I am joining with my colleague Lindsay Graham -- Lindsay and I disagree on a lot of issue, but on this issue we are on the same page. We are joining together, introducing legislation --
HANNITY: Good luck with that one. He's not exactly my favorite senator, by the way. You are in the butter category. But anyway, senator, good to see you.
CRUZ: We are going to cut off funding to the U.N. unless and until they reverse this resolution.
HANNITY: Do you know if the president-elect suppors that? I would love to see him support that.
CRUZ: I'll tell you, we are working very, very closely with the president- elect and the transition team. Every day we're working closely with them.
HANNITY: That's really good news. All right, senator, thank you, good to see you.
CRUZ: Thank you, Sean.
HANNITY: And up next tonight right here on HANNITY.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
JULIAN ASSANGE, FOUNDER, WIKILEAKS: Why are we interested in publishing information about power? Because people can do things with power, they can do very bad things with power. If they are incompetent, they can do dangerous things.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
HANNITY: More of my exclusive unaired interview with WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.
And then later, four African-Americans charged with a hate crime for the brutal beating of a white man with special needs. They literally forced him to drink toilet water and cut off his clothing and his scalp and yelled anti-Donald Trump and anti-white slurs. That disturbing tape and much more reaction from Michelle Malkin straight ahead.
HANNITY: Welcome back to HANNITY. So during my exclusive interview with WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange earlier this week, I asked him if he believes that governments are honest to you, the American people, and elsewhere around the world? This previously un-aired portion of the interview is right here.
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
HANNITY: Do you believe that their governments that regularly lie, propagandize, manipulate the minds of their citizens?
ASSANGE: Yes, very much.
HANNITY: And you want to expose that truth to people?
ASSANGE: Yes.
HANNITY: Regardless of whether it's Republican or Democrat, no political agenda.
ASSANGE: Absolutely, absolutely.
HANNITY: And that question then goes back to the fourth estate. This is the biggest media story. Why won't will the media do it? If I have information that Hillary Clinton is colluding with the media, that Hillary Clinton is benefiting --
ASSANGE: Why won't the media do it? You just answered the question. Why won't the media, because four-fifths of the media many in the United States felt that it was part of the same system, that Hillary Clinton was part of the same social strata, benefiting politically and socially and financially from that system that Hillary Clinton most represented.
HANNITY: Let me ask this question, you are taking on the big, the mighty, the powerful. I don't sense a political agenda because you're telling if it was Donald Trump's emails you would've released those.
ASSANGE: We did release Sarah Palin's emails. We released Norm Coleman's information back in 2009.
HANNITY: So my question then is, so you really don't have an agenda except to tell the truth that with regularity bureaucracy, government entities lie and prevent the people they represent from hearing the truth. A fair statement?
ASSANGE: Yes. Not only lie and act in a duplicitous manner and do things that are harmful to the population inside the country and up, but they act in an incompetent manner. They are full of incompetent people. And the more secretive the area is the more incompetent it become because there is no proper oversight. You can't go this guy did a good job. This guy did a bad job, because you can't compare.
HANNITY: You are saying transparency will lead to competence.
ASSANGE: Exactly.
HANNITY: And government don't by their very nature --
ASSANGE: They hate transparency. They loathe it because they have to work harder.
HANNITY: But this is also -- let me ask this question. This is an evil world we live in. We live in a world where convert or die, Allahu Akbar, kill in the name of Allah, you do believe government should have secrets, covert operations, plausible deniability. You're never going to be able to hold them accountable to that.
ASSANGE: WikiLeaks has secrets. We protect our sources. OK, so that's a core area of competency that we have to keep information secret. Investigating the mafia, the police have to keep their investigations secret. All the time it takes them to get to trial. Not forever. The time it takes to get to trial. Sometimes your doctor, for example, maybe there's a reason to keep something secret there. So secrecy should be as small as possible in how much it encompasses and for how long it is encompassed. But there's a place for it.
HANNITY: You never set out to have a goal to influence this election. That was not your goal, you are saying.
ASSANGE: Not one way or the other. Did we set out to give the American people true information about the players that they were going to have to deal with? Yes, of course.
HANNITY: What do you think --
ASSANGE: You know, we don't publish -- we are not in the business of publishing stuff about fluff. We are in the business of publishing things about power. Why are we interested in publishing information about power? Because people can things with power. They can do very bad things with power. If they are incompetent things they can do dangerous things. If they're evil they can do wicked things.
So we are interested in publishing information about power so those people have to deal with power, all of us, can go, OK, well, I don't like that guy. I'm not going to deal with him. I'm not going to vote for him. Or, that guy sounds all right. Maybe I want a business relationship with him. Maybe he should marry my sister.
If you don't know what is happening in the world with the powerful individuals, corporations, and governments, you can't decide whether you're going to support them or not support them, get into some kind of relationship with them or not. And as a result, immoral actors within the state or within those big corporations prosper. If you have true information coming out about how people actually behave, what's the result? The rest of society goes, you know what, I don't want to deal with you.
(END VIDEOTAPE)
HANNITY: And coming up, a disgusting, a brutal assault was broadcasted on Facebook live by four attackers. They were African-American and all have now been charged with hate crime. The attackers, they shouted anti-Trump remarks as they tortured a man with special needs. Michelle Malkin is here with reaction. That's straight ahead.
HANNITY: Welcome back to HANNITY. It is the disturbing story everybody is talking about. Four African-Americans from Chicago area have been charged with a hate crime as well as a variety of other offences after kidnapping a special-needs white man, torturing him with a knife, and even making him drink water from a toilet, all while ranting about white people and president-elect Donald Trump.
According to authorities this ordeal lasted for hours and the attackers even broadcasted a portion of their brutal assault on Facebook Live. Before we air this, we've got to warn you. This video we are about to show you is extremely disturbing. Watch this.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: -- Donald Trump -- white people.
(LAUGHTER)
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: This my friend.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
HANNITY: All right, joining us now with reaction, syndicated columnist, host of the series ""Michelle Malkin Investigates,"" it's on CRTV.com, our friend Michelle Malkin. I don't even -- I understand kids and pranks. I was a bit of an incorrigible child myself. I don't understand the evil, the outright evil. They were literally taking this kids scalp with a knife, forcing him and beating him. I don't understand this kind of evil. I don't know where it comes from, how this evolves. What is your reaction to it?
MICHELLE MALKIN, ""MICHELLE MALKIN INVESTIGATES"" HOST: Sean, I think that every parent in America, particularly parents of special needs kids, has to be outraged and disgusted by what was broadcast on Facebook. And the ways in which social media now is spreading this kind of violent poison, it is alarming. And the atrocity, the brutality that occurred, what was depicted in this video is compounded by the callous reaction of so many people on the left and in the media where some crimes are more equal than others. And where this agenda driven journalism has been exposed so nakedly, Sean. The ways of which the racial aspect of this crime has been covered up by so many leftists --
HANNITY: Yes, they had a hard time reaching the fact that this was a racial hate crime. But here's another part of the equation that we've got to talk about. We've dealt with this a little bit on the program last night. Nearly 800 killed in Chicago this year alone. Since Obama has been president nearly 5,000 killed, 4,000 shot this year.
MALKIN: Well, because Chicago is the poster child of the violent and sick hellhole of progressivism. And it lies squarely at the feet of the likes of Rahm Emanuel, the Democratic daily machine and, yes, President Obama and his wife themselves who come from Chicago. I've talked many times with you, Sean, over the years about the progressive climate of hate, whether it is the hate that's been fermented by CAIR and Black Lives Matter and Sothern Poverty Law Center which gets to define what hate crimes are, and where they falsely accuse the right. It is always blame right people.
Liberals, you know what, liberal ignore racism within their own ranks. They make it up when it doesn't exist. And they manufacture it for their own political gain. Shame on them.
HANNITY: Fake hate crimes versus real hate crimes. Great point. Michelle, by the way, happy New York, and we are really glad you're back on the show. Good to see you. Congrats on your new gig.
MALKIN: Thank you, Sean.
HANNITY: I appreciate it. Coming up, we need your help, a very important, very important ""Question of the Day,"" and we always love your input, straight ahead.
HANNITY: Are time for our ""Question of the Day."" So do you think the Democrats, as I do, are playing politics over this election so-called hacking issue? Look at my opening monoluge. Go to Facebook.com/SeanHannity, @SeanHannity on Twitter, let us know what you think.
Unfortunately, that is all the time we have left this evening. And we'll see you back here tomorrow night."
0	20	 21 von 72	Fox News Network	January 5, 2017 Thursday	 THE KELLY FILE	 9:00 PM EST		" MEGYN KELLY, THE KELLY FILES ANCHOR: ""BREAKING TONIGHT"", President Obama has now weighed in after police decided to file hate crime charges against the suspects accused of a horrifying act in Chicago. But we may only be seeing the start of the uproar over a video of the mentally disabled young man being tortured -- we brought this to you last night. Welcome to THE KELLY FILE, everyone. I'm Megyn Kelly.
Four people, including two sisters, ranging from ages 18 to 24 -- three were 18, one was 24 -- are now being charged with hate crimes for their role in the despicable attack in which one of them decided to pull out a camera and broadcast it on Facebook live. The 30-minute video in itself was disturbing enough and police say this poor young man's ordeal likely lasted up to five hours. But a lot of folks were caught off-guard by the fact that police were initially suggesting hate-crime charges were not a guarantee considering scenes like this, from the video on question.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (BLEEP) Donald Trump. (BLEEP) people, boy. (BLEEP) them.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE VOICE: Goof. (INAUDIBLE) My sister. (INAUDIBLE)
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE VOICE: Well, my sister said this not funny, y'all.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
KELLY: But it went on for hours, hours. And the list of things they did to this young man is disgusting. Chicago PD today defended their decision to delay the charges saying, they just didn't want to let their emotions get ahead of the facts when it comes to hate crime charges. And while President Obama is calling the case, quote, ""despicable"", in a new interview -- despicable is the word. He is insisting that race relations have gotten better and that this kind of thing can, in some ways, have a silver lining.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
BARRACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: I promise you, for the most part, race relations have gotten better. But I think what we've seen over the last several years when it comes to tensions between police and communities, the internet horrific hate crimes and the sort that we appeared to have seen.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: On Facebook, yeah. What is your reaction to that actually - the Facebook video?
OBAMA: Oh, it's terrible. We don't benefit from pretending that racism doesn't exist and hate doesn't exist. We don't benefit from not talking about it. The fact that these things are being surfaced means we can solve them.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
KELLY: Attorneys Mark Eiglarsh and Scott Bolden are here on the crime in a moment. Katie Pavlich and Julie Roginsky will join us in a political fight as well, but first, we start with Trace Gallagher live in our West Coast Newsroom, Trace?
TRACE GALLAGHER, FOX NEWS CHANNEL ANCHOR: Megyn, after being held for days and tortured for hours, police say the mentally disabled victim was only able to escape because a neighbor who lives below his captors threatened to call police because of the noise. And when the attackers went down to confront the neighbor, the 18-year-old victim ran out of the house and was soon spotted by police. Despite the brutal Chicago weather, the victim who has not been named, was wearing a tank top and sandals. Investigators say the suspects, two men and two sisters confessed to the crimes. Watch.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: They admit that they were beating him, kicking him, they made him drink toilet water, and then obviously, the video where they're cutting a piece of his scalp.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
GALLAGHER: And after cutting his scalp, the attackers laughed about how much he was bleeding. During the 30-minute live Facebook stream, you could see the victim with his wrist and head bound, his mouth taped shut, cowering against the wall with voices repeatedly shouting, ""F Donald Trump, F white people"". The victim was also asked about black people, watch.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Get on your knees. Kiss the floor right now, kiss the floor.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: No!
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Kiss the floor before I kick you in your (BLEEP)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Kiss the floor, bro. Kiss the floor (BLEEP) Say I love black people.
VICTIM: I love black people.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Say I love black people.
VICTIM: I love black people.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
GALLAGHER: Chicago police now say that hate crime charges were never in question, but just yesterday said, they hadn't determine, quote, ""Whether this is sincere or just stupid ranting and raving."" Reports on social media linked the suspects to the Black Lives Matter Movement, but Chicago police say they have found no connection. The victim told police he went to school with one of the attackers and that the incident began as a play fight that escalated into what the Chicago mayor calls ""sickening"" and the president calls ""despicable"". Megyn?
KELLY: Trace, thank you. Turning me now to debate Mark Eiglarsh, a Criminal Defense Attorney and Former Prosecutor, and Scott Bolden, an Attorney and a Former Chairman of the DC Democratic Party. Good to see you both.
SCOTT BOLDEN, FORMER CHAIRMAN OF THE DC DEMOCRATIC PARTY: So Mark, you know, this -- it seems like a clear hate crime. If you look at -- you know, that it's been charged as one now. And, I don't see what the debate is. You can -- it's a hate crime if you target somebody because of their race or because of their mental disability. And he was mentally challenged and they specifically referenced his race in the video.
[21:05:12] MARK EIGLARSH, CHIEF CRIMINAL DEFENSE ATTORNEY: I agree with you, Megyn. I tried to take the other side, let's keep an open mind. I looked at it. And I don't think one single fact makes it conclusitory. I think you've got to look at each separate fact. I think that the racial slur, coupled with the other facts here, give enough for prosecutors to charge this as a hate crime. And then you look at the fact that he's weak, he's mentally disabled. It's right there in the statute, it makes it very clear. If you select your victim because of that, then it is a hate crime. I don't see the dispute.
Kelly: What is the argument that it isn't, Scott?
BOLDEN: Yeah, here's the thing. While the video is reprehensible, the fact of the matter is that as criminal defense attorney, I am more interested in what is happening not on that video. Remember there's a prior relationship. Very hard to prove a crime when there's prior relationship.
KELLY: No, it's not.
BOLDEN: If it wanted - well, yes it is, because the credibility issues --
KELLY: It's hard to prove a crime or it's hard to prove a hate crime?
BOLDEN: It's hard to prove both if there's a prior relationship in this regard.
KELLY: It's not hard to prove a crime, here. They tortured the man, they made him drink out of a toilet. They sliced his neck.
BOLDEN: You're absolutely right. But was the impetus and what triggered that crime was he targeted because he had a mental health issue or was because he was white? They picked him --
(CROSSTALK)
KELLY: Now, you're onto whether it's a hate crime. Now, that's - I'm trying to make a distinction here because you're saying it's hard to charge a crime and I submit to you.
BOLDEN: No.
KELLY: Having breakfast (INAUDIBLE) for almost a decade -- it's not hard at all. They nailed it. Aggravated kidnapping, battery, and on and on the charges went. The only question is the hate crime addition.
BOLDEN: I don't - I don't disagree with the charges. But is it a hate crime, was he kidnapped, was he assaulted because he was a white or mentally challenged or was it because it was a play fight and some other reason? You still got to prove --
(CROSSTALK)
KELLY: All right, now you're onto something. OK, now you're onto something, Mark, because, yes, they said they mentioned his race; yes, they mentioned Donald Trump; yes, he was mentally challenged, but they were friends and apparently they had some sort of an altercation -- a fight. I don't know if it was verbal or physical that preceded the five-hour torture. And so, the question will be whether it was that fight or whatever that was about that led to this event.
EIGLARSH: Absolutely, the arguments that he makes are relevant ones in front of a jury, but let's be real for a second. Look at these facts. Where do you think the jury is going to lean when it comes to deciding which way they should go? Whether they should count this as a hate crime or not.
KELLY: Well, does it matter? Let me ask you this, Mark. Does it -- why does it matter if they - if they - if they charge him with a hate crime? Because he's looking at 30 years, all four of these people are --
EIGLARSH: That's a great question. Yeah.
KELLY: -- are in prison for 30 years potentially if they got convicted.
EIGLARSH: It's a great question. People need to understand. They're going to be charged with doing these up hard acts like kidnapping and aggravated battery.
BOLDEN: Exactly.
EIGLARSH: And they're looking at decades in prison for that. The hate crime nearly elevates the potential sentence that they could - that could be imposed. It doesn't - you know, we're having this debate just to see if they can get more time because it's a hate crime. But really, you can say it's fine that it's not.
KELLY: But realistically, Scott, realistically - OK. We don't know anything about priors or anything like that with these three. Three are 18, so they were juveniles up until last year -- one 24. So realistically, if they were to be convicted on this sort of litany of charges, what kind of --really, I mean, they're not going to jail for 30 years, so what would it be?
BOLDEN: Well, you got the -- if they prove the hate crime, the felony two and the felony three could -- they could get three to seven more years or five to - five to nine more years on the Illinois law. And so, that's really what you're going to be looking at. Now, the reality is they've got to prove the crime first, and then the sentence enhancements of the hate crimes are what get tracked on by the judge or the jury. So, they've got to get that conviction.
KELLY: They're going to have to plea. This is going to be bled out. I mean, there's this -- look at the video. 30 minutes long.
EIGLARSH: But Megyn, don't be so sure. It's a slap on the wrist. They're going to get time. They're going to get time. They should.
BOLDEN: They are, but look for one or two to plead out and corroborate against the others, because that is going to strengthen the case. Look for that. We'll be watching for a while.
(CROSSTALK)
KELLY: Uh-hmm. The ringleader, whoever it was. All right, guys, got to go. Good to see you both.
Well, some folks in the media are also being blamed for the uproar over this story with one writer suggesting that the industry may need to do some serious soul-searching in the wake of what we've seen written about this case. New York Posts' staff, Seth Mandel was referring to what he called the string of fake pro Trump -- pro-Trump hate crimes. You know, where people say that Trump supporters went out there to beat down Trump non- supporters, saying that those are not giving way to monstrous real anti- Trump hate crimes. The Washington Post's columnist Callum Borchers is now taking some heat for framing the story as the convergence of what he called ""Pro-Trump narratives"" and one panellist on MSNBC seems to be suggesting that these suspects were too stupid to be criminals.

MSNBC PANELIST: Well, I mean, you look at it on the surface you think, you know, kids can make some really poor decisions from time to time. But because they made so many errors here, if they were truly trying to be criminal to obviously broadcast your crime is not a smart thing to do.

KELLY: Katie Pavlich is a Fox News contributor in Townhall.com news editor; and Julie Roginsky is also a Fox News contributor and Democratic Analyst. Good to see you both.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Good to see you.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Hi, Megyn.
KELLY: Let me just start with Callum Borchers whose -- I think he's actually, usually great in the Washington Post. This one, he's taking a lot of heat for because he's suggesting that if the attackers had been white and the victim had been black, that the incident would have conjured America's ugly history of white mobs committing crimes against black people. But there's no parallel history of the reverse happening on anything remotely approaching the same scale and people feel that he was diminishing the seriousness here, and that that this could be more easily dismissed and not put into a greater narrative given this country's history. Your thoughts on it, Katie.
KATIE PAVLICH, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, it does diminish the horrible situation at hand and it goes and plays into the narrative that a lot of people in the liberal media, leftists believe that hate crimes can only be committed by white people against minorities which obviously is not the case in this situation. For him to say that this is pro Trump narratives wrapped up in a horrible incident when in this video they're specifically talking about being anti-Trump, saying that, you know, very racist, anti- white things to this mentally disabled young man doesn't add up with the facts and it just feeds the narrative that they actually do believe that hate crimes can only be committed by white people. Which is not true.--
KELLY: Julie, he's -- Callum is talking about -- he says The Huffington Post survey conducted in November shows 45 percent of Trump voters believe white people face a lot of discrimination, just 22 percent of Trump voters said the same about Black people facing a lot of discrimination and he feels that this worldview of many Trump voters is not supported by the data, but now they can find support in this one awful video.
JULIE ROGINSKY, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR AND DEMOCRATIC ANALYST: You know, I don't want to diminish or feed into larger narrative about this video from either the right or the left. What happened to me, I'm not a lawyer, certainly, and I thought your previous segment laid out the controversies to whether this is or not a hate crime. To me, from a human perspective, it is a hate crime for the many reasons that people have outlined in covering the story. And so, let's not diminish by saying, if Katie is to the leftists or anybody else. I am from the left, I am as liberal as it gets. But on this particular issue, to me, this is a hate crime. And it's a hate crime when somebody is saying the horrible things that they said with racial overtones. Apparently, there were - there were chants of go vote Trump or -
KELLY: But the question is - but the question is whether the media would be reacting differently to the tape, Katie, if the races of the assailants and the victim were reversed. Having said that, there has been a lot of coverage on this. But the critics claim not as much as it would've been otherwise.
PAVLICH: Well, they're not as much as it would've been otherwise, and let's go back to the beginning of when the story broke, OK. So after the election, Buzzfeed ran the story of 28 alleged hate crimes in the - in the post Trump election era, with very little evidence, very few police reports filed as a result of these hate crimes of pro-Trump supporters against people from maybe voting for Hillary Clinton, and yet, here we are today in the original story from the AP. It didn't mention the races of the attacker, the alleged attackers or the victim and that certainly wouldn't have been the case. And it does fit into this narrative that, you know, white supremacy is prevalent in America that we've heard over the past six months to a year that only white people can commit hate crimes against minorities. It can never be the reverse.
And so, it certainly would have been painted differently, and I doubt that we would have seen headlines like, oh, this situation that we've seen play out on Facebook, this horrific crime, is just a compilation of anti-Hillary Clinton sentiment. I mean, come on. You know, I mean, this whole woe is me, the New York Times mentioned the race of these assailants, every mainstream media outlet that I've read, that has covered this -
(CROSSTALK)
KELLY: Why would the AP missed that?
ROGINSKY: I don't know why the AP would do it. I'm telling you, I read the New York Times every day and they mentioned it, and that's as mainstream as it gets. Look, don't try to somehow politicize this or make this some sort of woe is me conservative issue. This -- from every spectrum, democrat, republican, liberal, conservative, we all agree this is an awful crime. I think it's a hate crime, maybe not legally, but morally, certainly, it's a hate crime. The races have been mentioned tremendously, I just don't like the narrative of suddenly saying this is somehow woe is me, white people are getting oppressed when this has nothing to do with it. It's an awful crime. Let's not diminish it by politicizing it.
KELLY: Well, you could argue that the assailants politicized it with reference to Donald Trump.
ROGINSKY: That's true. Absolutely so, in fact. But we should not.
(CROSSTALK)
KELLY: All right, guys, great to see you both. Thank you.
PAVLICH: Thanks, Megyn.
KELLY: Well, on the same day America's Intel Chiefs went public with their case for how Russia, they say, interfered in the 2016 election. Former CIA Director and veteran Intelligence Expert, James Woolsey, decided to resign from the Trump transition team. He's here to tell us why, next.
Plus, new reports that President Obama is leaving some legislative landmines for the Trump team. Oh, legislative landmines, you say. And Charles Krauthammer is here to detail the danger.
Plus, the latest news about Hillary Clinton's political future. Yes, her political future. And the surprising role, she is reportedly considering - - guess what she might run for? Brian Kilmeade has the scoop, and a busy night here on the KELLY FILE.
KELLY: ""BREAKING TONIGHT"" -- top U.S. intelligence experts doubling down on their assessment that and Russia meddled in the 2016 elections in an unprecedented and wide-ranging operation. But the Intel chiefs stopped short of saying why the Kremlin did it. Apparently, we're getting that next week. After weeks of anonymous leaks, allegedly tying Russia to an attempt to throw the election to President-elect Donald Trump, the director of National Intelligence James Clapper today walked right up the edge. Chief Intelligence Correspondent Catherine Herridge was there for all of it, she's alive in Washington tonight with the very latest, Catherine.
CATHERINE HERRIDGE, FOX NEWS CHIEF INTELLIGENCE CORRESPONDENT: Megyn, no one testified on the record today that the Russian president was pulling the strings. No one said publicly the attempt was to help Donald Trump win and make sure Hillary Clinton lost. But they nation's spy chief did confirm, Russia wants to expand its influence.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
JAMES CLAPPER, DIRECTOR OF NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE: The Russians are bent on establishing presence in the western hemisphere.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
HERRIDGE: The witnesses said Russian interference was multifaceted including the fact that the DNC and Clinton campaign e-mails as well as fake news, but they never found evidence that the ballots were tampered with. Though, they were pressed many times, the witnesses seem to avoid calling out the Russian President Vladimir Putin by name and they emphasized the meddling came from the top.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
[21:20:10] CLAPPER: Had the same conclusion with respect to the involvement of high-level Russian authorities is shared by the -- all these agencies?
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
HERRIDE: The president got a classified briefing today and there is an unclassified version that should be public on Monday that's supposed to address who was behind the meddling and why.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Do you think in the report next week that you all will ascribe a motivation to Putin for the election attempt?
CLAPPER: Yes, we will ascribe a motivation. I'd rather not, again, pre- empt the report.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This is ascertaining the motives, plans and intentions of foreign leaders among the hardest tasks that we ask our intelligence services to perform --
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It always has been.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
HERRIDGE: Fox News has confirmed tonight that the classified report does identify who delivered the stolen e-mails to WikiLeaks. Congress was told today that Russian intelligence routinely masquerades these third parties and hides behind online personas to confuse the people who get the documents. The president-elect will get his briefing midday tomorrow, Megyn.
KELLY: Catherine, thanks.
HERRIDGE: You're welcome.
KELLY: Joining us now, Former CIA Director, James Woolsey. Who just hours ago, resigned from president-elect Trump's transition team where he was serving as a senior advisor. Mr. Woolsey is a veteran of four administrations and one of the nation's leading and most respected intelligence agents experts. James, good to see you, thank you for being here tonight.
JAMES WOOSLEY, FORMER CIA DIRECTOR: Good to see you, Megyn.
KELLY: So, why did you do that, why did you resign?
WOOLSEY: Well, I didn't actually resign. What I said was that I want to be known that I was not working on the transition. I had helped to some of the campaign. And then during the transition I was doing -- speaking mainly to the press and explaining the -
KELLY: But why was that important to you, to make that distinction, to let people know that you didn't have the role that people were suggesting you did?
WOOSLEY: Well, the campaign was over. And I didn't want to have it, when they announced me on television and so forth. I didn't want them to keep saying that I was a senior advisor on the transition, because I really wasn't. And I didn't think it was right to claim something that was not the case.
KELLY: But this suggestion is, by the Washington Post tonight that, it wasn't just a matter of ""I wasn't"". They were saying it was a matter of he stopped using you. That you are not being -- you had been excluded in recent weeks from discussions and Intel matters, and that you felt that you were being misrepresented as an advisor when he wasn't using you. He was excluding you.
WOOSLEY: I didn't feel I was being misrepresented. But I was not really called upon to you know, go to meetings or participate in work on the transition. I spent a lot of time back grounding the press on -- and on record talking to the press and explaining positions of the Trump organization. Particularly on the National security matters.
KELLY: But what about the Washington Post tonight -- Phil Rocker is reporting that you were taken aback by this week's reports that Trump is considering revamping our intelligence framework. And then there was another person close to you who spoke to The Post who said you chafed to Trump's loose style on Twitter given that you are very principled diplomat. They're suggesting there's more to this than you're letting on tonight. Is that reporting accurate?
WOOSLEY: Well, I think it's important to realize that there are more than one way to reform intelligence and I've been on this issue quite a bit for some time since before 9/11 when I was face - back in the -- 25 years ago with the need to deal with some organizational matters for the Intelligence Community and also, more recently post 9/11. And I think the direction that the reforms have taken is not a good one. There are a lot of weaknesses and problems -- we can talk about sometime when you have time.
KELLY: Do support then Trumps reported plan to revamp the intelligence framework? He's actually denying that he's going to do that.
WOOSLEY: Depends where it goes. I think that this organization ought to at least, particularly for the clandestine services, look a lot more like the OSS than what it looks like today, which is a very bureaucratic structure and it needs to have some changes made. I don't know what kind of changes that are being considered by Mr. Trump.
KELLY: (INAUDIBLE) I just need to press you, Jim. I apologize, you're a gentleman for coming on. But I do want to give you the chance. Are you challenging the reporting by the Washington Post tonight?
[21:24:47] WOOSLEY: Well, it - no, I think they were focused on an important issue which is what type of change is going to be proposed in the Intelligence Community's organization especially by the Trump administration in two weeks. And I can't tell. What I can tell is that what I see now, that as a result of reforms over the last couple years, I do not think is sound, and need some rather substantial attention.
KELLY: Uh-hmm. Great to see you, sir. Thanks for coming on.
WOOSLEY: Good to see you.
KELLY: Tonight, new revelations about how this transition is really going. And what the Obama administration is quietly leaving behind for Team Trump, they got a little surprise for Team Trump. Charles Krauthammer knows what it is, he's here next.
Plus, should New York City be able to hide the identities of thousands of undocumented immigrants -- illegal immigrants from the feds. That fight is just ahead.
KELLY: ""DEVELOPING"" tonight, with just 15 days to go until a peaceful transition of power, new questions on just how far the outgoing administration is willing to go when it comes to the incoming administration. Team Obama's recent spate of progressive policy moves is now prompting some to ask, is there a plan in place to undermine the Trump administration long after inauguration day? We've got Charles Krauthammer here on that, but first, Trace Gallagher reports on the growing tension in the two administrations, Trace?
GALLAGHER: Megyn, the Democratic leader of the California Senate says when it comes to immigration policy, the environment, and criminal justice, Donald Trump is a quote, clear and present danger to the prosperity of California, so now state law makers have hired former Attorney General Eric Holder to represent them in any legal fights against the Federal Government, for example, Donald Trump's vow to go after the Sanctuary City that protect illegal immigrants. We should note Eric Holder is now with the D.C. law firm specializes in fighting the feds. California lawmakers are paying Holder's firm $25,000 a month but say they believe in the end, he will save the state money. Critics say California Democratic lawmakers who control two-thirds of the state legislator forgot to mention the state's economy is still struggling and the public pension system is about $400 billion in debt. Here's what California GOP Congressman Darrell Issa had to say about his home state hiring holder, watch.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
DARREL ISSA, CHAIR HOUSE OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE: He has a bad choice, but apparently it's more of a political statement. Millions of dollar, tax payer's dollars spent on somebody who probably shouldn't have a law license any longer.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
GALLAGHER: In the meantime, while President Obama is spending his last days in office trying to cement his legacy and firmly establish his policies, come noon on January 20th, the then former president will be riding off into the Texas sunset like his predecessor. Instead the Obama's will be watching the new administration from just down the road in D.C., ostensibly to allow Sasha to finish high school. The Obama will live in the exclusive Kalorama neighborhood. He will be the first president to immediately remain in D.C. after leaving the White House since Woodrow Wilson left office in 1921. Vice President Joe Biden says he is leaving D.C. but he won't be quiet. Biden says he sees enormous challenges and opportunity ahead for Democrats. And that he will be on hand to help from the sidelines, Megyn.
MEGYN KELLY, FOX NEWS SHOW HOST: Trace, thank you. Joining us now, Fox News Contributor and National Syndicated Columnist Dr. Charles Krauthammer, he has been watching the Obama White House unfold for the past two terms, so, Charles what do you think?
CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR AND NATIONAL SYNDICATED COLUMNIST: Look, all those things are true. But I think they are unconnected. What California is doing is taking its overwhelmingly Democratic. They are taking a page from what Republicans did when they were out of power. They used the states, the Attorney General of the states, to go to the courts and to try to stop Obama in places where the congress was unable to. And they succeeded in doing that that on the environment, and also unblocking these immigrations laws. So, I think the Democrats have decided we are going to do the guerrilla warfare from the states. As for Obama, he has leaving office as a very young man and he is been rejected by the country. He can see the Trump agenda, the Republican agenda in control of all branches. He is prepared to systematically dismantle everything he did and make him a parenthesis in American history. So, I think it's natural he'd want to stay and fight. As for Biden, no one has been able to keep him quiet since 1979 so I'm not surprised by that news.
KELLY: But what you make of it, it is strange when you compare what George W. Bush did upon leaving office, because a pundit could have said the same thing about when he left that President Obama was going to systematically dismantle the Bush agenda, that he had been clearly rejected and so on. But he didn't stick around to watch it. Granted, President Obama has a young daughter in school and he wants her to finish. But the notion that this team, once they are out of office they are going to stay and continue fighting the will of the American people is very different than what we saw eight years ago.
KRAUTHAMMER: Look at what Obama did today. He essentially wrote a letter justifying his eight years in office. When presidents leave office, they generally don't make a plea on their own behalf. It's beneath them. I mean Eisenhower gave a farewell address, it was about the country. Obama is not going to give one next week. I guarantee it will be about himself. This really is a matter of -- narcissism is probably overstating it, but he says his own reputation is at stake. I don't think George W cared as much. He figured history will decide how he did in the end and he wouldn't metal in that. And he also, I think as a matter of sort of decency, you let your success or operate. See how he does. And don't heckle him from the sidelines. I'm not sure Obama plays on the same table.
KELLY: So you talk about legacy, right? That they are worried about the legacy now, I guess to get the right messaging out there, if they can cheat it at this point. They get it, I mean as presidency and we saw some of this, from Valerie Jarrett the president's top advisor this past weekend, who pretty shockingly said this. Listen.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
VALERIE JARRETT, PRESIDENT'S TOP ADVISOR: the president prides himself on the fact that his administrations haven't had a scandal and he hasn't done anything to embarrass himself. But that is not because he is being someone other than who he is. That is because that is who he is. I think that'll resonate with the American people.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
KELLY: Just off the top of my head, I'm thinking, Benghazi? Do you like your plan? You can keep your plan. That is just an out falsehood that resulted in outrage of millions of people being misled. I mean the IRS. You could go on.
KRAUTHAMMER: It is a very long list. But I think Jarrett was adopting the Clintonian definition of scandal. Which means sexual hygiene's and stealing the silver from the White House as you leave.
KELLY: That is exactly what happened with the Clinton administration. You have a good point.
KRAUTHAMMER: It literally happened with the Clinton. I can assure you it would not happen with the Obama's. By that standard this is being scandal free and you've got to give them credit. Eight years without the kind of rumors and innuendo that you generally get about the personal conduct of the president. They have been fairly clean on that, but when you are talking about assault on the constitution, stepping over the separation of powers. Saying that the congress won't act, I will which is a contradiction of the whole idea of eliminated executive. Those are scandalous and they are far more damaging. So I give her a pass on the minor point, but on the major point, it is truly astonishing to hear it. And I'll bet you she believes it.
KELLY: I mean, you know. Four dead people in Benghazi, Libya, who are left there with inadequate security for what the U.S. congress suggested, were political reasons on the Anniversary of 9/11, including an Ambassador. It is somewhat scandalous, but we will leave it to the American people to have the final judgment on that, Charles great to see you.
KRAUTHAMMER: My pleasure.
KELLY: So ahead, the new reports surrounding Hillary Clinton and why her political career could be taking a new turn. It gets what she might run for? Brian Kilmeade has that, plus, a fight underway in New York City over a record of thousands of people who are here illegally. And a new move to destroy all of those records. Why? Guy Benson and Robert Zimmerman are here to tell you, next.
From the world headquarters of Fox News, it's ""The Kelly File."" with Megyn Kelly.
KELLY: Developing tonight, accusations that City officials in New York are threatening our national security with a move to design to protect thousands of those who are here illegally from ever being identified by the Trump administration. Fox News David Lee Miller has the report.
DAVID LEE MILLER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Megyn, New York City officials were in court today, explaining why this city has the right to destroy records connected municipal I.D. program. The program was created under the administration of Democratic Mayor De Blasio to help city residents who have no form of recognized identification. Most applicants are undocumented immigrants. A provision of the 2-year-old law creating the I.D. Program allows the city to purge I.D. data and documents at the start of this year. The delete option was designed to prevent a future Republican administration from using that information to deport undocumented immigrants. Two state lawmakers, however, have gone to court demanding that the city I.D. card data not be destroyed. They argue it is not about immigration, but criminal activity.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
RON CASTORINA JR, NEW YORK STATE ASSEMBLYMAN: This case has nothing to do with immigration and everything to do with the IDNYC Program and the fact that the card is scantly vetted and then in conjunction with the ability to obtain bank accounts, it becomes a major security at risk.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
LEE MILLER: According to city records since the I.D. Program gone under way, there have been 102 cases of fraud related to obtaining the I.D. cards. Mayor De Blasio is optimistic. The city is a right to delete applicant documentation will be upheld in court.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
BILL DE BLASIO, NEW YORK CITY MAYOR: We are very confident in our position, our city law is abundantly clear, when unchallenged for two years it is quite clear about the timelines, and the methodology, and the need to protect people's confidentiality. And I think protection of confidentiality is very strong privacy rights are a very strong part of our law.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
LEE MILLER: New York's Deputy Commissioner for Counter Terrorism testified today that the City's Municipal I.D. are of little use to those who want to commit acts of terror. He told the court that terrorists recently arrested had in their possession more widely accepted forms of identification, Megyn.
KELLY: David Lee Miller, thank you. Naturally, right? Joining us now Guy Benson a Political Editor of Town Hall.com and a Fox News Contributor and Robert Zimmerman a Democratic Strategist.
GUY BENSON, TOWNHALL.COM: Good to be with you.
KELLY: Of course the terrorist could somehow they managed to get their hands on passports and driver's licenses, birth certificates that look like they are legit, but that doesn't answer the question about whether it's appropriate here, Guy for the city to start destroying the documentation that fills in the picture when it comes to these cards.
BENSON: Yes, I think this is the type of story, Megyn that causes millions of Americans to question the priorities of some of their elected officials. Not only of the city of New York handing out documentation to illegal immigrants. Which can be controversial unto itself, they are going out of their way to destroy the public record and wipe away the paper trail about who got these documents and how they got them. As we hear in that piece, this is not just about immigration. There are other issues at play. There are people getting official I.D.'s on their hands and access to the banking system and we are looking at potential fraud, money laundering and may be financing of terrorism. So to me this is a political agenda driving something that could put U.S. citizens and frankly everyone in the city at risk.
KELLY: What about it, Robert, you go down to the DMV and want to get a license. You basically have to give blood now or I mean you got to promise me your firstborn. It is like they can retrieve everything and it all becomes public record, where you live, all of it. Why should people who are actual citizens be subjected to that and people who are undocumented be able to just erase all of the supporting documentation supporting that card?
ROBERT ZIMMERMAN, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST: That is not the case. In fact, in the city of New York, this program is done under the offices of counterterrorism. And also under the offices of the New York police department that in fact approves of this program, because the documents are not the story. Let's be clear. The city keeps the permanent record of every individual's application who asks for a city I.D. and their most recent photograph. The types of documents that are destroyed are the personal data.
Maybe it involves an old passport, maybe old financial information, issues around that. But I think what really the danger to our security is, what really is a threat to our country is when we drive these people who are here, granted they are here undocumented citizens, we drive them into the shadows and we don't know where they are. Because of President-Elect Trumps rhetoric, threatening mass deportations, even threatening to report citizens who are here legally, because their parents are illegal, because of that kind rhetoric people are hiding. And that is what we don't know who is here in our country.
BENSON: Donald Trump, I'm not all it's been a huge fan of his, but he has been very clear especially since he was a elected that the priority will be criminal aliens who came here illegally and also committed additional crimes.
KELLY: He has made throw away comments that they all have to go.
BENSON: He has throughout the campaign. So there is ambiguity about, you know his official prediction.
KELLY: But what about Robert's point Guy, that it is not going to be, you are going to be able to get supporting documentation behind his I.D. cards, not just that identification.
BENSON: Not for the Feds and also the information will be destroyed, that will be destroyed pertains to how these people are able to get these I.D.'s in the first place. I think that is significant.
ZIMMERMAN: Guy that is entirely incorrect. They get their I.D.'s by applying pre-application and by being reviewed by the New York City police department. So they get it is a very scrutinizing process. Out of the million that receive it, only according to your report, only 100 have had face difficulties.
KELLY: I tell you what. If you don't like this program, under Mayor De Blasio, you may be in luck because he could possibly lose his position in the mayor's mansion and we will tell you in the next block why that is. Guy, Robert, great to see you.
BENSON: Great to be with you.
KELLY: Also tonight, new reports that Hillary Clinton could be about to run for office again. Can you put the two things together? Have you figured it out? Stay tuned, because Brian Kilmeade has the information. And we really want to talk about this, the viral video from a local cat shelter that is too great not to watch, Brian Kilmeade on the cats, right after the break.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
BRIAN KILMEADE, FOX AND FRIENDS SHOW HOST: Have you ever feel like you just keep going around and around in circles but you never get anywhere. Maybe it is time to adopt a foster cat. See I have a cat, I mean we are shooting a commercial.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
HILLARY CLINTON, PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Please never stop believing for finding what is right is the real question.
(APPLAUSE)
(END VIDEO CLIP)
KELLY: Developing tonight, a new report suggesting Hillary Clinton political fight may not be over. A Democratic official tells News Mac the former presidential candidate is being urge to launch a bid for mayor if New York City against incumbent Bill de Blasio and is quote, talking about it. Joining me now Brian Kilmeade, host of Kilmeade and friends on Fox News Radio and author of Thomas Jefferson and the Tripoli pirate, the hugely popular. Good to see you Brian.
KILMEADE: Great to see you, Megyn.
KELLY: She is back it, already?
KILMEADE: It is incredible.
KELLY: What do you mean?
KILMEADE: Not only that, according to the story the Clinton camp says if she stays viable and actually win, runs for mayor, she will probably win because Mayor De Blasio is underwater. He is not like. She doesn't really get up early, gets in around noon, works out some more and goes home. If she does run and win, and stays viable and the theory is that Trump implodes that she might be part of the nomination and get another shot.
KELLY: Come on.
KILMEADE: For Democrats, this would be sad. They got to stop it. I mean think about this, Bob Dole, when he lost, he left. John McCain, he lost, he left. For her to stick around and think like this kind of makes sense in that she is showing up to the inauguration, Megyn. She had a chance to dip into the background. She walks in the woods a lot with cameras around.
(LAUGHTER)
KELLY: You could say that is orchestrated. Those are natural bump that would make up free like oh, just being a normal citizen.
KILMEADE: Right. She is walking in the woods and people seem to spot her. We will find out. No, I do think this is something that she will not excel at but she might earn.
KELLY: DO you think she is going to be mayor of New York City? She was a senator of New York.
KILMEADE: For a woman with international acclaim and recognition to be mayor of New York City, I think would be a huge step down.
KELLY: Mayor Bloomberg, he had billions of dollars. He doesn't have to do it. There is a prestigious thing in being mayor of New York. This is fascinating so we will continue to watch as she quote talks about it. By the way she won 79 percent of the vote in the New York City during the presidential election. So her chances might look good. There is a new app, you know there are some people having difficulty on the left accepting Donald Trump in the election and those on the right think the left are crazy, so tell us about the App.
KILMEADE: Forty percent of the country, whether you are Democrat or Republican has no interest and can't be convinced that your position is something that is conceivable in fact, most of the country feels if you are a Democrat or Republican, the other party is doing things that would destroy the country. That hasn't stopped a 29-year-old Harvard Business School student. 29 stuck in Harvard, obviously getting up back a lot.
(LAUGHTER)
He came up created an app that allows people, it's called a high from the other side. To log on and actually interact with somebody from the other side, Republican or Democrat and say, hey I am pro-Hillary, hey I am pro Trump. Maybe you can explain your side of the story.
KELLY: That is sweet. That is kind of sweet. I don't know, it is like getting a dialogue going, some people, they've never met a Trump supporter, they have no idea who this people are, like yes, and actually they are normal people. They just want a different thing than you want.
KILMEADE: You are so optimistic and sunny and naive young lady. There is no way this will actually do anything to heal America, I don't know if you've walked outside the tower.
KELLY: You have no idea what a Pollyanna I am. I'm such a Pollyanna that I wanted to do this segment tonight about this guy and these cats. Watch.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: All of our cats are so cleaning and cleaning and cleaning -- and 2016 - models are compatible with windows so how long have you been waiting to get adopted? You like hungry cats? We've got some of the hungriest cats you've ever seen. Seriously take him to snug you. How did you get so small? You never stop eating. Our cats are so fantastic, and excited about going home with you. We are practically giving them away. You like black cats? We've got the blackest cats you've ever seen. You like big cats? We've got the biggest cats you've ever seen.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
KELLY: Oh. That is sweet.
KILMEADE: He is a contractor at a rental property management company, he assist the volunteers at that place for kids. I juts a have an idea, you are very funny, and you do a lot of videos, so do this for me, and then read it put it up. Now it's got million of views and goal is of course to get the cat homes, he is a mini star.
KELLY: The problem is they got some donations, but they're not getting the cats adopted. They still need help. Roughly 300 shelter resident there still all need home. It's called fur kids in Atlanta, an animal shelter. I would like a cat that high-fives on cue.
KILMEADE: I know. I would like to know somebody that high five on cue, can you get James to high five on cue. Here is the thing, how come Hammer gets to talk about politics and Trump. I get cat videos. What's going on? I need a new producer, agent, I need something.
KELLY: You can take it up with the new host.
KILMEADE: Really. I am not coming in next week. I'm not doing this show again. You are a superstar. It's been great to get to know you.
KELLY: You are not supposed to say, don't say anything, it always makes me cry.
KILMEADE: All right I won't say it again.
KELLY: Lots of love. We will be right back.
KELLY: New Year, and knew you, happy to report that my book ""Settle for more"" is inspiring a lot of folks. You could be one of them. DanielGirl calls it, one of the most well written, honest, inspiring books that I have ever read. Should be read by every person willing to step out and settle for more. Check it out and see you tomorrow, for our last hour together."

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
JAMES CLAPPER, DIRECTOR, NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE: I don't think that we have ever encountered a more aggressive campaign to interfere in our election process as we have seen in this case.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
O'REILLY: Again, today, American intelligence leaders say that Russia interfered in the presidential election. Do you believe that? ""Talking Points"" will analyze the evidence tonight. 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Smack his [bleep] smack his [bleep] again. [bleep] Donald Trump. [bleep] white people, boy.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
O'REILLY: One of the most horrific crimes ever in Chicago. A mentally disabled young man tortured, and now, the four individuals involved have been charged with hate crimes. We'll have the inside story.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
JESSE WATTERS, WATTERS' WORLD HOST: Are those processed meats?
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes.
WATTERS: Well, do you want diabetes?
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Well, you have to die of something.
WATTERS: (LAUGHTER)
(END VIDEO CLIP)
O'REILLY: Also, I heard Americans love their snacks. But are they hurting us?
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: Do you know how much sodium is in something like that?
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I don't know and I don't care. I'm hungry.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
O'REILLY: Caution. You are about to enter the ""No Spin Zone."" ""The Factor"" begins right now. Hi, I'm Bill O'Reilly. Thanks for watching us tonight. Putin, Trump, and the election. That is the subject of this evening's ""Talking Points"" memo. Today in Washington, the senate armed services committee held hearings about Russia allegedly subverting the presidential election. Front and center was director of National Intelligence, James Clapper.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
CLAPPER: The Russians have a long history of interfering in elections. Theirs and other people's. But I don't think that we've ever encountered a more aggressive or direct campaign to interfere in our election process than we have seen in this case.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
O'REILLY: Of course, it's all about hacking into the democratic and national committee, and some of the democratic leaders. ""Talking Points"" believes Mr. Clapper, however, because there's no reason to doubt him. There's no reason to doubt the man. Now, there has been no definitive proof put forth that the Russian leader, Vladimir Putin did try to interfere with our vote.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
CLAPPER: We have invested billions and we put people's lives at risk to glean such information. And so, if we were to fulsomely expose it in such a way that would be completely persuasive to everyone, then, we can just kiss that off, because we'll lose it.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
CLAPPER: Mr. Clapper is saying he cannot expose his sources or explain how he got the USA - how the USA got the information about the Russian hacking. So, this becomes a very complicated matter because some democrats are charging that the hack of democratic stalwarts like John Podesta influenced the voting. Republicans say, ""Nonsense,"" that the exposed email simply pointed out political intrigue and pressed corruption. It's impossible to say, if any votes were influenced by Podesta's rantings, but it seems far-fetched to me. Despite the intel consensus, President-elect Trump is not accepting of the verdict against Putin. Now, Mr. Trump will be briefed tomorrow by intelligence leaders, and maybe that will change. But for you and me, Americans who sincerely want fair elections and justice, the hacking should be a serious matter. Again, ""Talking Points"" believes the Russians were involved with the intent to create as much chaos as possible for America. And nothing happens in Russia at that level unless Putin approves. But Putin is not holding a smoking gun because US Intelligence has to protect its sources or information. Summing up, the Russians did it. Putin knew about it. And President-elect Trump has to decide a further action against Russia is necessary. And that's the memo. Now for the Top Story reactions, joining us from Washington, Morgan Wright, a cybersecurity analyst. And Lt. Col. Ralph Peters, Strategic Analyst at Fox News. So am I making any mistakes here, colonel?
LT. COL. RALPH PETERS, FOX STRATEGIC ANALYST: No Bill. You and I are on the same sheet of music overall on this. I think it's - what's really important here is not to argue in a partisan manner. This was an attack upon the fundamental tool of our democracy, free elections. The response has to be bipartisan, not democrat, not republican, not about throwing the election one way or the other, but about an attack on our nation.
O'REILLY: But some people don't believe it, you know. Some people don't believe that Putin and the Russians did it. You heard Assange tell Sean Hannity this week that that didn't happen. And there were some in congress who don't believe it. That's what muddies the waters. I believe it, you believe it. And I think, Mr. Wright, you you believe it, correct?
MORGAN WRIGHT, CYBERSECURITY ANALYST: The world is not flat.
O'REILLY: No, I got it. But when you have so much confusion, it's very hard to get a consensus or to get people mobilized. What do you say, Mr. Wright?
WRIGHT: You know, Bill, this is an ongoing discussion we have been having for a long time. And one of the big things that came out of this hearing, it's pretty clear, we are very bad on defense. We've got good offense, we've got the NSA, we've got a lot of the capability. But until we raise the price of an attack to where it becomes so high in time, logistics, money, expense on their part, Bill, we'll keep having the same conversations over and over again, because you know why? Because there is no deterrent effect. That was very clear in the hearing today. Russia's doing it, China's doing it, but they're not paying a high enough price, and until we raise the bar on that, you and I, and Ralph Peters and I, will keep having these same discussions.
O'REILLY: What would you say, though, Mr. Wright, to Americans who simply are not convinced that Russia and Putin interfered and hacked into the election process? What would you say to them?
WRIGHT: You know, you're not going to be able to convince everybody, but I think at this point, when the director, James Clapper, said there is high confidence, the same thing James Comey said about North Korea, and we definitively proved North Korea was involved in the Sony hack. At some point, you have to trust the intelligence professionals. I think the problem, Bill, is a lot of this has become politicized. We politicized the intelligence process to the point of where it doesn't serve policy objectives anymore, it's serving political objectives.
O'REILLY: Yes, there are people who are suspicious of Clapper and suspicious of Comey, and think that they are trying to help the democrats, because the democratic mantra right now, Col. Peters, is that this Russian hack through the election to Trump. That's what you're hearing from a lot of democrats. And republicans are furious about that.
PETERS: I don't want to hear about democrats and republicans. I want to hear about the United States of America. We were attacked, cynically and viciously. You know, Bill, you got to look it in terms of cost-benefit analysis. This was really cheap. It was a dirty cheap way for Putin to wage war upon our system. And he knew.
O'REILLY: But why would Putin want, you know, I made this point on my talk today to the billoreilly.com premium people in the ""No Spin"" news. Why would Putin want Trump over Clinton? The democrats are much least confrontational, colonel, than the republicans are. Now you have Mattis as secretary of defense, that can't make Putin happy. That can't. Go ahead.
PETERS: Well, let me ask you and everyone a question. Why does Donald Trump continue to defend Vladimir Putin no matter what Putin does?
O'REILLY: I can answer that question. Because he wasnts --
PETERS: Well, let me tell you. Let me answer the question, Bill.
O'REILLY: All right. Well, you asked me but you want to answer it. OK. Go, go.
PETERS: Yes, you know, look, Hillary Clinton was on to Putin, and then he didn't want her in. Now, whether or not it influenced the election, I'm not interested in that. What I am interested in are two questions. You know, how are we going to respond and two, will the President-elect finally wise up and realize that in fact, Putin is not our friend, he's our enemy. He is bent upon doing as much damage as what he thinks is possible.
O'REILLY: All right. But I think that what Trump wants to do is neutralize Putin as an enemy. But we'll find out tomorrow, because tomorrow, Mr. Wright, the intel people go to New York - come here to New York, they talk to Trump face to face, they will tell him and show him the evidence because it's top-secret and all that. We can see it. But certainly, President-elect Trump will see it. So, his reaction after that briefing will probably mean everything. But to answer the Colonel's question. Trump wants to start on a neutral basis with Putin to try to deemphasize that tension. Now, I'm going to say one more thing. How bad is, Mr. wright, because you are an expert in this. How about is our defense system against hackers in China and Russia, and anywhere else? How bad is our defense system right now?
WRIGHT: We are getting blown out of the game 100 to nothing right now. I mean, when you have, for example, they talked about the OPM hack, 22 million files, of which mine was one of mine, I know Col. Peters was one of those. There is no accountability for that. I understand we won't retaliate based on traditional espionage. But we could have prevented that through solid defense. There was a standing order from 2007 that says all data at rest must be encrypted. Bill those systems at OPM were so old --
O'REILLY: What's OPM, could you explain that to people, OPM is what?
WRIGHT: The Office of Personnel and Management. Up until just recently, they were responsible for processing and holding all of the applications for security clearances, which contains a lot of sensible information that the Chinese have it.
O'REILLY: And they got hacked into by? Who hacked them?
WRIGHT: By China. China did.
O'REILLY: They got all the information, and we didn't do anything, President Obama didn't do anything to China. Now was it proven beyond a reasonable doubt that China did it?
WRIGHT: Absolutely. Director Clapper, in the same way he came and talked about Russia, said, ""It's no doubt China did it.""
O'REILLY: Right.
WRIGHT: But, Bill, we could have stopped a lot of this with a modern infrastructure. Donald Trump wants to spend money on roads and bridges, a trillion dollars, we should take 100 billion out of that and improve our aging IT infrastructure because our power grid, our utilities, our banking, everything is at risk now. This is a new type of warfare. We are not ready.
O'REILLY: All right. And I think that's the crux of this whole story. We are not ready for this, and we got to get ready for it. Gentlemen, thank you very much. next on the rundown. A split in the democratic party. Someone to give Donald Trump a chance. Others want to destroy him immediately. We'll have a special report. Later, Watters talks snacking with the folks.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: Do you know how many transfats are in that thing?
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I don't really care.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
O'REILLY: Those reports after these messages.
O'REILLY: Impact Segment. Tonight, a split in the democratic party. Some dems are setting themselves up as loyal opposition.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
LEO RYAN, CONGRESSMAN: I fought really hard for Donald Trump not to be president, but I think you got to sit and listen to what he says, and hear what he has to say and read his plans. We owe it to the American people who voted for this man to become president to at least look at those. And if they are not what we want, then, we fight like hell.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
O'REILLY: Congressman Ryan representing the moderate wing of his party. But the radical wing wants to destroy Donald Trump before he even gets into office. Yesterday, a full-page ad in ""The New York Times"" called the country a potential fascist state, and urge the resistance to President-elect Trump. Some of those signing the ad, the actors Michael Shannon and Debra Messing, and Ed Aznar, also, Rosie O'Donnell. Joining us now here in New York City, two other men who signed the ad, Carl Dix, founding member of The Revolutionary Communist Party, USA. And Dr. Cornell West, professor at Harvard University. So, Dr. West, I've known you a long time, and you're not willing to give Trump a chance? You don't want to see him maybe for six months and see what he does? You're not willing to do that?
CORNELL WEST, PROFESSOR, HARVARD UNIVERSITY: I'm just afraid of the danger and the damage that he has already talked about. And we talk about fascist, we're not talking about just an isolated individual as president. We're talking about a strong man, a narcissistic personality, tied to big business, tied to big military, possibility of war, and slices of big media, because we know money itself plays a fundamental role in corporate media, that allows him to too often get away with not enough accountability.
O'REILLY: Well, why don't you - all right. I mean, that's your point of view. You are worried about it.
WEST: Well, that's not point of view. I think it's the matter of truth to what's true and not true.
O'REILLY: But if it were true, then he wouldn't have been elected. So you're saying there's a lot of people --
WEST: No, no, I'm (inaudible) for brother, Carl. The popularist will vote for a fascist (inaudible)
(CROSSTALK)
O'REILLY: (inaudible)
WEST: Why not give him a chance to see what he will do? For a few months, anyway. Why not do that?
CARL DIX, FOUNDING MEMBER OF THE REVOLUTIONARY COMMUNIST PARTY, USA: People gave Hitler a chance, and we saw what that meant for humanity. And with Donald Trump, look at what we are talking about. Muslim registry, wall on the border with Mexico. Law and order, which is code word for unleashing harsher repression against Black and Latino people. Also, a disregard for descent and civil liberties. I mean, people who burned the flag, which is protected political speech, going to jail and losing their citizenship. His opponent in the election being threatened with jail. Reporters who were critical of him having to hire security. This is not only a program that's fascist, but an approach that will suffocate the society to oppose those.
O'REILLY: But again, all of those things --
(CROSSTALK)
DIX: (inaudible) stop this regime before it even started.
O'REILLY: Wait. You had a chance. Yes, you had a chance to stop it on election day, and it didn't work out in your way. So, to me, I want everybody to be fair, fair. All right. I don't think you have any historical context to compare Donald Trump to Hitler. I mean, Hitler had a record from 1927 on of violence.
DIX: So does Donald Trump.
O'REILLY: No, he hasn't had anything for violence.
DIX: What about the full-page ad calling for the execution of the Central Park Five that he did in 1990.
O'REILLY: That is.
(CROSSTALK)
DIX: Those were five young men who were framed. That we still think should be in (inaudible)
O'REILLY: OK. That is rhetoric. Not violence.
DIX: This man is (inaudible)
O'REILLY: Look, you have to go on what happens, not as what is being said. Look, you're a communist, right? All right. You're a communist.
DIX: Yes, I'm a representative of the Revolutionary Communist Party. I tell people that.
O'REILLY: Right. But I don't condemn you because you are a communist. I don't do that. I wait and see what you, Mr. Dix do. What do you do? Now, you're philosopher. Stalin was a communist.
DIX: What I'm doing right now is calling on people.
O'REILLY: You're calling on people to do what?
DIX: To come out into the streets, to manifest their anguish, fear, and outrage.
O'REILLY: All right. And what are they going to Do in the streets? What do you want them to do?
DIX: Protest.
O'REILLY: OK. In what way?
DIX: Nonviolent disobedience.
O'REILLY: The nonviolent? Just with signs and stuff?
DIX: Church congregations to do vigils with candles. And whatever form (inaudible)
O'REILLY: So that's what you both want? You want a mass.
(CROSSTALK)
DIX: (inaudible) display?
O'REILLY: A mass display.
WEST: We want a moral, spiritual awakening that focuses on poor and working people, on women, on Mexicans, on Muslims, those who have been alienated by Trump (inaudible)
O'REILLY: And if that is not materialized --
(CROSSTALK)
WEST: On undocumented immigrants, we will defend them. We will defend the women when it comes to closing down the place. We will defend those who are --
O'REILLY: If your version does not materialize, which I don't think it's going to.
DIX: Yeah, we'll see if it materializes.
O'REILLY: All right. But if it doesn't, then what's the next step?
WEST: We continue to struggle.
O'REILLY: To struggle for what?
WEST: For truth and justice.
O'REILLY: OK. So you come on programs like this, and you give your opinion. That's fine. But is there any other element?
WEST: But it's not just opinion though. There are people suffering, working people are suffering, poor people are suffering, women are suffering, Black people are suffering, brown people.
O'REILLY: Yes, but Trump has promised to bring more jobs to alleviate the suffering.
WEST: He already betrayed working people by brining Wall Street and the business Goldman Sachs.
O'REILLY: All right. But that's just rhetoric, come on.
DIX: That's not a rhetoric.
(CROSSTALK)
O'REILLY: Go ahead.
DIX: He promised the jobs that hasn't materialized yet, but a promise of jobs --
O'REILLY: he's not president yet.
DIX: Does not excuse embracing a Muslim registry. A border wall.
O'REILLY: Well, let's see if the Muslim registry happen.
DIX: Bragging about sexual assault.
O'REILLY: Oh, stop.
DIX: (inaudible) a lynch mob atmosphere.
(CROSSTALK)
O'REILLY: You can do that to any human being.
DIX: (inaudible) we should lay out these protesters. In the old days (inaudible)
O'REILLY: All right. I think you're both being unfair.
WEST: Unfair with who?
(CROSSTALK)
O'REILLY: You got to see what he does in office. What he does.
WEST: But he's already talked about it.
O'REILLY: It doesn't matter what he says.
DIX: You do history, Bill.
O'REILLY: Unfair.
DIX: You're not actually (inaudible)
(CROSSTALK)
WEST: What about his personnel? What about personnel? (inaudible)
(CROSSTALK)
DIX: If people in Germany have done what they did (inaudible) Hitler.
O'REILLY: Don't give me Germany. I hear a communist crew filled with just many (inaudible) in the Soviet Union.
DIX: First of all, that is not correct.
WEST: (inaudible) we don't need to get into the (inaudible)
(CROSSTALK)
O'REILLY: I got to get out of here.
(CROSSTALK)
O'REILLY: You guys aren't being fair. But let's talk about the reality, and the reality is you aren't being fair. No. OK. We gave you your (inaudible)
(CROSSTALK)
O'REILLY: You got to watch and see what he does. We'll see. And you don't give fascist (inaudible) label anybody that.
(CROSSTALK)
WEST: When we return, three months from now --
O'REILLY: We'll see. We'll see. Got to go. Got to go.
WEST: Then we'll see. Then we'll see.
O'REILLY: One of the worst crimes we have ever seen. Mentally challenged individual tortured. Four young people in Chicago (inaudible) as the inside story on that. And later, republican house panel recommending cutting off all funding for planned parenthood, partially because of the selling baby parts situation. ""The Factor"" is coming right back.
O'REILLY: Truth Serum segment tonight. Very disturbing situation out of Chicago, a viewer warning here. Police have charged four young people, two men, two women with torturing a mentally challenged individual. Also, the four will face hate crime charges.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: At one point, the victim is held at knife point and told to curse President-elect Donald Trump. The men can be heard saying they want this to go viral. Another video shows the group forcing the victim to drink water from a toilet. Throughout these videos, the victim is kicked, hit, and cut.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
O'REILLY: With us now, our Truth Serum correspondent here in New York. And Shannon Bream in Washington. So, Shannon, just give us the timeline on this story. How did it develop and how did it end?
SHANNON BREAM, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDNT: It started on New Year's Eve. Apparently, the victim's parents took him to meet the main guy in this thing, Jordan Hill, the main suspect at a McDonald's. They were going to spend time together for New Year's Eve. They had apparently gone to school together today, and police said they were acquaintances, they didn't hang out a lot. But they had spend some time together. So, Jordan Hill, then, takes this kid in a van that is stolen, the kid apparently doesn't know that it is stolen, and they spent a couple of days, riding around, having fun, sleeping in the van, seeing people. But it took a really bad turn when they decided to go visit some friends on the west side of Chicago. There were these two sisters, there was another guy there. So, now, two guys, two girls. And at one point, they are play fighting, and it escalates. You know, police said they think that these people who were involved here were possibly smoking marijuana, it looks like they may have been in the video. But it really escalates, it gets violent. It winds up with his kid who has some type of special needs, some mental challenge, being tied up, in a corner. They're facebooking this. The video is out there. They are taunting him. You heard about the things they're forcing him to do, the things they're saying to him. They are beating him, they are cutting him at one point, and he's bleeding. What happens is somebody downstairs hears this and goes up and says, ""If you guys don't knock off all the noise, I'm calling the police."" Well, the two girls got so incensed by that, they ran downstairs, they kicked in that neighbor's door, the police showed up, and that gave this kid a chance to run off. So, he is then discovered on the side of the road, his parents had reported him missing, not initially, because they thought he was going to spend the night with his kid, but after a couple of days, they did. And a police officer sees him battered, beaten up, walking around in shorts in the freezing cold, takes him in for some help. They put two and two together. And parents were (inaudible)
O'REILLY: And that happens. OK. How old was the victim?
BREAM: Eighteen years old.
O'REILLY: He's 18, okay. So, then they have a press conference today, and then these four are charged with all kinds of stuff, they're all going to do hard time. But the question is, why would you put this on Facebook, you know you're going to get caught if you do that. And the answer, the authorities say, they don't know. I guess, they haven't questioned them.
BREAM: And especially if you could hear one of the guys on the video is saying, ""We want this to go viral."" I mean, one of the police officials who was speaking today said, ""I can't "" - when he was asked why they would do this, he said, ""I don't understand why anyone would post these kinds of things on Facebook."" He seems baffled, too. But now we're talking about multiple felony counts for all these kids ranking anywhere from 40 to 60 years behind bars. If convicted.
O'REILLY: Yes. And they will be convicted. And President of the United States labeled this act despicable, and it is. It's a disgrace that this would happen in America, and they should get the most severe sentences that the system has. All right, Shannon.
BREAM: Yes, we'll track it.
O'REILLY: Thank you. All right. Now, we have another story, and this one is in far away, Kazakhstan but it's about Putin. So, Eric Shawn, there was a guy in a Kazakhstan which is a former part of the Soviet Union and still close ties, all right. Who criticized Putin. What did he do?
ERIC SHAWN, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: Yes, his name was Sanat Dosov, he's 46 years old, and according to the reports, he went on Facebook and shared articles that called Putin a fascist, a terrorist, ruining Russia, called him the enemy. (inaudible) there's a meme that he reportedly shared that had Putin's face with Stalin and Lenin and in Kazakhstan, it is against the law to quote and site social disorder or national hatred. So, he gets charged with that. And he pleads, and they're appealing, but he gets three years in the slammer.
O'REILLY: He gets three years.
SHAWN: Three years.
O'REILLY: So, at Facebook again, he puts all of the stuff, anti-Putin stuff on the Facebook page, it goes out, and the law in Kazakhstan says you can't do what again?
SHAWN: You can't incite social or national generic racial class or religious hatred. You can't insult national honor and the dignity of religious feelings based on class or national (inaudible)
O'REILLY: But this is - Putin is in Russia, this isn't even in his own country.
SHAWN: Well, it doesn't matter, they're close to Russia. And guess what, the media in Kazakhstan, they can't report this because under the law, you can't report politically sensitive topics. You couldn't - you get life.
O'REILLY: Yes, I know. I'd be executed then. But not only there, in many other countries, as well. So, this guy is going up for three, for saying these stuff about Putin. Not even in Russia. Imagine if he did it in Russia. He wouldn't be doing maybe out in Siberia for 30. But this is very interesting. So these countries, former Soviet Union satellites, there is no freedom of speech. This basically takes away all your freedom of speech.
SHAWN: They have one of the lowest levels of freedom of the press in Kazakhstan in the world. They're 161 out of 180.
O'REILLY: OK. So we won't be going there anytime soon. There will not be a Kazakhstan factor. All right, Eric. Thank you. Plenty more as ""The Factor"" moves along this evening, Bernie Goldberg says there's now Trump Derangement Syndrome sweeping the country. He'll explain. On ""Watters' World,"" the snack addition.

WATTERS: You had a Philly cheese steak and those fries smothered with that stuff?
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes, yes, I did. It's my cheat day today, so.
WATTERS: That's a big day. I'm feeling every day is your cheat day.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
O'REILLY: I hope you stay tuned for those reports.
O'REILLY: Back to follow-up segment tonight. A House panel formed by Republicans has investigated the undercover video that showed Planned Parenthood admitting to selling the body parts of aborted babies.
The conclusion of the panel in a 471 page report is that Planned Parenthood should lose federal funding for a variety of reasons. Now that's no surprise as most Republicans abhor that organization. For the record, Planned Parenthood receives about $450 million in taxpayer money each year.
Joining us now from Los Angeles, Leslie Marshall. I am not sure whether President-elect Trump is going to pursue this. But if he does, Planned Parenthood maybe in big trouble financially, Leslie, right?
LESLIE MARSHALL, RADIO TALK SHOW HOST: Oh, absolutely, without question. But it goes beyond that, Bill. I mean, first of all, I would agree, I'm not sure that President-elect Donald Trump would pursue this because he's been on different sides of the issues regarding Planned Parenthood in the campaign. But as you have pointed out, it's not always what he says, it is what he is going to do, you've said in the past.
Look, when we look at Planned Parenthood, I think there's a huge misconception by many on the right. I think that they have the idea that if you defund the Planned Parenthood, the number of abortions is going to be reduced or abortion is going to be gone altogether. Planned Parenthood is not the only --
O'REILLY: No, I don't think so. No. What the beef is, Leslie --
(CROSSTALK)
MARSHALL: -- why they have the effort?
O'REILLY: The beef is that by funding Planned Parenthood to the tune of $450 million, people who don't believe in abortion, who believe it is taking of a human life, are then, forced to participate in abortion, because that money goes to Planned Parenthood, which performs, or makes possible, about 350,000 abortions each year. So, it's more of a -- look, abortion is legal in the USA, but I don't want to pay for it. And I shouldn't be forced to pay for it. That's the beef.
MARSHALL: But we also know, Bill, that they cannot use that money for the abortions. We also know that --
O'REILLY: It doesn't matter, though.
MARSHALL: -- Planned Parenthood has performed 9 million services, of which over 300,000 are abortions.
O'REILLY: That doesn't matter, either. They can't use the money --
MARSHALL: But it does, Bill. It does, because the money is --
O'REILLY: No, no, no, it doesn't. They can't use the money directly, but they get the referrals. Look, I mean, the stats are unbelievable that for every 20 abortions Planned Parenthood sets up, there's one adoption. I mean, it's 20 to one. And so, everybody knows this is an abortion.
If you're looking for an abortion, Planned Parenthood is a primary place to go. And so that is the beef. But why don't you make a prediction? Is Donald Trump going to get into this brawl, because if he doesn't get into it, it's not going to go anywhere? If he does, then, legislation to defund will absolutely come up. Is he going to do it?
MARSHALL: I think, yes, because as you know, the origin of the Republicans saying we're going to defund ObamaCare, by the way, we're going to defund Planned Parenthood on the heels of that.
O'REILLY: You think he will, even though it's --
(CROSSTALK)
O'REILLY: -- and, you know, he'd be demonized as anti-woman, you know it's going to happen if he does. You think he still will?
MARSHALL: Bill, he -- Bill, let's be honest. This president-elect by many, especially, in my side of the aisle was already been demonized by women. And that's the problem here, Bill. If you have -- if you're taking away health care and then you're taking away this clinic, where do women go for those other services? Where do they go --
O'REILLY: Well, let me answer that question. Number one --
MARSHALL: Where did they go for ovarian cancer, cervical cancer screening, the prenatal care, education?
O'REILLY: Leslie, let me answer that question. Let me answer that question. Number one, if ObamaCare is rescinded, the Republicans are going to have to put something in its place, OK. That has to happen. Number two, private donations can fund Planned Parenthood, OK? Private donations.
The organization doesn't have to have federal money. If all the true believers like yourself, all the Democrats, all the liberals who believe in abortion, if they want Planned Parenthood around, certainly, their donations will make it possible. Wouldn't they?
MARSHALL: Well, first of all, I believe in choice, not abortion. That's not a choice that I would make. But I believe you have the choice to do what you want with your body, whether you're a man or a woman. But I do want to --
O'REILLY: You can fund it. With your tax deduction, you can fund Planned Parenthood if that's what it's about. Nobody is saying close it down --
MARSHALL: But it's not just about that.
O'REILLY: All right.
MARSHALL: I feel like tax dollars should go toward helping for the 9 million services of which the overwhelming majority were not abortion services that women need, especially lower income women in America.
O'REILLY: Leslie, thank you. When we come right back, Bernie Goldberg on Trump Derangement Syndrome. Then, Watters on snacking America. Look at that. I hope he paid for that. Upcoming.
O'REILLY: Thanks for staying with us. I'm Bill O'Reilly. In the weekdays with Bernie segment tonight, Trump Derangement Syndrome, Bernie says it's an epidemic right now. He joins us from Miami.
So we had Bush Derangement Syndrome. We had Obama Derangement Syndrome, too. Is this worse, the Trump deal?
BERNIE GOLDBERG, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: It is. It is. And I will document this in just a moment. But it's even worse than cancer. I'll document that. Trump Derangement Syndrome has people believing that Donald Trump is Hitler. Just a few minutes ago on this program, you had several people who thought he was Hitler.
O'REILLY: Right.
GOLDBERG: You have intellectuals with Trump Derangement Syndrome writing an important newspapers and other publications that Donald Trump will jeopardize American democracy and actually, jeopardize American civilizations.
On college campuses, you have snowflakes with Trump Derangement Syndrome, who after he won, held a cry-in at one university and they have therapeutic puppies to get over their trauma and other universities.
And here's where the cancer comes in. There was a letter published in the ""Miami Herald,"" the letter to the editor by a woman who is 90-year-old mother whose name was Ruth is a holocaust survivor and is currently battling cancer.
I am going to read you a very, very short segment. She says, ""Today in her beloved America, Ruth seized the same warning sign that she saw in Nazi Germany. Anti-semitism, criticism of the free press, curtailed freedom of expression, religious slurs, overt racism, talk of punishing people for who they are, and not what they believe. OK. The thought of a president who (inaudible) and legitimizes these dangerous trends is more terrifying to her than the cancer she is battling."" So, to people with Trump Derangement Syndrome, Donald Trump is more terrifying than cancer.
O'REILLY: How does this happen? I don't know anybody that irrational. I mean, I have guests that are, but I don't know them in my personal life. I really don't tend to deal with hysterical people. I just don't have time to deal with it. But how do you think individuals like Brother West and the communist guy? I mean, they are convinced that, you know, the S.S. is going to be formed in the next two months when --
GOLDBERG: Yeah.
O'REILLY: -- rational people know that's not going to happen.
GOLDBERG: But there are rational people who know that, Bill. You're absolutely right. But there are other people who are otherwise intelligent. We're not talking about, like, crazy people here. There are people who have, you know, advanced college degrees who really believe this crazy stuff.
I mean, Donald Trump has gotten into their head in a way. Well, George Bush did, too. Let's, you know, as you mentioned, George Bush got into their head so that the mere mention of his name, you know, that they would start to foam at their mouth and some places. You know, their eyes were rolled around in their head. It's sort of the same except its worse. I mean, Donald Trump drives them crazy.
And for the record, you know this, but for the two or three people who don't know this, I am no fan of Donald Trump. I think he's unpresidential and there are way, way too many examples. We need of several hours --
(CROSSTALK)
O'REILLY: All right. But you're willing to give him a chance, right?
GOLDBERG: But I'm -- not only am I willing to give him a chance, absolutely. But people with Trump Derangement Syndrome, they are ironically bringing me closer to Donald Trump because they are far more -- I know -- they are far more annoying than he is.
O'REILLY: I don't know if the word annoying is strong enough. I think they're dangerous, you know. If you're not going to respect the electoral process in our country, and I don't mind them demonstrating that they don't like this policy or that policy, or even Trump, the guy. I don't mind that.
But if you're basically going to say, look, we're not going to accept the vote of the American people. We're not going to accept the Electoral College, that's dangerous. All right, that leads to anarchy.
GOLDBERG: It is. And it's sort of been legitimized that crazy thinking, because articles that say that are published, you know, not in ""MAD"" magazine or something or some crazy website.
I've read articles like this in ""The New York Times."" You know, columns in ""The New York Times"" were scholars from major, elite universities write what I consider really crazy stuff about, you know, what's going to happen to America with Donald Trump. So, they legitimize it. They legitimize the craziness.
O'REILLY: There's a lot of hysteria, no doubt about it. Bernie Goldberg. Everybody, Watters is on deck. We Americans love our snacks, but are they harming us? ""Watters' World,"" moments away.
O'REILLY: Back in the book segment tonight, ""Watters' World,"" it is estimated that Americans spend nearly $300 billion every year on fast foods and snacks. And some of that stuff is really bad for us. So we sent Watters out to a food court in West Nyack, New York to sample opinion.

WATTERS: How do you feel now?
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Not good.
WATTERS: What have you already eaten?
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: A burger.
WATTERS: You smoke that burger like it was your last meal on earth. You want to know why? Because there's additives in there that make it addictive.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (Inaudible), I'm going to get you the cheeseburger from. How do you like it, medium?

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I'm sorry?
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Set up.
WATTERS: I can smell the heart disease.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Can you taste the heart disease, too?
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'm a big fan of Bill O'Reilly. And you're a fan, too.
WATTERS: You have great taste in T.V., not food.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: If I give you 10 bucks, would you go wait in your car?
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: As soon as we find out you're going to be on, it's definitely that we're going to watch.
WATTERS: You know what, eat all the food you want, you have great taste. Thank you. Oh, let me get a bite of this.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: That boy is a P-I-G, pig.

O'REILLY: Watters is here. Boy, you are the Mr. Brighten Guy, you know. Can't the folks have a little snack?
WATTERS: I was not fat shaming. I was snack shaming.
O'REILLY: Yeah.
WATTERS: And I was looking out for them. I wanted them to be healthy.
O'REILLY: You need snack, though. You do that.
WATTERS: What do I eat, Bill? You don't know what I eat.
O'REILLY: Yes, I do. I see you going around the corn dogs or whatever.
WATTERS: I've never eaten a corn dog in my life.
O'REILLY: Come one. Oh, yeah. Now, Watters, in some mysterious universal screw up now has a weekly show on FNC every Saturday night.

WATTERS: That's right.
O'REILLY: Now, the first show is this coming Saturday.
WATTERS: Yes, it is.
O'REILLY: And you got an ambush to the people who annoyed Ivanka Trump.
WATTERS: Yes. We caught up with one of the guys and we have little clipped here if you take a look.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: You harassed a woman with her baby on flight. Are you proud of that? Real class act, aren't you? Now you're afraid to show your face?
(END VIDEO CLIP)
O'REILLY: Where was that?
WATTERS: In Brooklyn.
O'REILLY: Brooklyn?
WATTERS: Yeah.
O'REILLY: And the guy just -- they're all the same.
WATTERS: Such cowards.
O'REILLY: Yeah, they're all the same. They do the stuff and then they want to, you know, explain why they did it or whatever they got it. All right, so, everybody's going to watch Watters on Saturday night at 8:00 p.m.
WATTERS: Yup.
O'REILLY: All right, we'll see you. Back with the tip of the day, why some people who use to want to come on the ""The Factor"" no longer do. The tip, moments away.
O'REILLY: Back to tip of the day, some gas (ph) are fleeing us in a moment. First, a bullet for billoreilly.com premium members, now you guys get double discounts on all my books, all our merchandise, so stock up. Pricing is amazing on the website and become a premium member. It's worth it.
Now the mail, Paul Hickman, Chicago. ""Our murder problems are not the governor's fault. It's on the mayor and Democrats who run the city. Sorry, Paul. Governor Rauner is MIA on a murder deal and he's the most powerful politician in the state, so come on.
It's Vincelli Joy (ph), Boca Raton of Florida. ""The people running Chicago and San Francisco were elected. Hint to O'Reilly: folks get the government they deserve."" No one is an American deserves to be gunned down on the street, Vince, come on.
Stephen Ortell (ph), Redondo Beach, Florida -- California, I should say. Redondo is in California. ""Bill, you're Talking Points regarding the murders in Chicago was accurate and thoughtful. Unfortunately, the people who run that city want to make it all about gun control."" Yep.
Judy Propait (ph), Castaic, California. ""O'Reilly, I am outraged. I have never heard of the new law that legalizes children to commit prostitution. The media largely ignored it here.""
Bernard Silverstein, New Braunfels, Texas. ""Bill, forget your partisan diatribes. Does it seem remotely logical that a former theology student like Jerry Brown would support child prostitution? You are totally misreading the law."" That's false, Bernard. That is false. Our report was totally accurate.
Bernard Peratt (ph), St. David, Arizona. ""California authorities can arrest adults who use children under the pedophilia laws."" That's true. But the case is will be much more difficult to make without the child's testimony. You can't hold the kids in for being prostitutes. So, who's going to testify against the pedophile?
Paul Ambrosius (ph), Lancaster, California. ""O'Reilly, please tell me how to stop my taxes from paying Eric Holder to defend sanctuary cities?"" Move the taxes, Paul. There's no way you can stop the madness. The California legislator has decided to pay the former attorney general and his law firm $300,000 taxpayers a year.
Bill Brown, Fullerton, California. ""Love Killing the Rising Sun and now understand why my father would never talk about the war. Has the book been translated into Japanese? They need to know the truth."" I don't know if, Hope (ph), my publisher will take the book into the Japanese market, Bill. It's not exactly easy reading for those guys over there.
Sue Burgwell, Broken Arrow, Oklahoma. ""Bill my husband passed away last July, one month after our 46th wedding anniversary. His birthday was January 13 so I bought tickets to see you, Miller and Jesse in Tulsa that night because we watched you all the time."" What a nice thing to do, Sue. And I'm going to make sure that the Tulsa show one week from tomorrow is excellent.
Details on billoreilly.com. Also a few tickets remain for Omaha and (inaudible).
Finally, very happy birthday to Peg Sterns (ph) in Massachusetts, she's 106 today. Way to go Peg. She's not eating in that fast food, I don't know. Maybe she is. My grandma ate at fast food and died at 97 and she was like twinkie heaven (inaudible) thing.
All right, finally, ""The Factor"" tip of the day. The old cliche (ph) as politics make strange bed fellows. And now because of the election of Donald Trump, bed fellows are all over the place. Here's an example.
Yesterday, ""The Factor"" invited Republican Senator Lindsey Graham on to talk about foreign policy and the hack, because he is an expert. Now in the past, Senator Graham was very polite to us and often appeared here. But yesterday ignored this completely and showed up on CNN. Oh, it's all because of Donald Trump.
Senator Graham doesn't want to answer questions about him, and therefore goes to the venues. He believes he can control. We've seen this with a number of Republicans, interesting phenomenon. So here is the tip. It's coming to you. We'll see one of the strangest political landscapes in our nation's history unfold.
And that is it for us tonight. Please check out the Fox News, ""Factor"" website, different from billoreilly.com. Also, we would like you to spot off by ""The Factor"" from anywhere in the world, oreilly@foxnews.com, oreilly@foxnews.com Name in town, name in town, name in town a few weeks to apply (ph).
Word of the day, no billingsgate. Sounds like a tube stop in London. No billingsgate. I'm writing to ""The Factor"". Again, thanks for watching us tonight. I'm Bill O'Reilly. Please remember that the spin stops here. We're definitely looking out for you."
0	22	 23 von 72	Fox News Network	January 5, 2017 Thursday	 TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT	 7:00 PM EST		"TUCKER CARLSON, FOX NEWS HOST: Well, good evening, and welcome to ""Tucker Carlson Tonight.""
Four people in Chicago face felony hate crime charges; in addition to many other charges after they allegedly kidnapped and tortured a mentally disabled man and broadcasted that hideous attack on Facebook.
Video shows the attackers, who were black, yelling ""F Donald Trump"" and ""F white people.""
Craig Wall of WFLD Fox Chicago has been covering the story all day and he joins us for an update.
Craig, what's the latest? 
CRAIG WALL, WFLD FOX CHICAGO REPORTER: The superintendent today called this video reprehensible and prosecutors officially called it a crime, filing those charges against the four suspects. They included hate crime, kidnapping, battery, as well as unlawful imprisonment, and some additional charges against the two sisters, as well as one of the suspects, who was a friend.
You saw the video happen on Tuesday. We know that's when the torture happen. But it all actually began on Saturday when the victim got together with one of the suspects, a friend of his, Jordan Hill, for a sleep over for New Year's. They ended up in Chicago at the apartment of those two sisters and police say it all started when there was a friendly fight that escalated, things got ugly, and then all of a sudden, the two sisters got mad about what had happen.
Police said that the suspects had all been drinking and smoking marijuana. That's when they bound and tortured that 18-year-old victim, who is mentally challenged. The torturing went on for four to five hours, police said. The noise from it created so much of a commotion that neighbors down below went upstairs, knocked on the door and said, hey, knock it off or we're going to call police.
We are told the two sisters then went downstairs, broke open the door of that neighbor's apartment and threaten them. Police were then called. And during that time, that is when the victim was able to escape his attackers. A police officer, who happen to pull up and respond to the complaint, saw the victim, who was outside, walking. He was dressed in a tank top inside out and backwards, wearing shorts and walking in sandals looking battered and bloodied. The officer went up to the victim and tried to talk to him.
He found he was very discombobulated. And that's when police actually called an ambulance and got him taken in. The four suspects were then taken into custody. Just a short time ago, the victim's family, a representative spoke briefly saying that they have seen the video, found it very, very disturbing, as everyone else has.
They said the victim himself is doing OK, but beyond that, they didn't have a whole lot to say. The four suspects will be in bond court to face these charges tomorrow, and we could learn even more about what went on from prosecutors.
Back to you in New York.
CARLSON: Craig Well for us in Chicago. Thanks a lot, Craig.
Before we get to the next guest, let's listen to part of that tape again, in case you haven't heard it. Here it is.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (EXPLETIVE DELETED) Donald Trump. (EXPLETIVE DELETED) white people. (EXPLETIVE DELETED)
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: (INAUDIBLE)
(END VIDEO CLIP)
CARLSON: So, is this revolting attack a sign that anti-Trump hysteria is fueling violence? Does it stand for anything larger? And is the national media downplaying its existence?
We are joined now by national and syndicated radio talk show host Richard Fowler.
Richard, thanks for joining us.
RICHARD FOWLER, NATIONAL AND SYNDICATED RADIO TALK SHOW HOST: Good to be here, Tucker.
CARLSON: So it was interesting to see this morning that ""The New York Times"" this week in hate feature had no mention of this story. Why would that be?
FOWLER: I don't know. I'm not with ""The New York Times."" I think that this story --
CARLSON: Why did ""The Washington Post"" bury it? Why did ""The Boston Globe"" bury it?
FOWLER: I don't work either in those sort of publications. But I will say this, I think this is a crime. I'm happy that the new attorney of the new Cook County prosecutor charged these people with this. And it's wrong. And I think what we need to now focus on, whether it's black or white or gay or straight, is making sure that we have these, we continue to have hate crime laws like this throughout the country that protect people like this individual that was brutalized by those four maniacs.
CARLSON: Well, I don't believe in hate crimes law, because I don't think you should prosecute people based on their thoughts.
(CROSSTALK)
FOWLER: So you don't think this is a hate crime?
CARLSON: I think hate was involved as often is in crime. I'm not defending this crime. I'm merely saying it is a separate category. Hate crimes do value the idea of equality under laws. I'm also opposed to them, but I'm also opposed to lying and downplaying something that is obvious.
And it is clear that this man's race and his political position played a role.
FOWLER: Absolutely, which is why --
(CROSSTALK)
CARLSON: And the torment that he endured, well, that's not all clear from the accounts that were prevalent today. The Associated Press and its first account of the story didn't mention the racial and political angles of the story. I wonder why that is.
FOWLER: I don't know. I didn't work for the Associated Press.
(CROSSTALK)
CARLSON: We know there's like a theme here --
(CROSSTALK)
FOWLER: I think what we can say here --
(CROSSTALK)
CARLSON: ""The New York Times,"" the A.P. --
(CROSSTALK)
FOWLER: What I can say here is that the charges came down from the prosecutor, which is the final arbiter. There is no journalist and arbiter in this case.
CARLSON: Right.
FOWLER: The prosecutor is. And, eventually, the jury of these four individuals appears.
CARLSON: Right.
FOWLER: And those came down and said this was a hate crime. It was fueled by race. It was fueled by ideology and it's wrong. And that's why we need stronger hate crimes in this country to prevent instances like this...
CARLSON: Right.
FOWLER: ...and instance that go the opposite direction.
CARLSON: Yes. So we can have the government divining our thoughts and prosecute on the basis of it.
(CROSSTALK)
FOWLER: No. That's not what I'm saying.
CARLSON: But here's -- look, here's the point I am making. When a sensational crime like this occurs, the press is very quick and people on television are very quick, instantaneously, they draw massive conclusions. They extrapolate from it. They say this is a national trend.
When that lunatic shot up the black church in the south, Dylann Roof, we had a national conversation on white racism. Now I'm not against that such as national conversation. But if you are going to extrapolate from something like that, why the instantaneous downplaying of this as four crazy people in an isolated disabled man --
(CROSSTALK)
FOWLER: I know. I don't think -- I don't think anybody is isolating this all. If you look at all, if you look at the reporting that we have seen today, if you look at people just reporting the facts, which is, this individual was charged with a hate crime.
This prosecutor based upon the standards for a hate crime in the State of Illinois, thought that these four individuals were in violation of a hate crime. Just like Dylann Roof in, according to the statues of South Carolina, were in violation of a hate crime. That's why prosecutors who decide, not journalist.
CARLSON: Well, but we also draw conclusions from events, that's part of our job here in the commentarial.
Symone Sanders, a Democratic strategist in CNN you might know said this, quote, ""This is not a hate crime. Hate crimes are because of a person's racial ethnicity, religion, gender, disability. It isn't your political leanings because someone doesn't like your political leanings."" OK.
You had Don Lemon saying, quote, ""I don't think it's evil. I don't think it's evil. I think these are young people and I think they just had bad home training.
FOWLER: Last night on ""The Kelly File,"" I called this a hate crime. I was probably one of the first Democratic commentators to do so because it's a hate crime. It's a hate crime, it's wrong, it's vile, it's disgusting. And what they should cause us to do, Tucker, they should cause all of Americas, whether you are black, white, Hispanic, Jewish, Muslim, to say we are moving into a new presidency, how do we come to the table, because this is not America, right?
This is -- I would argue, this is not America as a Tulsa, Oklahoma shooting where that man was shot by the police officer.
How do we come together and have a conversation on making our country better? How do we have a conversation about looking beyond race, looking beyond gender, looking beyond --
(CROSSTALK)
CARLSON: Well, I'm totally with that. But, look, you know the truth, which is you walk into a certain neighborhood, you are the wrong color, and you are liable to get in trouble, OK? That is just true. I know it firsthand.
So you can't say that out loud in most venues because it doesn't --
(CROSSTALK)
FOWLER: Well, that's part of the problem. You need to have this conversation, right?
CARLSON: OK, good. So when I walk into this, when I go to Friendship Heights, which is in the D.C. area, or any high-end boutique and I'm followed around by a salesclerk because I happen to be African-American, it is the same as you going and getting in trouble in a black neighborhood.
We have to have these conversations to break the stigma down. When it happens to me, I go to the manager and say, you know, your clerk is following me, I'm here to make a purchase, this is wrong and we need to work on fixing it.
CARLSON: A man called Callum Borchers from ""The Washington Post"" wrote this and I think it sort of sums up perfectly the attitude from the left here.
""If the attackers had been white and the victim had been black, the incident would have, of course, conjured America's ugly history of white mobs committing violence against black people. There is no parallel history of the reverse happening on anything remotely approaching the same scale.
Now that might be right on the merits, but it is an obvious attempt to downplay the significance of this, because what's at stake, as you know, is victim status. And the idea that a Trump supporter might be a victim of a crime based on political belief --
(CROSSTALK)
FOWLER: (INAUDIBLE)
CARLSON: OK, but nobody wants to give up.
(CROSSTALK)
FOWLER: The prosecutor, the prosecutor was very clear.
CARLSON: And why are all these liberals trying to say that this is just one isolated example?
(CROSSTALK)
FOWLER: Here's the problem. This is not, I would argue that a hate crime is a hate crime. It's not, it doesn't have a political tilt to it. Dylann Roof, we don't blame Republicans for Dylann Roof. No. And we shouldn't blame Democrats for these four --
(CROSSTALK)
CARLSON: Are you joking?
FOWLER: I never blamed the Republicans for Dylann Roof.
CARLSON: Well, good for you. I'm glad that we have one reasonable person on this show.
(CROSSTALK)
FOWLER: And I think there's people -- Dylann Roof is a rage maniac racist.
(CROSSTALK)
CARLSON: Were you in this country when that happened?
(CROSSTALK)
I mean, by the way, let me just say, I agree with what you are saying, right? But what I disagree with it is unwillingness to acknowledge what's been happening for the past three or four years.
There is a mass shooting that fits the prescribed media narrative and all of a sudden --
(CROSSTALK)
FOWLER: Let's be very clear. So after the Dylann Roof case, there was a campaign to take down the confederate flag from flying over South Carolina, which was the right thing to do. And the governor, Republican governor --
CARLSON: They banned ""The Dukes of Hazard"" from television. As if every southerner or every conservative who like to watch ""The Dukes of Hazard"" was implicated of a crime.
(CROSSTALK)
FOWLER: No, no, no. We are having -- that's two different conversations. I think with the Dylann Roof incident brought to life is the fact --
(CROSSTALK)
CARLSON: They did that after Dylann Roof.
FOWLER: Well, let me make a point. After the Dylann Roof incident was brought to life, the fact that in South Carolina, the confederate flag flies over the Capital. Both Democrats and Republicans in South Carolina agreed it was a bad idea.
Waiving the confederate flag, which is the flag that stands for racism, bigotry and hatred is wrong.
(CROSSTALK)
CARLSON: If that had something to do with, look, it's demagoguery.
FOWLER: It's not.
CARLSON: It tries to tie people who are not responsible for a specific crime to --
FOWLER: I think that's only in your mind, Tucker.
CARLSON: In my mind?
FOWLER: Yes.
CARLSON: They banned ""The Dukes of Hazard"" from television.
(CROSSTALK)
FOWLER: We are having a conversation about four individuals who committed a hate crime and the confederate flag.
(CROSSTALK)
CARLSON: I get it. I get it. Just apply the same standard.
(CROSSTALK)
FOWLER: I have. I absolutely have, but you can't lump the whole party in with it. That's the argument I am making. It's a hate crime. It's wrong. It's disgusting. It shouldn't happen. It's the time to bring our country together.
(CROSSTALK)
CARLSON: You are not being honest, Richard. You are not applying the same standard.
(CROSSTALK)
FOWLER: I am. I am being absolutely honest. Are you going to tell me what standard I am not applying?
(CROSSTALK)
CARLSON: We are out of time.
FOWLER: Good to see you, Tucker.
CARLSON: Thanks very much. Thank you.
FOWLER: Congratulations.
CARLSON: Top U.S. intelligence officials visited Capitol Hill today where they reiterated their belief that the Russian government actively meddled in the U.S. election.
Here are some highlights from today's testimony.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
SEN. JOHN MCCAIN (R), ARIZONA: Every American should be alarmed by Russia's attack to our nation.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The hacking was only one part of it.
MCCAIN: And the aftermath, an unprecedented attack on our democracy.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It also detailed the classical propaganda, disinformation, fake news.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Ladies and gentlemen, it is time now not to throw pebbles, but to throw rocks. Putin is up to no good and he better be stopped.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
CARLSON: Well, ""Fox News"" chief intelligence correspondent Catherine Herridge is covering the story at the Capitol tonight and she joins us from there.
Catherine, what's going on?
CATHERINE HERRIDGE, FOX NEWS CHIEF INTELLIGENCE CORRESPONDENT: Well, thank you, Tucker.
Really, the bottom line is that the witnesses testified that they are more confident today than they were back in October that this was Russian interference, that it came from the highest levels of the government. But no one blamed Vladimir Putin by name and no one said that this was done to help Donald Trump win and to make sure that Hillary Clinton lost.
They did testify that it was a multifaceted campaign that involved the theft of the emails from the DNC and the Clinton campaign, as well as disinformation, as well as fake news. But they also testified that they never found any evidence that the voting on the ballots was changed in any way. And they really couldn't speak to the impact on public opinion and whether that influenced how they voted at the end of the day.
Now, there are several reports here. We've got this classified report that went to the president today. This will also be brief to Congress. And then the president-elect will get his briefing tomorrow, and then, early next week, we believe Monday, based on our reporting, there will be an unclassified report that's available to the public. And the witnesses testified today they're going to try and be very forward leaning in providing a lot of detail about who exactly was pulling the strings on this thing and what their motivation and intent was, Tucker.
CARLSON: So what is the significance, if any, Catherine, of the timing here?
HERRIDGE: Look, I have been covering this area for more than a decade. And it's always important to look at the timing of events. You know, from working in this town, when there is a big rollout of information, this tends to be almost choreographed by the party that's in power.
And we asked the White House today if the report was just final this week. How was it that the administration imposed sanctions on Russia last week and then expelled 35 Russian diplomats if they didn't have the final report?
CARLSON: Right.
HERRIDGE: And what they said is that they wanted a forceful response and they didn't need more information to do that. But it begs the question, what does a forceful response mean when the hacking is well-documented and it began over a year ago, Tucker?
CARLSON: Right. Well, that' the question right there.
Catherine, thanks a lot.
HERRIDGE: You're welcome.
CARLSON: Well, for more on Russia's alleged electoral malfeasance, we are joined now by former House speaker, author and informal Donald Trump advisor Newt Gingrich.
Mr. Speaker, thanks for joining us.
NEWT GINGRICH, FORMER SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE: Good to be here.
So what's the truth, in your view, at the bottom of this? To what extent did the Russians interfere in this election?
GINGRICH: No more than the United States interferes all over the world to the U.S. information agency. I mean, I don't see any -- apparently, and I have not seen the report.
Apparently, the report says they didn't change any votes. I don't even understand what the word hacking means in this context. They apparently did not go in to try to change any votes in any precinct in America.
CARLSON: Right.
GINGRICH: So the American people voted without interference. The Russians may have engaged in disinformation. Whether that's more disinformation than ""The New York Times"" routinely engages in, I have no idea. And I don't take it -- this is a country where ""Al Jazeera"" is available by cable for Pete's sake.
CARLSON: So you heard a number of different intelligence officials express outrage that President-elect Trump was in effect degrading what they do or casting aspersions on their honesty.
GINGRICH: Well, I'm happy to catch aspersions. I believe we have clear evidence over and over again that there are people very high in the intelligence community who have been politically redesigning what they say and who were trying to respond to what they thought the Obama administration wanted.
We have a clear case in the central command where 50 different analysts signed a letter, which is very unusual, saying that their commanding general had been pressuring them to understate the power of ISIS to fit the White House's definition.
Now, that's a clear problem. There's an inspector general investigation right now. And they were basically saying their implication was that the director of national intelligence was putting pressure on the central command to produce reports that fit the White House's world.
CARLSON: That would be James Clapper.
GINGRICH: That would be James Clapper, who I've known and is a good friend. And I thought very highly of James over the years, but the fact is, those 50 analysts argue that the pressure was on to issue reports that understated the danger of ISIS.
CARLSON: So am I misremembering this? This is James Clapper who said today, the director of national intelligence, who said, and I'm quoting, our assessment is now even more resolute that Russia interfered in this election.
It's a politically charged thing to say. Is this the same James Clapper, who assured the country that the NSA was not spying on Americans? Was he lying when he said that?
GINGRICH: Well, that's the whole challenge you've got. And we probably need a national dialogue. I'm not sure we need a national debate. But we need a national dialogue about how the modern world is going to work.
You have -- Sony gets hacked, presumably by North Korea, although, we don't totally know that. The fact is we don't have a very good grip on how this stuff works. And who does what.
And you have people who have falsifying operations. So, maybe it was the Russians, or maybe it was the Chinese pretending to be the Russians. We don't understand all of this stuff. I am very suspicious that this has been going on for -- I mean, what does it say to you about the American intelligence system. This has been going on for over a year. They don't really discover it until Trump wins? I mean, why weren't they saying it six or eight or nine months ago?
CARLSON: Having been around this lot, they said you can surmise. Do you think, actually, the intelligence community doesn't know? That's possible?
GINGRICH: I think -- let me say up front. I'm very sympathetic to how hard it is to know things that are secret. I mean, I went through and reviewed the weapons of mass destruction report that was the base of the IRAQ campaign under Bush. And I think it was honestly their best assessment. It was an assessment which the Russians, the Italians, the British and the French all agreed with.
CARLSON: Yes.
GINGRICH: And it turned out to be wrong, because the nature of intelligence is, you often don't know things, even if you think you know them. And we overvalue it in that sense.
It's important, but you shouldn't say that this is definitive. Cyber behavior, cyber warfare is a new world. None of us have a very good grip on it.
The national security agency is probably the best in the world. But they are the best in a way that is shrinking because the zones of greyness are getting bigger.
CARLSON: Right.
GINGRICH: The number of players are getting bigger. There are more and more small groups of criminal hackers who are astonishingly successful, who steal hundreds of millions of dollars a year. And in this environment, what I find suspicious, if you will, and then I don't want to overstate it --
CARLSON: Right.
GINGRICH: The president of the United States, Barack Obama, is in essence telling us, that in the last year of his administration, after he had seven years to fix this, something may have been going on for 12 months that they are not totally sure of. But now, in the last weeks, they have decided to issue a report, which is filled with uncertainty, while they are saying they are certain.
CARLSON: Right. Posing as absolute certainty. In that way, it's a classic Washington summation, I would say.
Mr. Speaker, thanks a lot for joining us.
GINGRICH: Good to see you.
CARLSON: Time now for ""Twitter Storm,"" our nightly forecast of social media's most powerful weather patterns.
Tonight, a simple question about a pickup truck is sending shock waves through the press. It all started when ""Decision Desk Daily's"" John Ekdahl twitted this.
He said the top three best-selling vehicles in America are pickups. Questions to reporters, ""Do you personally know someone who owns one?"" A pickup, that is.
Well, the response was sensitive.
""Washington Post"" national correspondent Jose DelReal said this, yes, because I'm from Alaska. Do any friends own one in D.C. or New York? No, because they are unnecessary here.
Sort of missing the point of the question. The answer was no.
(LAUGHTER)
""Vox"" columnist Will Wilkinson tweeted this, ""How many journalists know someone who owns a ferret?"" Going the non sequitur route.
""Mother Jones"" engagement editor Ben Dreyfuss said, quote, ""This is a very silly question, to which the top three population centers in America are liberal strongholds. Do you personally know someone there?"" Oh, Burn.
And, finally, ""New York Times"" science writer John Schwartz covers climate change tweeted this. ""That might be the dumbest question I have heard today. Of course, I do. That is not a word to drive a stick. Other buddies with pickups, since then, of course. This need to demonize reporters as unAmericans gets so old.""
That's where he is wrong. That need never gets old. Ever. It's like a fruit cake. It taste good one day. 20 years later, it still testate good.
That's tonight's ""Twitter Storm"".
How tough are things for American newspapers? So tough that even children can buy one.
The fact is here. A 19-year-old in Arkansas just bought his own hometown newspaper. He's got big plans for it and he joins us next.
Also, we will take you to Trump Tower, live, for a report straight ahead.
CARLSON: Well, American newspapers have been hurtling toward oblivion for decades, unfortunately. But one very brave 19-year-old in Arkansas thinks now is the time to enter the newspaper business.
Despite having no professional experience in journalism or may be because of it, he is brave enough to purchase his hometown paper.
His name is Hayden Taylor and he bought the ""Central Delta Argus-Sun,"" which he plans to make great again.
Mr. Taylor joins us now. Thanks for coming on.
HAYDEN TAYLOR, BOUGHT ""CENTRAL DELTA ARGUS-SUN"" NEWSPAPER: Thanks for having me.
CARLSON: So you bought the paper. Let me just say at the outside, I'm impressed. Most people your age are running towards Snapchat, but you are going towards newsprint.
How did you afford a newspaper at the age of 19?
TAYLOR: Well, as of right now, we have been working really on a handshake. It's been very unofficial. It's been a, honestly a big cobble work, but we have been able to get it by and it's been well within what I can afford.
CARLSON: Well, good for you. Why would you want to do this?
TAYLOR: Well, a paper, especially in Eastern Arkansas, it -- and I didn't know this until I had actually gotten involved with the ""Argus-Sun"", that it is a badge of pride for a community and I think that it is a, it's a worthwhile endeavor to try to keep it alive for as long as it can be.
CARLSON: Well, good for you. I once worked in newspaper in Arkansas, the state-wide daily, the ""Arkansas Democrat-Gazette."" A great paper. So identify with the desire.
But, I mean, there is nobody else in your age cohort. There's not one person who you went to high school with, who is thinking, you know, I want to buy a newspaper, or work at news -- or read a newspaper for that matter.
So what's your plan to keep this paper alive where so many others have failed?
TAYLOR: Well, I'm very aware that the national trend has been the downfall of newspapers. But in my particular area, there is still a demand for a paper. And as long as there is a demand, I am willing to invest in being the supplier.
It's just been -- it's been a little bit of struggle getting off the ground. But as of now, things are going very smoothly.
CARLSON: So now that you are sort of the William Randolph Hearst of the ""Argus-Sun,"" I mean, you got to misuse your power at a certain point. I mean, do you want to do something crazy with the paper every once in a while? I mean, put -- you know, write editorials against people you don't like? Or give bad reviews to movies you didn't care for?
I mean, what are you doing to make the paper yours?
TAYLOR: Well, as -- I mean, everybody is pretty well aware. I mean, I'm 19. No journalistic experience. I am not going to bite off more than I can chew. But I am trying to do right now is keep people on staff that do know exactly what they are doing.
CARLSON: Right.
TAYLOR: And I have kept the staff from the old ""Argus-sun,"" and they have proven to be fantastic at just this transition. But I don't really -- until I'm experienced and until it's all set in stone and everything is moving along smoothly, I'd rather not write my own editorial column, but I'd rather cover the news and allow people to write an editorial column because I am 19. My input, we can live without it.
CARLSON: Boy, you are a self-aware young man. I read one account that said it was amazing that you are not running a paper because you only took one journalism class. And I thought that is so much better. So you haven't been destroyed by taking journalism classes. You are still a normal person.
(LAUGHTER)
TAYLOR: Well, I don't know about that entirely, but I am doing my best to learn this as fast as I can. And I really think this is kind of trial by fire. So I am ready to move and just learn.
CARLSON: Last question, are you going to endorse candidates?
TAYLOR: Endorse who?
CARLSON: Endorse candidates when they run in your county? All these politicians are going to come and suck up to you. They're going to want editorial board meetings. They're going to sit there and glad hand you and try to convince you their program is right. Are you going to sit with them and listen to their pitches?
TAYLOR: If they want to run an ad, I will run an ad. Otherwise, no special treatment. I'd rather, I'd rather not get involved for fear of conflict of interest.
TAYLOR: That's the spirit. No journalism classes and you are already beating a lot of people at ""The Washington Post.""
Hayden, thanks a lot for joining us.
TAYLOR: Thanks for having me.
CARLSON: Coming up next, Donald Trump fires a salvo at Chuck Schumer today, calling the senate majority -- minority leaer, rather, the head clown of the Democrats. We will tell you what that fight is about coming up.
CARLSON: The Capitol Hill cataclysm over Obamacare has just begun. They Trump tweeted quote, The Democrats head by clown Chuck Schumer now how bad Obamacare is and what a mess they are in. Instead of working to fix it, they do the typical political thing and blame. For the fact is, Obamacare was a lie from the beginning. Keep your doctor, keep your plan. It is time for Republicans and Democrats to get together and come up with a health care plan that really works. Much less expensive and far better! Well, Senator Schumer shot back with this.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
CHUCK SCHUMER, INCOMING SENATE MINORITY LEADER: Instead of calling names, President-Elect should roll up his sleeves and show us a replacement plan that would cover the 20 million Americans who gain coverage.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
CARLSON: Well, former Mexico governor Bill Richardson has been on politics for out joins us now. Governor, thanks for coming on.
BILL RICHARDSON, NEW MEXICO GOVERNOR: Thank you, Tucker. Congratulations on your new show.
CARLSON: Thank you very much.
RICHARDSON: Hope you come on.
CARLSON: You are not a Trump voter, but you got to concede, Trump does have a point here. He has no role in creating our passing Obamacare. It was a purely Democratic operation pass on a party line vote and it is not working very well. Parts of it are fine. The parts of it are a disaster. And Chuck Schumer's attempt to pretend that it is Donald Trump's fault is a little much, no?
RICHARDSON: No. Look, what Schumer is saying, what Democrats are saying, and 20 million Americans that might lose coverage, ok, Republicans, you want to repeal it, fine, but what is your alternative? And so far, and the last seven years, I have not seen a Republican alternative. What is going to happen to the pre-existing condition that -- will that be eliminated? What about those kids between 21 and 26 years old? Will they be covered? Will costs go down? I mean, there is no beef there on the Republican side. I think what Schumer is asking legitimately is, ok, you want to repeal it? What is your alternative? What are you proposing?
CARLSON: I mean, I think we both know that pre-existing conditions and the ability to keep your kids on until late middle age or whatever it is are both very popular and they will stay. The costs as you know have risen. So it's not a question of bringing it down come as a question of stopping the rise. The real question is, what Democrats come if they were in charge, keep it the way it is? I mean is that the alternative Schumer is suggesting, it is doing fine, let's just keep it? Does anyone believe that?
RICHARDSON: I think what President Obama said, what Democrats are looking at is, yes, there is no question, especially during the election. Some of the premiums went up. How can we keep the costs down? I think that is a legitimate issue. There are issues relating to states and Medicaid. You know, a lot of states, it was a lot of Republican governors, including the one here in New Mexico, chose to continue using Medicaid.
The big problem, Tucker, and the interim period between the repeal and a new law which some Republicans it said will take six months, what is the alternative? What is going to happen to all of these people, 20 million that are under Obamacare? It is not just poor people. It is the middle class. It is Anglos, Hispanics, you were talking in your previous segment that it should cover everybody.
CARLSON: Well, I mean I don't think it quite is a racial question, but I mean if 20 million out of a country of 335 million, not a huge -- I mean, the truth is, the system itself doesn't work. And I think most Democrats privately will concede that. So, why wouldn't the Democrats say, here are our ideas for reforming it, I hate to think that, because of this president's signature achievement, and they wouldn't want to concede that it doesn't work. They know it doesn't work. What don't they admit it?
RICHARDSON: Well, look, the reality is that Republicans controlled the house, the senate, and the presidency. So, now, it is their responsibility to govern. So what is wrong with Republicans saying, repeal, all right, you want to repeal, but what is the alternative? I have not seen an alternative on their side. So, the burden is on those that won the election. And I think Donald Trump legitimately won the election. I'm worried about his criticism of the intelligence community, denying Russian hacking. But I concede and I want him to succeed. He is my president, although, during this period, he has not respected that it presidential transition. There is only one president. He is tweeting policy and programs before he even takes office. That is not right. That makes me uncomfortable.
CARLSON: It's not right for him to express his opinion before he sworn in. Let me just ask you. You saw the Democrats on The Hill with their sign, make America sick again, which is what they claim Trump will do. If you look at life expectancy in the United States, it is going up for some groups since Obamacare past. It has declined precipitously for other groups. The outcome doesn't seem to be at all that we expected. A lot of people are dying earlier than they did when Obama took office. Does that factor into your consideration of whether Obamacare was successful?
RICHARDSON: Well yes, look. I think it has been successful. Yet, there are flaws. We could make it better, maybe...
CARLSON: Dying earlier?
(LAUGHTER)
RICHARDSON: That is not good, but you know 70 today, I'm not there yet, that is the 50s and 60s of the past. You don't have to worry about that. You are still a young guy, but I think at the same time, Tucker, let's reform it. Let's make it better but not repeal it. With no alternative, this is not going to be good policy. And it ends up it's not going to be good politics.
CARLSON: Well I think if they repeal with no alternative that indeed would be hard to imagine that happening. We'll see. Governor, thanks for joining us.
RICHARDSON: Thank you.
CARLSON: Donald Trump once again spent the day in New York City. Fox News National Correspondence John Roberts is outside Trump Tower. He was on the road with Trump for a year or more, John, great to see you tonight.
JOHN ROBERTS, SENIOR NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: It only seems like it was a year or more, Tucker. Imagine that. Good to see you tonight. Business pretty much wrapped up here at Trump Tower that Donald Trump is still tweeting. We will get to that in a second. The big news today is that Donald Trump has settled on his choice for the new director of national intelligence, it will be the retiring senator from Indiana, Dan Coats. He served 3 terms in the senate. Consecutively he sat in the select committee on intelligence and the armed services. He was also the ambassador to Germany for a time. He was famously kept out of Russia, which he sort of wears like a badge of honor. The official announcement could come as early as tomorrow.
That it was what Donald Trump has a significant intelligence briefing, the same report that President Obama saw on the alleged Russian hacking, and that is set to Donald Trump to tweeting tonight, apparently, NBC tonight has an exclusive look at the classified report. Donald Trump writing on twitter, ""How did NBC get an exclusive look into the top-secret report he, Obama has presented, who gave him this report and why, Politics."" Trump also tweeting, ""the Democratic National Committee would not allow the FBI to study or see the computer info after it was supposedly hacked by Russia."" So, clearly this is very much on the President-Elect's mind as he gets set to meet with James Clapper, the current DNI. John Brennan, who is the CIA Director, James Comey, the FBI director in what will be a very big intelligence briefing tomorrow.
At the same time, the Trump transition has been beating back against ""The Wall Street Journal"" report out this morning that Trump plans on a significantly restructuring the office of the director of national intelligence and the CIA, bearing back staff at the DNI, which Donald Trump has said to believe in his report to be bloated and politicized, clearly, by these tweets tonight. He does think that there is a lot of politics and intelligence. And with the CIA thinking of turning back some of the staff of the headquarters, and putting more people out in the field. Sean Spicer, who is the incoming press secretary, beat back strongly against that on the transition conference call this morning saying, it is just not true. Listen to what Spicer said.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
SEAN SPICER, RNC CHIEF STRATEGIST: The President-Elect's top priority will be to ensure the safety of the American people and the security of the nation. And he is committed to finding the most effective way to do it, but I want to reiterate, there is no truth to this idea of restructuring the intelligence community infrastructure. It is 100 percent false.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
ROBERTS: Donald Trump also clarifying his stance on Juliann Assange after tweeting earlier this week what Assange said about Russia not being involved in dispensing the information that WikiLeaks leak. A lot of people thought that he was supporting Assange and he did have the disclaimer on his twitter feed that said retweets are not an endorsement. Trump coming out today and said I am not supporting Assange, I am simply restating what he has said. People said I am not a fan of intelligence. That is absolutely incorrect. I am a big fan. Though, transition sources do tell us Tucker, that Donald Trump would like to streamline the intelligence community and to depoliticize it, as well, Tucker.
CARLSON: John Roberts from Trump Tower. Thanks a lot, John. The autocrats have struck one again this time. The University of Oregon a law professor Eugene Volokh will tell us why this threatens the free-speech rights of all of us. He is next.
CARLSON: Well America's universities are teaming with countless petty tyrants. Recently, at the University of Oregon, a professor was suspended for wearing black face to a Halloween Party, even though she says she was trying to send an antiracist message by doing it. Law professor Eugene Volokh says that Oregon's decision is a harbinger of the destruction of free speech rights on American campuses. Professor Volokh joins us now. Professor thanks for coming on.
EUGENE VOLOKH, UOO LAW PROFESSOR: Thanks for having me.
CARLSON: If you will just reassure me that I'm not missing something in the story. This professor wore black face to a party. She is trying to represent a book that she thought that would evoke. And she says she wasn't doing this as part of some sort of minstrel show or to offend anyone, but to take a stand against racism. Moreover, no one in the party complained. Are those the facts as you know them?
VOLOKH: So, first, it was a party, at her own a house. There were some students she'd invited. She invited her class as many professors do. It was her party at her house. There was some indication that the students felt somewhat uneasy. But the concern was that the students were upset, then, other students who heard about it later on at the law school got upset. And lots of them heard about it, because the law school made a big deal of having these discussions about it. That helped create the hostile environment that made for speech punishable.
CARLSON: Ok. They centered and pretty clear terms, that the actual disruption in harms University resulting from what she did are significant enough to outweigh her interest in academic freedom and freedom of speech. So, they are in effect saying by dressing this way, she caused harm to people at the school?
VOLOKH: Well not only are they saying that, the implication is the same with regard to any kind of speech. Even outside of school, that might be seen as racially offensive, whether intentionally or not, as religiously offensive. Imagine somebody goes to somebody's house and there is a poster of the Mohammed cartoons. I actually blogged the Mohammed cartoons at one point on my blog. Somebody reads my blog and they say, oh, no, I am now offended for religious reasons, because I am Muslim, the hypothetically person would say. Then, a whole bunch of other students make a big thing of this. The school starts having more discussions and then the University comes in and says, oh, it is now so disruptive, and large part, because of the school has actually made it a big thing of this. Now, Volokh is going to be punished for it and any other professor as well.
CARLSON: They get away with this, it seems to me, not by saying we are against free speech, nobody want to say that out loud, but they are, but by equating words they disagree with, with violence. I feel unsafe when you say that.
VOLOKH: Well that is a big part of it. A lot of students say that. The university is more saying it is discrimination. And it's true that if the professor decides to grade down a student, because of their race or religion, that is obviously a violation of the law, in violation of the constitution. But what they are doing, they are saying that speech that offends certain groups is tantamount to legal discrimination. So they are indeed re-characterizing speech as conduct that is now stripping off protection.
CARLSON: No one is defending offensive speech. I am not. But once freedom of speech goes, it's over. That is it. Mr. Volokh thanks a lot.
VOLOKH: That is absolutely right and again...
CARLSON: Please finish your sentence.
VOLOKH: Again, this is not just an about allegedly racially offensive speech, the same thing could apply by the way to speech that is critical of homosexuality or critical of certain claims about gender identity and transgender status. So long as some identifiable group can be really offended by this, and can turn and this offense turns into more disruption of school, that is a reason enough to suspend or perhaps even fire a tenured faculty member.
CARLSON: That is right. Ultimately, political speech will qualify.
VOLOKH: This was a form of political speech.
CARLSON: That is right, exactly. Professor thanks a lot for joining us. That was interesting and ominous.
VOLOKH: Thanks for having me.
CARLSON: Straight ahead, the great Melissa Francis joins us in ""The Friend Zone"" that is next.
CARLSON: Time now for ""The Friend Zone,"" we invite one of our friends in the building here at Fox onto the show. A lot of people at Fox had lives before Fox. But very few have had a life as interesting as Fox Business Network's Melissa Francis. Melissa it is great to see you tonight.
MELISSA FRANCIS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK AFTER THE BELL CO-HOST: Great to see you. I am so excited to be associated with you tonight. You are like the King of Cable. So I just wanted to rub off on me.
(LAUGHTER)
CARLSON: I don't feel very kingly, but thank you very much. Long before you got onto this business, you were an actor. I'm sure many of our viewers know that. But your writing, I think, a book about that.
FRANCIS: That is true. I have a new book that comes out in April. There is a cover right there. And basically, most self-help books are really annoying. This one will actually make you snort with laughter, mostly at me. I make fun of myself throughout almost the whole book. But then along the way I came up with some good lessons, some great formulas to kind of tackle the problems that dog everyone. What I realized was when I left Hollywood, which is insane, as you know, that a lot of the great values that they learned on the prairie really apply to the rest of your life and the rest of America outside of Hollywood, like self-reliance, independence, hard work, all of those kinds of things.
CARLSON: Oh, I love that. How old were you when you started ""Little house on the prairie?""
FRANCIS: I was eight years old, Pardon me, I contract my throat there, I am so nervous to be on with you, Tucker.
(LAUGHTER)
The King of Cable, I was on the show when I was eight years old, I was only on for two seasons, but it was a lot of fun. Michael Landon was very spirited, as most people know. But he is very hard-working. He was an entrepreneur. He owned that show, I don't if people realize when he left ""Bonanza,"" he took that formula and he redid it on ""Little house."" And he owned it, he produced it, he wrote it, he starred in it, and he was cheap as hell, which was very cool to see as a child, because in Hollywood, you think you have extravagant expense and people throwing money around, it was his money. He knew better. A lot the kids learned the lesson from that. I was having dinner with Melissa Gilbert, she said, it is so interesting that none of us ended up like robbing a drycleaner or the other things you hear about, in rehab. It is because of Michael Landon. He picked kids that were hard workers. But then he also taught us those very basic ethics that you actually saw on the show. About showing up with your lines learned, hitting your mark, and really, their pride of an honest day's work. Anyway he took all of that though.
CARLSON: I love that. I'm going to buy that book. I think it's great.
FRANCIS: I would expect nothing less.
(LAUGHTER)
CARLSON: I'm going to. Thanks. See you.
FRANCIS: All right.
CARLSON: Coming up, we will close the show with in an important announcement for all of our viewers. And we will tell you what that is when we come back. Stay tuned.
CARLSON: We haven't been here long, but they show is moving. Our Megyn Kelly is moving on to pursue a new adventure at NBC. And we are fortunate to move into her old time slot, 9:00 p.m. Eastern time. We are going to start on Monday. We begin this show at seven, two months ago. We told you the people in power tend to lie. We told you that they use their power not because they want to, but because they are bad people, because human nature makes it inevitable. It is the job of the press to call out those abuses. Instead, the press often gravels of the feet of the powerful. We promise you we wouldn't do that. We promise you we would hold the powerful to account, we would pierce pomposity, we translate doublespeak, we mock smugness, and we barbecue nonsense.
We will try to continue to do all of that. Thanks to this new opportunity for Rupert Murdoch and Fox, we will do it two hours later 9:00 p.m. Eastern. We are overwhelmed with the support we got from you, the viewers, and from all of our friends here tonight. Thanks. Hope you will joins us for a final night at 7:00 p.m. tomorrow, and starting Monday, it's on to 9:00 p.m. and our friend Martha MacCallum, one of the great people here at Fox, is starting at 7:00 p.m. January 16th. ""The O'Reilly Factor"" is next. We will see you tomorrow."
0	23	 24 von 72	Fox News Network	January 5, 2017 Thursday	 FOX SPECIAL REPORT WITH BRET BAIER	 6:00 PM EST		"BRET BAIER, FOX NEWS CHIEF POLITICAL ANCHOR: A multifaceted campaign -- hacking, propaganda, and fake news. Intelligence leaders double down on Russia's efforts before the election while the President-Elect pushes back on reporting of plans for a major intel revamp.
This is SPECIAL REPORT.
Good evening. Welcome to Washington. I am Bret Baier.
The top leaders in the intelligence community stand behind the assessment that Russia was behind the hacks leading up to the 2016 election. During testimony today on Capitol Hill, intel leaders told lawmakers the highest levels of the Russian government directed or were aware of the campaign. 
The intel leaders also made clear they found no evidence that a single vote was altered by the hacks. There is still much we don't know though about the intel community's ultimate conclusions.
Chief intelligence correspondent Catherine Herridge joins us, live from Capitol Hill with a look at today's testimony. Good evening -- Catherine.
CATHERINE HERRIDGE, FOX NEWS CHIEF INTELLIGENCE CORRESPONDENT: Well thank you -- Bret.
Witnesses testified today that they have never seen a cyber attack like this before.
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
JAMES CLAPPER, DIRECTOR OF NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE: I don't think that we have ever encountered a more aggressive or direct campaign to interfere in our election process.
HERRIDGE: Senior intelligence officials told the Senate Armed Services Committee they are more certain now about Russia's meddling than they were a month before the election.
CLAPPER: We stand actually more resolutely on the strength of that statement that we made on the seventh of October.
HERRIDGE: The witnesses said Russian interference was multifaceted, including the theft of DNC and Clinton campaign e-mails as well as fake news. But no evidence was found that ballots were tampered with.
CLAPPER: They did not change any vote tallies or anything of that sort, certainly the intelligence community can't gauge the impact it had on the choices that the electorate made. There's no way for us to gauge that.
HERRIDGE: The witnesses seemed to avoid identifying the Russian President Vladimir Putin by name but emphasized it came from the top.
SEN. JACK REED (D), RHODE ISLAND: And the same conclusion with respect to the involvement of high-level Russian authorities is shared by all these agencies?
CLAPPER: Yes.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Do you think a lot happens in Russia, big, that he doesn't know about?
CLAPPER: Not very many.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes, I don't think so either.
CLAPPER: Certainly none that are politically sensitive in another country.
HERRIDGE: The credibility of WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange who said Russia was not his source for the e-mails was attacked.
SEN. CLAIRE MCCASKILL (D), MISSOURI: The notion that the elected -- the soon-elected leader of this country would put Julian Assange on a pedestal compared to the men and women of the intelligence community -- I think it should bring about a hue and cry no matter whether you are Republican or a Democrat.
HERRIDGE: President Obama received a final report today and was briefed by the intelligence community leadership.
The unclassified report expected Monday will address who was behind the meddling and their goal.
SEN. BILL NELSON (D), FLORIDA: Do you think in the report next week that you all will ascribe a motivation to Putin for the election attempt?
CLAPPER: Yes, we will ascribe a motivation. 1 SEN. TOM COTTON (R), ARIZONA: UNIDENTIFIED MALE: In your 53 years of intelligence, is ascertaining the motives, plans and intentions of foreign leaders among the hardest tasks that we ask our intelligence services to perform?
CLAPPER: It always has been.
HERRIDGE: The committee's Republican chairman said the Obama administration shares some of the blame after failing to forcefully retaliate after China stole 22 million records in 2014 the Office of Personnel Management's security clearance database.
SEN. JOHN MCCAIN (R), ARIZONA: Our nation has no policy and thus no strategy for cyber deterrence. This appearance of weakness has been provocative to our adversaries who have attacked us again and again with growing severity.
HERRIDGE: After the hearing, the White House responded to McCain's statement that Russia crossed the line.
MCCAIN: It fits the definition of an act of war, but it doesn't mean that all of a sudden you start shooting.
JOSH EARNEST, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: I don't have a new label to apply to it today.
(END VIDEOTAPE)
HERRIDGE: The timing is worth noting Mr. Obama got the final report today yet last week his administration imposed sanctions on Russia and expelled 35 Russian diplomats. After the apparent gap in the timing today, a White House spokesman said they wanted a forceful response and they had enough to go on -- Bret.
BAIER: Catherine Herridge, live on Capitol Hill. Catherine -- thank you.
HERRIDGE: You're welcome.
BAIER: More on this with the panel. Several sources say the President- Elect has named the man he wants to be his next Director of National Intelligence, this as Mr. Trump is set to be briefed by the very leaders of the intelligence community that he has openly questioned about the veracity of reports of Russian hacks leading up to the election.
Senior national correspondent John Roberts joins us live from New York outside Trump Tower with the President-Elect's pick to head up the 17 intelligence agencies. Good evening -- John.
JOHN ROBERTS, FOX NEWS SENIOR NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Bret -- good evening to you.
Sources tell Fox News that Donald Trump has chosen the retiring Indiana Senator Dan Coats to be his next director of National Intelligence. Coats served three terms in the Senate, sat on the Select Committee on Intelligence as well as Armed Services and also during the Bush administration was the ambassador to Germany.
The choice of Coats comes just as Donald Trump prepares for what is probably the most significant intelligence briefing so far.
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
CLAPPER: I know there is a great interest in the issue of Russian interference.
ROBERTS: It could be a rather uncomfortable meeting tomorrow. The current Director of National Intelligence, James Clapper, who has made no attempt to hide his disdain for Donald Trump, will personally brief the President- Elect on suspected Russian hacking.
SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R), SOUTH CAROLINA: You're going to be challenged tomorrow by the President-Elect. Are you ok with being challenged?
CLAPPER: Absolutely.
GRAHAM: Do you both welcome it?
CLAPPER: We do.
GRAHAM: Do you think it is appropriate?
CLAPPER: We do.
ROBERTS: As the briefing nears, the Trump transition is pushing back hard against a report in the ""Wall Street Journal"" that Trump wants to make significant changes to the Office of National Intelligence because the agency has become bloated and politicized. And that he wants to cut staff at CIA headquarters in favor of putting more agents in the field.
Incoming press secretary Sean Spicer saying, ""not true"".
SEAN SPICER, INCOMING WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: I want to reiterate, there is no truth to this idea of restructuring the intelligence community infrastructure. It is 100 percent false.
ROBERTS: At the White House today, the outgoing press secretary deferred when asked if President Obama is worried his successor might dismantle parts of the intelligence apparatus.
EARNEST: I think it is difficult to tell exactly what the incoming president's plans actually are. That being said, the President tasked his administration and agencies all across this administration to be very focused on ensuring a smooth and effective transition with the incoming president's team and that includes the intelligence community.
ROBERTS: While the Trump transition denies any large-scale restructuring of intelligence, transition officials tell Fox News Trump is looking to streamline and depoliticize the intelligence community.
And Trump is clarifying his public posture toward WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange. Earlier this week, Trump tweeted, quote, ""Julian Assange said a 14 year old could have hacked Podesta. Why was DNC so careless? Also said Russians did not give him the info!""
After that provoked charges Trump was siding with Assange over U.S. intelligence, Trump today tweeted, quote, ""The dishonest media likes saying that I am in agreement with Julian Assange. Wrong. I simply state what he states. It is for the people to make up their own minds as to the truth. The media lies to make it look like I am against intelligence when in fact I am a big fan.""
(END VIDEOTAPE)
ROBERTS: And with just two weeks to go now until the inauguration, a significant distraction for Donald Trump this morning as he sat for more than an hour to give a videotaped deposition. It's the case involving a Washington, D.C., chef who was supposed to open a Spanish themed restaurant at the new Trump International Hotel there.
Jose Andre (ph) claims after Trump made his comments about Mexican immigrants 18 months ago he couldn't work with him anymore. Trump insists that Andre owes him damages big league -- Bret.
BAIER: John Roberts, live outside Trump Tower. John -- thank you.
""Horrifying"" and ""heartbreaking"" -- those are just some of the words being used to describe a sickening video of four black suspects who held a mentally-disabled man hostage and broadcast themselves live on Facebook torturing him and even yelling racist expletives at the white man.
President Obama called it ""despicable"" and ""a visual of the racial tensions in America"". Chicago police say, ""no one should ever have to see such a video"".
And today, as correspondent Matt Finn reports, the alleged assailants were charged with hate crimes.
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
MATT FINN, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: The captors seen in this terrifying torture video, beating a mentally-handicapped man and forcing him to drink from a toilet, now behind bars. These four suspects charged with a list of felonies including the most serious, hate crime and aggravated assault with a weapon.
The two males and two females gagged and tortured the 18-year-old helpless man, holding a dagger to his throat, cutting his scalp, screaming anti- white comments and forcing him to curse Donald Trump.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (EXPLETIVE DELETED) Donald Trump. (EXPLETIVE DELETED) white people, boy.
FINN: The abusers broadcast the torture live on Facebook for the world to see as they laughed and smoked. Police say he was held captive for up to 48 hours.
Police say they think the victim was directly targeted, perhaps for his race or mental impairments.
EDDIE JOHNSON, CHICAGO POLICE SUPERINTENDENT: The actions in that video are reprehensible; that, along with racism, have absolutely no place in the city of Chicago.
FINN: White House press secretary Josh Earnest calling the video a depravity.
EARNEST: I haven't spoken to the President about it, but I am confident that he would be angered by the images that are depicted on that video.
FINN: The video sparking upper online: people furious over what they consider a gruesome, politically charged attack; also calling out police for resisting to calling it a hate crime, one detective likening it to kids horsing around.
All this comes just days after Donald Trump made headlines for tweeting that Chicago's mayor needs help in fighting the city's record crime.
JOHNSON: I can't connect that with what these folks did.
FINN: Chicago's mayor weighing in.
MAYOR RAHM EMANUEL (D), CHICAGO: Anybody seeing -- it's both sickening and sickened by it. There is more to our city than that.
(END VIDEOTAPE)
FINN: The FBI and Department of Justice is aware of and assessing this video. All four suspects set to appear in court tomorrow -- Bret.
BAIER: Matt Finn, live in Chicago. Matt -- thank you.
We are learning more tonight about how both Democrats and Republicans plan to move forward on Obamacare. From the Republicans, a timeline; from the Democrats, a plan to fight the person who could be a key player in the future of healthcare.
Chief congressional correspondent Mike Emanuel has the latest from Capitol Hill tonight.
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
MIKE EMANUEL, FOX NEWS CHIEF CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT: With repealing and replacing Obamacare the dominant topic in the first week of the new Congress, Speaker Paul Ryan set this deadline.
REP. PAUL RYAN (R-WI), HOUSE SPEAKER: Our legislating on Obamacare, our repealing and replacing and transitioning -- the legislation will occur this year.
EMANUEL: Ryan also fired back at what he called scare tactics from Democrats.
RYAN: They are trying to make Americans think like, some day this February or some day this March, you're going to wake up and you won't have a health insurance plan. That isn't happening. That's not true.
EMANUEL: And when it is time to replace, a key House Republican predicted there will be at least some bipartisan support.
REP. MARSHA BLACKBURN (R), TENNESSEE: We're going to be able to get Democrats to vote with us on this because their constituents are disenfranchised. If they are committed to the goal of access to affordable health care for all Americans, they are going to work with us.
EMANUEL: President-Elect Trump ripped the opposition again today on Twitter. ""The Democrats, led by head clown Chuck Schumer, know how bad Obamacare is and what a mess they are in. Instead of working to fix it, they do the typical political thing and blame. The fact is Obamacare was a lie from the beginning. `Keep your doctor, keep your plan'. It is time for Republicans and Democrats to get together and come up with a healthcare plan that really works, much less expensive and far better.""
Schumer, the Senate Democratic leader was asked about being labeled a ""clown"" by Mr. Trump.
CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY), MINORITY LEADER: I'd say to the President-Elect and the Republicans that this is not a time for calling names. It is time for them to step up to the plate if they want to repeal and show us what they would replace it with.
EMANUEL: Schumer and other Democrats today attacked Mr. Trump's pick to lead Health and Human Services, Dr. Tom Price. They are calling for an ethics probe into reports Price traded hundreds of thousands of dollars in health-related stocks during his years in Congress.
Republicans are countering, noting that Price would be the first physician to lead HHS in more than 20 years. And groups like the Medical Association of Georgia are calling Price, a quote, ""strong and credible advocate for American patients and physicians"".
(END VIDEOTAPE)
EMANUEL: Price is an obvious target as a medical doctor who could be an important voice for the GOP healthcare vision. He is also seen as a key player during a possible transition to a new system -- Bret.
BAIER: Mike Emanuel, live on the hill. Mike -- thank you.
House Speaker Paul Ryan gave an impassioned speech on the House floor just last hour at the start of the debate on a congressional resolution condemning the Obama administration's decision to abstain from the U.N. Security Council's vote to condemning Israeli settlements.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
RYAN: I am stunned. I am stunned at what happened last month. This government, our government -- abandoned our ally, Israel, when she needed us the most.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
BAIER: We expect a vote tally from the House in the next hour.
President Obama penned a farewell letter to the American people today, and with it, he is sending a message that some critics say is not completely accurate.
Correspondent Kevin Corke reports from the White House tonight on how President Obama's memory of the last eight years looks a lot different from the other side of the aisle.
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
KEVIN CORKE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: While President Obama's letter to the American people and to spotlight his legacy and achievement, it may have missed the mark in several key areas.
BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: No foreign terrorist organization has successfully planned and executed an attack on our homeland these past eight years.
CORKE: The President's comments from Wednesday were reflected in his letter today, but didn't talk about the ISIS-inspired attacks that struck Fort Hood, Orlando, and San Bernardino.
On Obamacare he wrote, ""If you lose your job, change your job, or start that new business, you will finally be able to purchase quality affordable care and the security and peace of mind that comes with it."" But nowhere did he mention this.
OBAMA: If you like your doctor, you keep your doctor.
CORKE: On jobs, he wrote, ""The longest streak of job creation on record, wages have grown faster over the past few years than at any time in the past 40"". He left out the part about the work force participation rate being at historic lows.
On Iraq, the President said, ""We have drawn down from nearly 180,000 troops in harm's way in Iraq and Afghanistan to just 15,000."" The present didn't however, mention the fact that just last summer twice he authorized hundreds more American forces to deploy to Iraq; nor his failed goal to end the war there and in Afghanistan.
The President's letter was just one brick and a virtual wall of reflections designed to build upon the administration's story in full view of the American people and it included more than two dozen cabinet exit memos. Including the State Department, where Secretary John Kerry hailed the administration's progress in the fight against Putin, writing, ""In Iraq, ISIL controls less than 61 percent of the territory it once held. In Syria ISIL has lost over 28 percent of the territory it once held.""
But as in the President's letter, it left out important details, like the fact that ISIS has now spread far beyond the Levant.
Some experts question the wisdom of creating the memos because political virtual reality has little to do with political history.
DOUG WEAD, PRESIDENTIAL HISTORIAN: I think it is a mistake to play with your legacy. At this point, he's got it, whatever it is, and it is better now to leave with his dignity intact.
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
CORKE: Meanwhile, Bret, U.N. ambassador Samantha Power also had an exit memo. In it she said that American interests and in particular U.S. security would be greatly damaged were the United States to back away from its leadership role at the United Nations. And while there is no clear indication that will happen under the Trump administration, the President- Elect certainly has been critical of the world body before -- Bret.
BAIER: That is clear. Kevin Corke, live on the north lawn. Kevin -- thank you.
Secretary of State John Kerry delivered his own farewell remarks today. Over his four years at states, Kerry has traveled more than a million miles and visited more than 91 countries. Yet, he also acknowledged today that one particular episode in which he figured centrally wound up hurting American prestige in a critical region.
Chief Washington correspondent, James Rosen reports from the State Department.
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
JAMES ROSEN, FOX NEWS CHIEF WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT: In his final news conference at the State Department, Secretary of State John Kerry admitted that President Obama's failure to enforce his own redline against Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad back in 2013 resulted in damage to America's standing and credibility with allies across the Middle East.
JOHN KERRY, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: I will acknowledge to you, absolutely, I heard it all over the place. The perception hurt, yes. The perception hurt.
ROSEN: Yet Kerry rejected the idea that Syria would be better off today if President Obama had launched air strikes against the regime in Damascus as promised in retaliation for Assad's use of chemical weapons, the very red line Mr. Obama drew.
Instead the U.S. and Russia hastily hatched a plan to evacuate Syria's declared stockpile of chemical weapons. Since then, close to 200,000 lives have been lost and ISIS declared its caliphate in Raqqa.
But Kerry claimed that Mr. Obama never withdrew his threat of force and the outcome achieved at the time was preferable.
KERRY: We actually got a far better result of getting all of the weapons of mass destruction out of Syria without dropping a bomb. And if we had dropped a bomb, there is no guarantee we would have gotten any of them out.
ROSEN: Is Syria today a better result, sir?
KERRY: No. Syria is -- has nothing to do with that.
I feel very much at home here.
ROSEN: In a 30-minute recapitulation of his accomplishments, Kerry cited the restoration of ties with Cuba, the Paris Climate Accords and the Iran nuclear deal. And he touted allied successes in rolling back ISIS from several cities in Iraq, all captured by the terrorist group during Kerry's tenure at State even as he conceded the group remains a threat.
KERRY: We did not let the worst happen. We turned it around.
(END VIDEOTAPE)
ROSEN: Kerry also defended his department's decision to allow the passage of that U.N. Security Council measure that sharply criticized Israeli settlement activity. Kerry himself worked hard on the Israeli-Palestinian issue, obviously without success, but he thanked President Obama for giving him, quote, ""a long leash to try"" -- Bret.
BAIER: James Rosen at the State Department. James -- thank you.
Up next, trouble in the air after an engine falls off an Air Force plane midflight.
First here's what some of our Fox affiliates around the country are covering tonight.
Fox 24 in Charleston where the sentencing phase continued for a second day for the man convicted of killing nine black church members. Friends and family testified about some of the victims today despite shooter Dylann Roof arguing that the emotional testimony is prejudicing the case against him. Jurors are weighing whether to sentence Roof to life in prison or to death.
Fox 25 in Boston, where the Bristol County sheriff is offering to send inmates to the Mexican border to help President-Elect Donald Trump build a wall. Republican Sheriff Thomas Hodgson says -- announced today an initiative suggesting that inmates could volunteer to build the wall or cleanup disaster sites. The American Civil Liberties Union calls the proposal inhumane and promised to fight any plan that the sheriff puts forward.
And this is a live look at Chicago from Fox 32, a day after Macy's announced its plans to close 68 stores and cut more than 10,000 jobs across the U.S. Sears and KMart followed suit with the announcement of even more closures than were originally announced last month. In total, KMart will shut down just more than 100 KMart stores and Sears will close more than 40 locations. Sears Holdings based outside Chicago says it is a, quote, ""difficulty but necessary step to strengthen its operations.
That's tonight's live outside the Beltway from SPECIAL REPORT.
We'll be right back.
BAIER: The United States Air Force is investigating after one of its B-52s lost an engine midflight.
National security correspondent Jennifer Griffin joins us live from the Pentagon with more on what could be the prime example of how dire the situation may be with aging Air Force equipment -- Jennifer.
JENNIFER GRIFFIN, FOX NEWS NATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT: Good evening - - Bret.
We have learned today of yet another alarming sign that U.S. Air Force bomber aircraft are wearing out.
This latest incident occurred during a routine training mission at Minot Air Force base in North Dakota yesterday. The pilot declared an in-flight emergency after the engine of a B-52 literally fell off the aircraft while it was flying. Fortunately, a B-52 bomber has eight engines.
The aircraft was not armed at the time. There were no injuries. The five Air Force personnel on board and the pilot were able to land safely.
The engine landed in an unpopulated area 25 miles northeast of Minot, according to an Air Force statement.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
REP. MAC THORNBERRY (R), TEXAS: We have seen a disturbing increase in accidents of all kinds. And I do think you see the effects of wear-and- tear grow over time. It's just like your car or your house, if you don't take care of something the problems grow and then when you do have to fix it, it costs more money.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
GRIFFIN: Last year, Fox News broke the story about the strained air frames and the impact on Air Force readiness, traveling to Ellsworth Air Force Base in South Dakota not far from Minot. There we found only 9 out of 20 B-1 bombers assigned to the squadron were airworthy. They maintenance team there told us how hard they had to work to get the parts to keep these planes airborne.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
MASTER SGT. BRUCE PFROMMER, U.S. AIR FORCE: The first jet I worked on 20 years ago had a thousand flight hours on it. Now we're looking at some of the airplanes out here, they're pushing over 10,000 flight hours. It's not only the personnel that are tired, it's the aircraft that are tired as well.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
GRIFFIN: Following the loss of the B-52 engine yesterday, the Minot wing commander stood up an initial safety investigation board to investigate this unusual incident -- Bret.
BAIER: Jennifer Griffin, live at the Pentagon. Jennifer -- thank you.

In Baghdad today, 27 people were killed, including 11 from a suicide bomber who targeted shops and food stands near a bus station, several attacks led to a particularly deadly day in and around the Iraqi capital. No one has immediately claimed responsibility for these attacks, but they are similar to other ISIS-linked attacks in Iraq.
Turkish authorities say they are closing in on a suspect who carried out Sunday's attack on an Istanbul nightclub.
And as correspondent John Huddy reports, investigators believe he may not be tied ISIS after all.
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
JOHN HUDDY, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Turkish authorities say the circle is closing in on the gun man who killed 39 people early Sunday morning at a nightclub in Istanbul.
Turkey's Deputy Prime Minister Veysi Kaynak says police know who he is and his, quote, ""probable whereabouts"", describing him as a specially trained attacker.
VEYSI KAYNAK, TURKEY'S DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER (through translator): When we watch all of the videos, it seems that this is a very sophisticated incident. It is understood that his plan was well studied.
HUDDY: Sophisticated enough that other Turkish officials have suggested that a foreign intelligence service, that is, another country may have orchestrated the attack. ISIS claimed responsibility for it but the gun man's connection to ISIS, if any, remains unclear.
Conspiracy theories aside, Turkish officials say he is likely from the Uighur community in Turkey, the ethnic group of Chinese Muslims living in central and eastern Asia. Turkish police detained several people from that community during a raid this morning outside Istanbul.
Authorities also believe he was the sole shooter, though someone inside the club, possibly a lookout, may have helped him. Police are also not ruling out the possibility the gun man may have already left the country.
KAYNAK: We don't disregard that possibility, but I surmise we will get a result from operations across the country since security is tightened at the airports.
HUDDY: Turkish police say they have arrested 36 people since Sunday's massacre including 20 suspected ISIS militants from Central Asia yesterday in the Turkish city of Ismir. That's where a car bomb exploded outside the city's courthouse today killing two people. Though officials say it may have been the work of Kurdish militants.
(END VIDEOTAPE)
HUDDY: Yet more violence in a country already dealing with battles on several fronts. Turkey's deputy prime minister also added that these attacks will not stop his country from being active in the wars in Iraq and Syria -- Bret.
BAIER: John Huddy in our Middle East newsroom. John -- thank you.
Back here in the U.S., a fight is under way in New York City to preserve the records of about a million city residents who used a municipal program to get an ID Card. Those fighting to preserve the records say it is a matter of national security. Others say it has the potential to give the Trump administration an opening to deport people living in the city illegally.
Correspondent David Lee Miller takes a look at both sides of this issue from New York.
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: One, two, and three.
DAVID LEE MILLER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Sara Coalridge (ph) is one of nearly a million New York City residents who have applied for a municipal ID Card.
SARA COALRIDGE, NEW YORK CITY RESIDENT: I just think as a British citizen living in the U.S., it is good to have a (inaudible) form of ID.
MILLER: While Coalridge has the proper visa to enter and remain in the U.S. most applicants for a New York City ID are undocumented immigrants.
Critics say obtaining a card is too easy. Acceptable documents needed by applicants can include an expired foreign passport and proof of a 15 day homeless shelter residents.
The program was created under the administration of Democratic mayor Bill de Blasio to help people who have no other recognized form of identification. A provision of the two-year-old law permits the city to purge all I.D. card data and documents at the start of this year. The delete option was designed to prevent a future Republican administration from using the information to deport undocumented immigrants. Two Republican state lawmakers have gone to court demanding the city not destroy the I.D. cards documentation. They say the issue has nothing to do with immigration but criminal activity.
RON CASTORINA, (R) NEW YORK STATE ASSEMBLY: You can't allow people with a scantily vetted I.D. card to open up bank accounts where they could perhaps finance terrorism, engage in all types of fraud.
MILLER: According to city records, since the I.D. program got underway, there have been 102 cases of likely fraud related to obtaining the cards. Mayor de Blasio is optimistic. The city's right to delete applicant documentation will be upheld in court.
BILL DE BLASIO, (D) NEW YORK CITY MAYOR: We are very confident in our position. Our city law is abundantly clear. It went unchallenged for two years. It is quite clear about the timelines, the methodology, and the need to protect people's confidentiality.
(END VIDEOTAPE)
MILLER: New York's deputy commissioner for counterterrorism testified today that the city's municipal ideas are of little use to those who want to commit acts of terror. He told the court that terrorists recently arrested have more widely accepted forms of identification. Bret?
BRET BAIER, FOX NEWS HOST: David Lee, thank you.
President-elect Trump called out another automaker on Twitter today for building its products in Mexico, but so far the company is standing its ground. He tweeted, quote, ""Toyota Motor said will build a new plant in Baja, Mexico, to build Corolla cars for U.S. No way. Build plant in U.S. or pay big border tax."" The Japanese automaker responded in part, writing, quote, ""Toyota has been part of the cultural fabric in the U.S. for nearly 60 years. Production volume or employment in the U.S. will not decrease as a result of our new plant in Guanajuato, Mexico."" The threat is similar to those targeted at Ford and General Motors on Twitter.
A mixed day on Wall Street with two industries retreating. The Dow industry felt 43 points, the S&P 500 dropped nearly two, while the NASDAQ closed up 11.
The annual Consumer Electronics Show is back in Las Vegas, and like all the years before, some of the innovations seen at this show is pretty incredible. Tonight senior correspondent Adam Housley gives us a sneak peak at some of the coolest technology that may be coming our way.
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
ADAM HOUSLEY, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: You might call it ""gadgetopia"" as the world converges on Sin City for the International Consumer Electronics Shows."" And 3500 exhibits pitching some 20,000 new products all trying to wow a worldwide audience of tech savvy buyers. From paper-thin TVs to Internet-connected cars, virtually everything here gives us a glimpse of what will be every day technology in the years to come.
MICHAEL GORMAN, ENGADGET, EDITOR IN CHIEF: It is a glimpse of the future at CS. Bigger and badder, this is always the case at CS. Voice control is huge, AI, it's kind of all of these things are coming together.
HOUSLEY: Bigger, smaller, smarter, and safer are the key words here. This fits in your wallet and charges your phone. One, a tad larger, charges your laptop, and this is the drive I.D. which makes smartphones inoperable in the car.
JESSE HOGGARD, CELLCONTROL VP OF MARKETING: A lot of the other options in the marketplace can't stop Facebook. They can't stop Snapchat. The can't stop Twitter. We can do that. We can prevent access to those apps.
HOUSLEY: One stand out is virtual reality, which has moved well outside the world of gaming and entertainment.
KEVIN CORNISH, MOTH FLAME VR FOUNDER: The greatest thing about VR is it allows people to connect with each other in ways that have never been possible.
HOUSLEY: And when it comes to music, innovations like Blocks puts a recording studio in your hands, and even vinyl has managed to go high tech with Crosby adapting 45s to work right along with the jukebox straight out of ""Happy Days.""
CHRIS BLACK, SOUND LEISURE DIRECTOR: It's the best of both worlds, really. You've got everything that looks cool, sounds cool, and you've then got -- get your phone off and stream whatever you want through it. So what else do you want?

HOUSLEY: And drones are everywhere, all shapes, sizes, prices, including this one. The coolest one we found, the hover camera passport, 13 mega pixel pictures, 4K video. And when you want to go, you just walk up, grab it, fold it up. And then Bret, in this case, on my scooter, I am riding off in the sunset. Back to you.
(LAUGHTER)
BAIER: Does he look like he is having fun or what? I'm going to have to get one of those hovercraft things. Thank you, Adam.
A major plan of attack that did nothing to change the actual vote tally. The intel community is more confident though about Russia's actions before the U.S. election. The all-star panel weighs in on all of this and what we learned from today's hearing.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
JAMES CLAPPER, NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE DIRECTOR: They did not change any vote tallies or anything of that sort. Certainly the intelligence community can't gauge the impact it had on the choices the electorate made. There is no way for us to gauge that. This was a multifaceted campaign, so the hacking was only one part of it. And it also entailed classical propaganda, disinformation, fake news.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Does that continue?
CLAPPER: Yes.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
BAIER: The national intelligence director on Capitol Hill today in front of the Senate Armed Services committee. That intel report is complete. It's been briefed to President Obama. It will be briefed to president- elect Trump tomorrow. An unclassified version will be released next week.
Meantime, there was some pushback on the president-elect tweets about one certain person, Julian Assange.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
CLAIRE MCCASKILL, (D) SENATE ARMED SERVICES COMMITTEE: The notion that the soon-elected leader of this country would put Julian Assange on a pedestal, no matter whether you are a Republican or a Democrat, there should be howls. And mark my word, if the roles were reversed, there would be howls from the Republican side of the aisle. Thank you Mr. Chairman.
SEN. JOHN MCCAIN, (R) ARIZONA: Thank you for that nonpartisan comment.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
BAIER: That got some laughs. The president-elect was not laughing on tweeter. ""The dishonest media likes saying that I am in agreement with Julian Assange. Wrong. I simply state what he states. It is for the people,"" continuing, ""to make up their minds as to the truth. The media lies to make it look like I am against intelligence when, in fact, I am a big fan.""
That's where we will start with our panel, Mollie Hemingway, senior editor at ""The Federalist,"" A.B. Stoddard, associate editor at ""Real Clear Politics,"" and syndicated columnist Charles Krauthammer. Charles?
CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER, SYNDICATED COLUMNIST: Well, I think the big mistake he made was to quote Assange, and he sort of had to walk it back. He never admits error, but it is a mistake to quote somebody who clearly is an enemy of the United States, who we know has endangered the lives of people, particularly in Afghanistan and abroad who worked with us and risked their lives. Their lives are now at risk as a result of what Assange has done. So I'm not sure bringing him in is a good idea.
Look, there is no question that the Obama administration has trumped up this issue that it ignored for eight-and-a-half years, particularly the last year and a half, as a way to introduce some doubt in the minds of the electorate about the legitimacy of the Trump victory. But that may be true, but nonetheless, I think it is a mistake for Trump to play into this. He should simply stay out and let it play out. Republicans and Democrats want to know the extent of this as a way to prevent it in the future. I don't think, in the end, it really harms Trump. But the attention he has given it has put in the focus on it to the extent that people are going to ask, why is he so defensive about it?
BAIER: Mollie, what was striking was the Republicans on this committee and what they were saying about Russia, the threat from Russia, the perception about that. Clearly there is some difference in the approach between the president-elect and senior Republicans on Capitol Hill.
MOLLIE HEMINGWAY, ""THE FEDERALIST"": In one sense. In another sense, there's actually a lot of agreements. There is agreement that Russians are meddling in the election and they are going to try and meddle in the way we do things.
BAIER: Let me interrupt you. We want to make clear every time we say it that it is not actually affecting the vote tally in the election, but the lead up to the election and hacking around it.
HEMINGWAY: Right. And it is good to point that out because in fact a new poll showed that over half of Democrats actually believe that Russians did hack into the voting totals and affected the vote totals, which is not true.
But Russians want to undermine our confidence in our institution, and that's why this whole debate is so interesting because you have people on both sides actually playing into that. One of the worst things you can do is actually decrease confidence in how our elections are being done. So President Obama, who has had eight years of failure, or failed at the reset, who mocked Mitt Romney and other critics for saying Russia was serious threat, now that he's heading out, now he wants to bring down the hammer down on Russia, and we're worried about president-elect Trump being too political in his posture towards Russia? It looks very much also like the other side is having trouble.
BAIER: A.B., when president-elect Trump gets this briefing tomorrow, listening to those officials today and their confidence and they are sticking by that assessment, how do you think this place?
A.B. STODDARD, ASSOCIATE EDITOR, REAL CLEAR POLITICS: Well, that is really the problem for the Republicans on Capitol Hill. What you heard in the last couple days of sort of this final, public break, where they don't want to actually be critical of the things that Trump says about Putin or even the he is knocking the intelligence community. He has picked an official fight with them that started two weeks ago, sort of the day before he nominated Rex Tillerson for secretary of state. And he has really put them in an untenable situation.
So while they are upset with him on several issues that they are staying silent about, his refusal to divest, his crony capitalism deal of the day where he picks on a company and makes them keep jobs here or whatever, this is the one thing where he has pushed them into a corner.
So what you heard them say today both on the record and background is tomorrow he has got to come out and say something that is judicious and measured and presidential after this meeting. You can be skeptical of the intelligence, but the antagonism with which he has treated this community on this issue is really over-the-top, and they are expecting some kind of response that is a change tomorrow.
BAIER: Isn't the nuance, though, which we obviously don't get in 140 characters, Charles, that he has a problem with the leadership of intelligence. The John Brennans, the Clappers, who have been caught in several instances over the years not essentially being forthright about different things and looking, at least, like they are political, and that the problem is at the leadership level and not the men and women of the intelligence community who are doing the work to try to keep the country safe.
KRAUTHAMMER: That is a perfectly legitimate distinction, and we have been on the panel and elsewhere critical of a lot of the leaders who have been appointed by Obama, and they have politicized intelligence, and we know about that as a matter of fact.
But nonetheless, the way it has been interpreted, if you are going to use Twitter, then you have to be aware that you can't be subtle and your message can be misunderstood. But I do think on one issue, which is the idea he is going to reorganize or cut back their powers or get his revenge by looking again at how the DNI, the director of national intelligence, how the office -- it's a ridiculous issue. He's a new administration. The DNI was and invention of the 9/11 Commission. It has been 15 years. It is worth a look. Has it worked, has it not? And the administration ought to come in and to question every agency, and intelligence is no exception. It's not sacred on that count.
BAIER: To you point, Sean Spicer, incoming White House press secretary, addressing this ""Wall Street Journal"" article, very detailed about tearing up essentially and reworking, restructuring the intelligence community. Listen. OK.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
SEAN SPICER, SENIOR TRUMP TRANSITION AIDE: These reports are false. All transition activities are for information gathering purposes and all discussions are tentative, but I want to reiterate, there is no truth to this idea of restructuring the intelligence community infrastructure. It is 100 percent false.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
BAIER: Mollie?
HEMINGWAY: It seems the Trump administration wanted to walk back that we're hearing that they might revamp these agencies. That is actually disappointing to me because I think we do need to revamp these agencies. We do have a problem with a highly political intelligence mechanism in our government, and it needs major reform. And this is a problem that goes back. It's not just this administration. It goes back decades. You look at how ""Foreign Policy"" magazine, which is no conservative publication, said in 2013 that there was a huge problem with politicization of these intelligence agencies.
Every other country knew that Syria was using chemical weapons, and our people didn't put it out there because they were worried because they know President Obama had made that one of his redlines and they didn't want to publicly go against him. Listening to what DNI Clapper said today, and in 2013 he lied in front of Congress when he asked if we were collecting data on hundreds of millions of Americans. He said we weren't doing it. That was false. And Senator Wyden, to whom he told this, knew it was false. So we are listening to perjurer's, we have all these problems with all this politicization. I really hope that the administration does look at the problems we have and think about what we need to do to reform this so we can trust what our intelligence agencies are saying.
BAIER: I want to go to the other panel after the break. Quickly, the DNI coming in who Donald Trump wants is the former senator from Indiana Dan Coats. Interesting, A.B., that Ben Sasse, current senator, who has obviously been no big fan of the president-elect in the campaign, tweeted this, ""There are many reasons to love the choice of Dan Coats for DNI including that he is steely eyed about the fact that Putin is no friend.""
STODDARD: Right. This is a very comforting picked for Republicans at the end of a long couple of days, and Dan Coats obviously has everyone's respect on both sides of the aisle.
BAIER: Next up, we will discuss how President Obama is viewing the legacy he is leaving behind.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
BARACK OBAMA, (D) PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Even as we have suffered terrible attacks here at home, from Boston to Orlando, no foreign terrorist organization has successfully planned and executed an attack on our homeland these past eight years.
What I can say with confidence is that we have done works. That I can prove.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
BAIER: The president putting out a memo today and talking yesterday about success, he says, on the terror front, on the economic front, on a lot of fronts. We're back with our panel. Mollie, what about this?
HEMINGWAY: Obama is absolutely delusional about what his own legacy is. His legacy can be summed up in three words, which is President Donald Trump. Americans did not vote for Donald Trump because they thought Obama's presidency was a success. They voted for him because they think it has been a tremendous failure. This farewell tour that he's going on where he is saying that he hasn't had any scandals in eight years when everything from their actual body trails from Benghazi and ATF, lying about the Iran deal, the IRS targeting political enemies. This is just delusional.
BAIER: A.B.
STODDARD: I do think the victory tour is really lengthy and no one is really listening. I think that Democrats who really love Obama personally are going to miss him. I don't know they are going to be hanging onto every word of his speech in Chicago next week or reading these memos.
The one thing I do hear in his comments that I think is defensible is that anyone who came in that economic free fall, and because we are not Venezuela, comes up and says, hey, we came out of a hole. When he says I have proof that everything is great, that's not true. But he feels defensive about starting with the recession. The rest about terrorism when Americans are so afraid and we've had attacks here on our soil is not convincing. The health care law is a complete mess, and he knows it, and contributed to Hillary's loss. So I think it is going to fall on a lot of deaf ears.
BAIER: Speaking of health care, the president-elect tweeting ""Democrats led by head clown Chuck Schumer know how bad Obamacare is, what a mess they're in, and instead of working to fix it they do the typical political thing and blame. The fact is Obamacare was a lie from the beginning keep your doctor, keep your plan."" Here is vice president Obama responding essentially to that on PBS.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
JOE BIDEN, (D) VICE PRESIDENT: Grow up, Donald. Grow up. Time to be an adult. You're president. You got to do something. Show us what you have.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
BAIER: Charles?
KRAUTHAMMER: Joe Biden unleashed. It's a pity he will be gone because it would be interesting and fun to watch.
I think the Republicans are taking on a big task. The minute they do anything on Obamacare, and that will be within a few weeks, they own it. They are going to own the entire health care system. People are not going to distinguish as they did not in the Obama years between what did you change and what was unchanged in the health care system. It is a gestalt, the idea of how it is working. It is working terribly. Obamacare is collapsing and it would on its own. But it will continue to, but now it will all be attributed to the Republicans. They better have something ready to go to substitute or at least a patchwork to get them between a and b, because otherwise they are going to suffer politically on healthcare the way that Obama and Democrats have continually for eight years.
BAIER: Mollie, this farewell address on Tuesday, what do you think it will be?
HEMINGWAY: I think it will be much of what we have seen for the last eight years with President Obama being one of his best fans, but also it will a time for everybody to go ahead and close out and think about what they like about President Obama and be looking for to the next era.
BAIER: Quickly, A.B.?
STODDARD: I think he's going to say the same thing he said at his year end presser and in this memo that everything is great and he has proof. And like I said, a few devoted Democrats will watch this and that's probably it.
BAIER: Something tells me we will get more from you at some point to the farewell address.
A note about this particular day when we come back.
BAIER: Finally, tonight, we usually take a moment on this day to say thank you for viewing SPECIAL REPORT. On this day, eight years ago, I took over the anchor chair on this show from my mentor and friend, Brit Hume. Here was a look at that day. Eight years goes fast. I looked a little different. I think that might be the same tie, I'm not sure. I did not plan that tonight. But it is the same tie. Yes.
What has not changed is the commitment of SPECIAL REPORT staff and the correspondents who makes this show but it is. They are the people who make SPECIAL REPORT special. Thank you for watching. Thank you for making is number one in every one of those eight years. And as a start year nine, I promise you 2017 will be one to watch.
Thanks for inviting us into your home every night. That is it for this SPECIAL REPORT, fair, balanced, and still unafraid. ""Tucker Carlson Tonight"" starts right now. Tucker is moving to 9:00 p.m. Congratulations, Tucker. And Martha MacCallum headed to 7:00 p.m. See, 2017 is already one to watch."
0	24	 25 von 72	Fox News Network	January 5, 2017 Thursday	 THE FIVE	 5:00 PM EST		"GREG GUTFELD, THE FIVE SHOW CO-HOST: Hi, I'm Greg Gutfeld with Kimberly Guilfoyle, Juan Williams, Jesse Watters, and chicken belly flopped in a shot glass, Dana Perino, The Five.
Four ghouls are in jail after posting a Facebook live video where they tortured a mentally disabled young man, kicking and beating up the tied-up special-needs victim, burning him with cigarettes, cutting his scalp. He is in the hospital after being found dazed on the street. On the video, you can hear the shouts of F Donald Trump and F white people.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: [bleep] Donald Trump. [bleep] white people, boy. [bleep] them. [bleep]. 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Goof.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: [bleep].
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: My sister said that's not funny, y'all.
[bleep].
(END VIDEO CLIP)
GUTFELD: So that sounds like a hate crime, yet, for some, it is still a debate.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
SYMONE SANDERS, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST: We cannot go about classifying things of the hate crime. Motives here matter. We start going around any time someone says something or does something really egregious, really bad, and sickening in this instance in connection with the president-elect or Donald Trump or even President Obama for that matter because of their political leanings. That is slippery territory. That is not a hate crime. Hate crimes are because of a person's racial ethnicity, their religion, their gender, their disability. It is your political leanings because someone doesn't like your political leanings. That is not a hate crime.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
GUTFELD: Translation. These days a hate crime must always validate assumptions about a bigoted America, meaning it must be purchased created by angry whites who voted for Trump. And then of course later, proven false. But what if in this one, here the themes actually filmed any proof. They are not just evil but they're stupid. It is black on white crime, there is no hijab on the victim. So this doesn't fit media narrative. That is my hate crime law sucks. Everyone ends up obsessing over whether the assault qualifies or not rather than focusing on the crime itself. But evil should unite us in horror, not divide us over classification. And we shouldn't really not pay attention to what thugs thought, and let it our response, better that we define ourselves by our own clear eyed punishment. Because a violent crime is a hate crime no matter who the victim is.
The last point, what about those who watch this on Facebook who didn't call the cops? What do you make of them? I mean, the only silver lining here is that crimes like these still managed to repulse us, but what if they didn't? So, Dana, after these things happened, they go over the hate crime classifications. It doesn't qualify, does it not? It is like, why? Why not just focus on the damn crime?
DANA PERINO, THE FIVE SHOW CO-HOST: I have always felt that way about the hate crime legislation. I have always been interested in Kimberly's take, we will get that in a second. Because, as a prosecutor, there are reasons you might want to have a hate crime designation. But in this case, I think that the potential for human aggression and depravity is astonishing, and it is moments like this where it doesn't matter to me what color they were. It was such a horrible, disgusting crime and obviously, all of our hearts go out to the victim and his family. I do think that last night's debate, immediately after the story broke on cable and on Twitter, it just became something like the team sport aspect. All of a sudden now, we have to choose sides about whether this is a hate crime, and that becomes a debate. I think all of the things that the sound bite you play, all the things they listed as to -- these are reasons it would not be a hate crime, if you're disabled, political leanings. So the distinction gets completely watered down, unless it fits their narrative.
GUTFELD: Kimberly, can I show you -- this is something come up from the Presser today in which they talked about the hate crime requirements?
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: For a hate crime, what specifically are you looking at?
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Well, again, his diminished mental capacity, the fact that they tied him up, the obvious racial quotes that they post live on Facebook. I mean, taking the totality of the circumstances, the state's attorney agreed with us. We sought hate crime charges and they agreed.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Just to be clear, you mentioned the mental capacity. With heavy emphasis or the strong point of a hate crime or was it the racial comments?
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It's half a dozen of one, six of the other.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
GUTFELD: So, Kimberly, my point is, with all of these awful things going on, isn't it obvious that it is just hate, why do need the extra.
KIMBERLY GUILFOYLE, THE FIVE SHOW CO-HOST: It is important so you properly classify it. It also involves that it has extra sentencing enhancement when you have a hate crime that is charged. In this case, they have a very solid case. There are number of charges they can make, they have charged with aggravated kidnapping and false imprisonment, a number of things depending on the state how they classify and what they call the different violations. These are all felonies. This is a very serious case. If I was a prosecutor I would charge it as a hate crime. It does meet the requisite qualifications in that particular state. They were very specific in their language. You don't even have to rely on the victim's word for it, they have it on tape. You play that to a jury, do you think they are going to be sympathetic to these individuals of pure hate and evil in their hearts? There are a number of ways they can get it, and the officer and the DA is specifying that they can do it because of the racial motivation. Then they are very clear as white people and then, also Donald Trump and the fact that they picked on somebody who was special-needs and a disabled man, that also qualifies. So this isn't even a question. For those who are saying this, it's because they don't know what they are talking about and haven't prosecuted these cases like I have.
GUTFELD: So it is basically icing on the cake in terms of punishment? I don't think you need to -- I think you should go as severe as possible, but hate crime is great because you can add another.
JESSE WATTERS, THE FIVE SHOW CO-HOST: Yeah. You can add another five years on it. It's funny how this media has the huge appetite to cover hate crimes, but when it is black on white, all of a sudden, they're not hungry anymore. They don't want to touch it. Everybody knew it was a hate crime. The only people who didn't call it a hate crime in the beginning is because they didn't want to call it a hate crime. Don Lemon said this isn't evil. I don't know, if this isn't evil, I don't know what is. CNN called it a beating. This looks like torture to me.
GUILFOYLE: Yeah.
WATTERS: And the White House today refused to even weigh in on whether this was a hate crime, because they said it was an active investigation. How many active investigations has the White House weighed in on? And we know if this was on the other foot here, if these were white Trump supporters doing this to a young black disabled men.
GUILFOYLE: Oh, forget it.
WATTERS: . the president would be weighing in, Sharpton, Jackson, Trump would have to answer for this, white America would have to answer for this. It is just sad because when you hold different races to different behavioral standards, I believe that is more prejudiced, because that is almost assuming that certain races aren't equal. And that is what I have a problem with.
GUTFELD: What do you make, Juan, of the facts that like -- OK, they found out about this because the neighbor called in, because the criminals have gone down and bashed in the door, people watching on Facebook, I still haven't figured out if anybody who watched it actually called the police. That kind of creeps me out, right?
JUAN WILLIAMS, THE FIVE SHOW CO-HOST: Yeah. I mean, obviously here in New York, I forget the name of the woman who was being attacked, it was many decades ago.
GUTFELD: Yeah.
WILLIAMS: And people said no one came to her aid, even though it was evident. I'm not sure people believed that they were watching something.
(CROSSTALK)
WILLIAMS: No, no, it was another one, even before that, where somebody in an apartment building was being abused and everybody knew it, everybody said they could hear her scream.
GUTFELD: It is an urban legend now when they found out later that they did do something. But I get your point.
WILLIAMS: Yeah. I'm not sure people watching actually knew it was in fact real as opposed to something that was faked. But to come back and join the earlier conversation with Jesse, I don't even question about the hateful and racist nature of this crime, but where I would object was, there is some distinction to be made, if the shoe was on the other foot, if this was a black person being abused by white people that there would have been an outcry. We have instances where that happens, I don't think there is any immediate shouting. In fact, there was a case where a black kid was taken by some whites and abused by a hanger. I didn't hear about it until today.
(CROSSTALK)
WATTERS: Well, they barely covered this on the broadcast news last night.
WILLIAMS: Are you kidding? I heard about this last night.
(CROSSTALK)
WATTERS: Most of the wire copy didn't even mention the race of the purpose.
GUILFOYLE: Correct.
(CROSSTALK)
GUILFOYLE: Tucker Carlson had this on at 7:00.
(CROSSTALK)
WILLIAMS: It right, I heard about it right away.
(CROSSTALK)
WILLIAMS: OK. But I am out of my mind on lots of topics, but as I said to you, in reading about this, I see where this happened to a black kid.
(CROSSTALK)
GUILFOYLE: A classmate of one of the suspects, held for a minimum of at least 24 to 48 hours and his scalp was cut open repeatedly. So I think everyone knew this wasn't a joke or staged.
WILLIAMS: I don't know that. People watching, apparently, to your point, Greg, I'm not sure if they understood the horror, that this was real, this was blood.
(CROSSTALK)
GUILFOYLE: People commenting on Facebook, this is not funny, this is awful.
(CROSSTALK)
WILLIAMS: But, anyway, whole issue is one of, is this legitimate in terms of people saying this is a hate crime. I don't see that this needs to be an argument about the hate crime. Although I remember with some intensity what happened to George W. Bush when he was governor with Texas, and the speller was dragged by some whites behind the truck and the NAACP went after the governor at that time and said that he was not sufficiently upset because it was white people who did it. I thought it was totally illegitimate. It was an argument about hate crime statutes. It wasn't an argument about the horrific nature of the crime.
GUTFELD: Yeah.
WILLIAMS: And so, it gets used on both sides. And I think it weakens It's us as an American people because it is not like Dylann Roof doesn't exist going into a black turf.
GUTFELD: Right.
(CROSSTALK)
WILLIAMS: . people responded by saying oh, yeah, it is a reason for more racial, hate.
(CROSSTALK)
WATTERS: OK. Are there going to be satellite trucks parked outside this trial in Chicago like there were at Dylann Roof's trial? I doubt it.
WILLIAMS: Oh, you doubt it?
WATTERS: I will make you a bet right now. This story gets much less coverage than Dylann Roof.
WILLIAMS: You know what I think, Jesse? I think in this era, right now, there is so much racial tension and some of them attached to Trump, it is going to get a ton of attention.
(CROSSTALK)
GUTFELD: I mean, Dylann Roof killed people. He killed nine people.
(CROSSTALK)
GUTFELD: I would keep him in a different -- as heinous as this is, that was.
GUILFOYLE: Right. And to try to tie it to Donald Trump and say this is going to be tied to him because racial things are tied to him. This is outrageous. No, this is a hate crime committed by four eager suspects who actually said they hope to this video would go viral and held him there for an extended period of time.
WILLIAMS: They mentioned Donald Trump's name. That's why I said it.
(CROSSTALK)
GUTFELD: I have got to tease Juan for telling me to go. Coming up, intel chiefs grilled on Capitol Hill over Russia's meddling in our elections. It happened today. What they said about the impact, and how it had an impact on the vote and if the cyber attack order came directly from Putin himself. More on this.
PERINO: Today, two top intelligence officials testified on the Hill to defend findings that Russia waged cyber attacks to interfere with the 2016 presidential election. National Intelligence director James Clapper and NSA chief Mike Rogers, head of the U.S. Cyber Command say they have never seen a more direct campaign by Russia to tamper with our election and they point to the very top.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Do you think this was approved at the highest level of government in Russia? Generally speaking, is that right?
JAMES CLAPPER, NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE DIRECTOR: That is what we said.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: OK. Who is the highest level of government?
CLAPPER: Well, the highest as President Putin.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
PERINO: Good question. Does the hacking at the DNC and Democratic officials actually change the outcome of the election? Listen here.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
JOHN MCCAIN, U.S. SENATOR: Really, what we're talking about, if they succeeded in changing the results of an election, which none of us believe they were, that would have to constitute an attack on the United States of America because of the effects if they had succeeded. Would you agree with that?
CLAPPER: First, we cannot say it -- they did not change any vote tallies or anything of that sort.
(CROSSTALK)
CLAPPER: We have no way of gauging the impact that certainly the intelligence community can't gauge the impact it had on the choices the electorate made.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
PERINO: So that is basically what we thought they would say, which is that Russia was trying some funny business. It was unprecedented, but nobody can say it actually had an impact.
WATTERS: Russia provided hack material to a third person to walk to WikiLeaks. So all of you Assange kissers who were saying they didn't get it from Russia, duh, we knew that. We knew that. It came from a third party. But I don't even care about that. I don't care about that. I don't think this is about phishing or hacking anymore. During the Cold War, We have mutual assured destruction like if you blew us up, we blow you up. We don't have any policy on this stuff. And when they come after our power grid, which means if they get our hospitals, if they get our banks, if everything shuts down and the United States has a week with no food, no nothing, what do we do?
WATTERS: No food.
GUTFELD: No food. They shut down the power. No food.
(CROSSTALK)
GUTFELD: My point is this, you have to have deterrence. We have to have a nukeable offense. Say, if you attack our power grid, we will nuke you.
WATTERS: They don't have food in Russia anyway. So what are we going to do?
GUTFELD: I'm talking about North Korea, any kind of agent, sanctions aren't going to scare anybody. We can think about retaliation. We have to think about prevention. How do you make it clear to these people that if they do this, they all die, because sanctions isn't going to do it, and retaliation with cyber attacks isn't going to do it. You have to threaten them militarily. That's it.
PERINO: This is an astonishing thing, Kimberly, today. You have government officials saying that threats are increasing the cyber world. We have a lot of competition. But what we don't have is deterrence and that we have a lot of work to do. This isn't a new problem and probably one of the reasons people are frustrated with Washington. In the last eight years, they really can't point to having something like Greg is talking about.
GUILFOYLE: Right. But I think this just really stresses and emphasizes the point that they need to overhaul and make some serious changes, so that actually we can do something about preventing this in the future. And also, then, there is a healthy bit of fear of reprisal and action back towards them if they are going to engage in this kind of behavior. Obviously, we don't want Russia, North Korea, China, any other state agents coming against the United States, trying to influence and interfere in our elections. We can agree on when that. Obviously, Russia had something to do with this, they are behind it, it seems so. We also know clearly from what was presented today that no one can articulate or specify in any way that this affected the outcome of our election. No one can say that.
(CROSSTALK)
GUILFOYLE: So there you go. We take it from there. What steps do you take? Continue to do the investigation. Then let president-elect 45, Donald Trump, make the call.
PERINO: Speaking of Donald Trump, the NSA director was asked about Donald Trump's recent feud, I guess you could say, with the intelligence community over this issue. Here is what he had to say.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: How has the president-elect at least encouraged dismissive attitude towards the intelligence community broadly impacted morale in your agencies?
CLAPPER: Well, I haven't done a climate survey, but I hardly think it helps it.
MIKE ROGERS, NSA DIRECTOR: I don't want to lose good, motivated people who want to help serve this nation because they are feeling they are not generating value to help this nation.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
PERINO: Today, Donald Trump tweeted, the dishonest media likes saying that I am in agreement with Julian Assange. Wrong. I simply state what he states, it is for the people to make up their own minds and to truth, the media lies to make it look like I'm against intelligence, when in fact, I'm a big fan and intelligence wasn't close. Jesse, what do you make of that?
WATTERS: Well, I think what Trump say, intelligence is his most important quality. He loves intelligence, he loves intelligent people, he even loves the uninformed unintelligent people. I am so sick of this story, I am bored of it. I think it is like the dog ate my homework, it is the Koch brothers, then it is Fox News, it is big oil, it is Wall Street. They are kind of masquerading the fact that Hillary and Obama got embarrassed. If someone robbed your house, would you for six weeks straight tell the entire community, I got robbed? I mean, it makes America look weak. We are trying to go after Russia. Russia is trying to go after us. These things happen. We lost this round. I just, you know, get an alarm system and maybe go after the guy who did it. I won't advertise to the whole world that we just got smoked. It's embarrassing, I'm sick of it. It is the stupidest story.
(CROSSTALK)
WATTERS: And Podesta gave the email and password to the guy who tried to hack him. That's not hacking, that is just dumb.
GUILFOYLE: Password.
(CROSSTALK)
WATTERS: Password is password. I don't get it.
GUILFOYLE: OK, your password, Juan.
WILLIAMS: At Fox.
(CROSSTALK)
WILLIAMS: I wish that would work. In fact, yesterday, you said, I think in a break, you have a system.
GUTFELD: I have a system.
WILLIAMS: I spent 45 minutes.
(CROSSTALK)
PERINO: Then it says to put it in, you put it in again, it says rejected.
WILLIAMS: Exactly. I know this well.
(CROSSTALK)
WILLIAMS: Let me just say, I think this is a bigger story than Jesse wants to make it. Because he just wants to make it political. I think this is a real story. Like today, the real news to my mind was, the Wall Street Journal reported that the president-elect's team wants to restructure the entire intelligence community.
GUTFELD: Didn't they walk that back?
WILLIAMS: No. Trump said, the tweet that we heard, which is the phony media or the lying media, or something.
PERINO: The lying media.
(CROSSTALK)
PERINO: . said that the story was overwritten.
WILLIAMS: Overblown.
PERINO: Overblown. And I do think that there will be some legitimate reasons to reform some parts of the intelligence committee, but the whole reform. It is probably not going to happen the way that the Wall Street Journal necessarily wrote. But also, unfortunately, it got conflated and connected to the Russia story when I think that revamping the intel world had nothing to do necessarily with this specific issue.
WILLIAMS: Correct. Absolutely right. Because what you have is the proliferation of various agencies to the point where we had to create the director of national intelligence.
PERINO: That has not worked out well.
WILLIAMS: Yeah. There are a lot of loose strings. That guy repeating what this other guy is doing. But to come back to the hard notion here that this is just about politics, I don't think so. I think it really is about abuse of our political structure by a foreign government.
WATTERS: Why isn't Obama doing something about it as a lame-duck?
(CROSSTALK)
WILLIAMS: You know what's interesting, Jesse?
WATTERS: Yes.
WILLIAMS: The left is still angry at Obama for not having gone harder after the Russians when it was first recognized. And this has been recognized for months.
(CROSSTALK)
WILLIAMS: You know what he said?
WATTERS: Yeah.
WILLIAMS: You don't want to overreact to these people. We don't want people to think they have the ability to influence the election.
(CROSSTALK)
WATTERS: Now, we're going to expel diplomats?
WILLIAMS: Let me just say, the other part of this, I don't see that Donald Trump benefits from making enemies in the intelligence community.
(CROSSTALK)
WATTERS: That hurts morale.
GUTFELD: OK. But we got to split this issue. I agree with you, the Russian hacking thing is not the story. The story is our future when it comes to technology. All those men have to go home and do their homework and talk about what attacks could happen. It probably is not going to be Russia. It might be an isolated agent. It could be terrorists. But we have to think about, what is the deterrence, how do we make it so it never happens? It is about our threat. We don't have the threat anymore. What we did with the Cold War is the nuclear bomb. We got to think that way again, sorry.
(CROSSTALK)
PERINO: We got to go.
(CROSSTALK)
WILLIAMS: You know what, Putin, you are really smart not to respond to what President Obama has done in terms of sanctions. What kind of message is that?
(CROSSTALK)
PERINO: All right. Coming up, I just want to keep going. So much for civility in the battle over Obamacare, turning into a war of words. President-elect Trump calling Senate majority leader a quote clown and Chuck Schumer fires right back, when The Five returns.
GUILFOYLE: The fight to repeal Obamacare is underway, and it is already ugly.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The Republican plan to cut healthcare wouldn't make America great again, it would make America sick again.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: So make America sick again? Is that with the Republicans want to do?
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: All that will do is make America sick again.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
GUILFOYLE: Well, that triggered this response from President-elect Trump. Quote, ""The Democrats, led by head clown Chuck Schumer, know how bad Obamacare is and what a mess they are in. Instead of working to fix it, they do the typical political thing and blame. The fact is, Obamacare was a lie from the beginning."" Quote, ""'Keep your doctor, keep your plan.' It's time for Republicans and Democrats to get together and come up with a health care plan that really works, much less expensive and far better.""
Minority Leader Schumer fired right back earlier.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
SCHUMER: I say to the president-elect that this is serious, serious stuff. People's health is at stake, and people's lives are at stake.
Now, we understand that President-elect Trump is in a difficult spot, that Republicans are in a difficult spot. They want to repeal ACA and have no idea how to replace it. But instead of calling names, president-elect should roll up his sleeves and show us a replacement plan that will cover the 20 million Americans who gained coverage.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
GUILFOYLE: Oh, my goodness. Oh, Chuck, please pick up your head.
PERINO: I know. Three days in a row.
GUILFOYLE: I can't stand it anymore. Sister Jean-Marie, at Our Lady of Mercy Grammar School, would have been like, ""Oh, Chuck, this is unacceptable. You must enunciate. You must make eye contact to be a good communicator."" That's what I have to say.
Dana, do you agree, my speech and debate -- yes.
PERINO: Totally agree. It's three days in a row we've had soundbites from him. It's like, ""Whoa. I do not want to miss Harry Reid."" I do not miss Harry Reid.
I think the Democrats have come to the understanding and the realization that the death spiral of Obamacare is upon us and that there is nothing they can do to stop it. And so they are going to help accelerate the demise of it and pin it on Donald Trump. And that's why they have come out with this thing where everybody says the exact same thing, ""Make America sick again, make America sick again,"" which people will get sick of real quick. Because...
GUILFOYLE: Yes, speaking of.
PERINO: Most people, I think, out there in the world want it repealed, because they want a better system, and they want to have it more affordable. And they want to have something they can rely on, which is what they don't feel like they have now.
GUILFOYLE: Right. Jesse, why is better a bad thing?
WATTERS: Well, it can't get any worse. Because it's just (UNINTELLIGIBLE) upon us. It's like the patient has gangrene. And the Republicans are about there; they're about to amputate this thing. And Donald Trump is saying, ""Whoa, whoa, whoa, you know, we're just trying to make the patient better. Why are we getting the blame for amputating this thing? And that's what you have to do sometimes. You just have to cut off the leg and rip the Band-Aid off quickly.
And the Democrats caused this problem.
GUTFELD: I don't want you to be my doctor.
WATTERS: No one does. No one does.
GUILFOYLE: That would be an example of Obamacare right there.
WATTERS: I know, it's blame shifting. And the Democrats caused this, and Republicans are trying to shift the blame. They just try have to make a soft landing for people that had it and then quick relief for the employers that are getting hammered.
I don't trust Washington politicians to solve this. It's going to be a mess. I don't think anybody is smart enough in Washington to fix this problem quickly. It's going to be a disaster either way you write it.
But Chuck Schumer -- I love the Schumer clown slang. This is like the new ""Lyin' Ted,"" the new ""Crooked Hillary."" It's delightful. I really get a kick out of this.
But the more, I think, we see Chuck Schumer, and the more we see Nancy Pelosi as the spokespeople for the Democratic Party, I think that's great news for Republicans and Donald Trump.
GUILFOYLE: Yes. Bad. Bad for your team, Juan. So sorry.
WILLIAMS: I don't think it's bad at all.
Here is the -- here is the other side of this story, which is that I think Democrats are saying, ""Hey, you're right. Twenty million people lose their health insurance. Let's see what you say to them."" OK, you can come back.
WATTERS: Hasn't President Obama already gotten them off those plans?
WILLIAMS: No
WATTERS, Yes, he did.
WILLIAMS: But I think there are consequences for people -- and we discussed at this table -- for people who are individuals. There were individuals in the private market, who saw they couldn't keep their doctors, who saw their premiums increase. And they're the ones who are aggrieved and have legitimate grievance. And small business. There were individuals in the private who saw they couldn't keep their doctors, who set their premiums increase, and they were the ones who were aggrieved and had the legitimate grievances, and small businesses and small business owners.
WATTERS: You think Obamacare is doing well? And you want it to continue?
WILLIAMS: I think...
WATTERS: Is that what you're saying?
WILLIAMS: Yes, very much.
WATTERS: You like it?
WILLIAMS: I do. I think...
WATTERS: Do you like the premium increases? You must have a lot of money, Juan, because most people can't afford that.
WILLIAMS: The fact is, premium increases are less than they were predicted to be.
WATTERS: Juan, it advertised that he was supposed to reduce premiums, and now they're skyrocketing 116...
WILLIAMS: They have not even reached the level at which they were predicted to be. But let me just make this point.
GUILFOYLE: OK. But can we get an Obamacare timeout?
WILLIAMS: I can't make a point? I'm not allowed?
GUILFOYLE: But I have -- I have someone who's sick and needs medical attention -- Greg.
GUTFELD: I'm more offended by the fact that we keep referring to the term ""clown"" as an insult. Being a clown is a...
WILLIAMS: Is scary.
GUTFELD: No. It's an accomplishment.
GUILFOYLE: Weren't they banned?
GUTFELD: You make -- you make children happy. Everybody loves a birthday clown. They make balloon animals. A lot of our most famous loved Americans started out as clowns, like Willard Scott, Willard Scott, Willard Scott. Lou Dobbs. Lou Dobbs...
GUILFOYLE: Oh! No, no, no. No, no, no.
GUTFELD: By the way, if this is -- I hope this is the extent of the conflicts that we have. If we have four years of these cat fights, I mean, that's great. It's like watching four years of Bravo. This is going to be good. If our conflicts are small and catty, that's good.
WILLIAMS: But that's not small.
GUILFOYLE: Why is it good?
GUTFELD: Yes, it is.
WILLIAMS: Health care?
GUTFELD: I mean, you know what -- well, it's almost over.
WILLIAMS: Well, it's almost over. My point to you, by the way, earlier that I couldn't say was that, in fact, Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, I think that's why the Democrats think, ""Oh, if you have trouble with this, Republicans, we'll see how the voters react. Go right ahead.""
WATTERS: Yes. You guys lost the last election because of Obamacare.
GUILFOYLE: All right, we've got to go. I'm keeping the clicker on the word count, and I think you can figure out at home who's winning the bingo.
Coming up, President Obama still attempting to defend his legacy as he prepares to leave the White House. His farewell letter to the American people when ""The Five"" returns.
WILLIAMS: In 15 days, President Obama will leave the White House, and he's proud of what he's accomplished over the last eight years. In an exit memo to Americans, he says, quote, ""By so many measures, our country is stronger and more prosperous than it was when we started, a situation I'm proud to leave for my successor.""
Newt Gingrich has a very different assessment.
GUTFELD: Newt!
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
NEWT GINGRICH, FORMER SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE: This is like one of those dolls that you watch the air come out of it, and it shrinks and shrinks. By the time you get to Easter, the Obamacare, the Obama legacy is going to be so small, you're going to need a microscope to find it.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WILLIAMS: Bernie Sanders says the Democratic Party is in bad shape because they've lost so many congressional seats.
GUILFOYLE: Yes, no kidding.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (I), VERMONT: When we have lost the House, when we lost the Senate, when we have lost the White House, when we have lost 900 legislative seats, two-thirds of the governor's chairs are now controlled by Republicans, maybe, maybe something is fundamentally wrong with the Democratic Party. And I think, within the Democratic Party, more and more people understand we have to change the dynamics. we have to open the doors to young people, working people. We need to bring a lot more people into the process.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WILLIAMS: So, Dana, there seems to be a difference. Obviously, Republicans don't like Obama. Democrats like Obama. The numbers, in terms of his approval rating, very high at this moment...
PERINO: Yes.
WILLIAMS: ... for a president leaving office. How do you argue, how do you think about, in fact, whether or not he has been a successful president?
PERINO: Well, I think that, when you ask legacy questions, one of my favorite things is what George Bush used to say to me when I would ask him, ""So what do you -- the press is going to ask you what you think your legacy will be.""
And he would say, ""Well, last year, I read three biographies about George Washington, and if historians are still analyzing the first president, than the 43rd doesn't have a lot to worry about, because he'll never know.""
So in Obama's lifetime, he may never know how he is considered. In fact, if you talk to Marlin Fitzwater, who was press secretary to George H.W. Bush, he said on the day that they left in 1993, that he never in a million years thought that people would look so fondly back at that presidency and hold 41 in such high regard.
So it's hard when you're leaving the White House and the opposite party is coming in for you to make the case that you've done such a great job. But he's going to make it. One of the reasons that he wrote a letter like this is so that it can be in his library one day, because he's going to try to write the history first.
WILLIAMS: And in fact, Jesse, what you see is that the Trump people like Newt Gingrich say, ""Hey, you know what? We're going to dismantle, tear apart this man's legacy in a matter of days.""
WATTERS: Yes. They're going to have to start downsizing Obama's presidential library pretty soon. There's not a lot to go in there, Juan.
The only thing he's actually left stronger has been the Republican Party, because domestically, his signature achievement, Obamacare, is going to be reduced to rubble. Internationally, you have the Iran deal. He got troops out of Iraq, and he killed bin Laden. I think only one of those three things is going to stand the test of time.
GUILFOYLE: And he spent a lot of money, 20 trillion in debt.
WATTERS: Yes. So you have the huge debt. You have flat wages. You have weakest recovery since World War II. I think socially maybe probably oversaw a lot of progress, as you guys like to say, on gay marriage and weed and social justice. But I don't know if the country was going at the same pace he was, and I think that was some backlash over that.
You know, Juan, it's sad. I think he will be remembered symbolically as the first black president, and I think that's the main thing that everybody should be most proud of.
WILLIAMS: And Kimberly, he put out this memo that we've been discussing...
GUILFOYLE: Bill Clinton.
WATTERS: That's right, Bill Clinton.
WILLIAMS: ... and he said unemployment's down, right?
GUILFOYLE: Yes.
WILLIAMS: Median income up, GDP...
GUILFOYLE: No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
WILLIAMS: ... federal budget deficit is down.
GUILFOYLE: Median household incomes have dropped over the past seven years.
WILLIAMS: Individual, I think, is what I'm looking at here.
GUILFOYLE: From fifty-seven to fifty-two percent.
WILLIAMS: He talked about the auto industry. Are those legitimate claims?
GUILFOYLE: I mean, I don't know. I've got to go to China to get a car.
WILLIAMS: You've got to go to China?
GUILFOYLE: I mean, are you kidding me? We've been exporting America. We've been -- jobs leaving, money leaving, corporations leaving, because this has been a hostile environment in every shape and form. We're overly regulated. We're overly taxed. And we're like the third highest in general top-margin corporate income tax rate in the world, OK? Thirty- eight point 9-2 percent. This is not anything that's encouraging people to do business here.
That's part of the reason why Donald Trump was elected. When you look at all the exit polls, people talked about the economy. They talked about jobs. They talked about having money in their pockets and their wallets and not being, you know, apprehensive about the future and about the direction of this country.
WILLIAMS: Well, picking up on Kimberly's point...
GUILFOYLE: Obama is personally popular. His policies have not been and have not worked.
WILLIAMS: I was going to say -- I was going to ask you why you had voted for Obama again. And then I realized you didn't vote for Obama this third time. But you didn't -- lots of people say the biggest point of failure for Obama is that, despite his popularity, people didn't vote for his chosen successor.
GUTFELD: He has left America stronger. We have 500 new gender pronouns that we didn't have before. We have a whole new class of grievances. There are more men, millions more men in skinny jeans. I think that's great.
GUILFOYLE: Man buns.
GUTFELD: Man buns everywhere. Video game -- video game usage is way up.
WATTERS: Thanks, Obama.
GUTFELD: Why do we care?
GUILFOYLE: Thanks, Obama.
GUTFELD: Why do we care? He's leaving in two weeks. You know, let him go. It's like bringing up your ex-girlfriend on your honeymoon.
Just say, ""Look, dude, you did a great job. Awesome. You were the best progressive leader I've ever seen in my life."" Two weeks, shake hands, we're all good friends. How's that?
WILLIAMS: In fact, I think Mrs. Clinton is going to shake Donald Trump's hand at the inaugural.
Ahead, a very interesting update on Dan Rather, the former CBS journalist at the center of one of the biggest fake news scandals in American history, now what's he going to do? Stay tuned.
WATTERS: Fake news out there, but this story is actually true, even though it sounds hard to believe. You all know Dan Rather, one of the pioneers of fake news. The former CBS news man was disgraced after a bogus report on former President George W. Bush more than a decade ago.
Want to know what he's up to now? Teaching students about truthful reporting. That's right. Rather is teaching an online course focused on ethics in journalism.
So we found out the first guest lecturer that Rather is going to bring on is going to be ""Rolling Stone"" magazine, OK? So what's going on? Does Dan Rather even remember why he got in trouble?
GUTFELD: His life was so easy back then. There was no competition. You had three channels and PBS. Imagine going to the Cheesecake Factory, and there's meat loaf, meat loaf, and meat loaf.
By the way you know what? He's missing the boat. He should have a dating show called ""Would You Rather?""
GUILFOYLE: That's awesome.
GUTFELD: And the woman is offered either a date with Dan Rather or a date with some other man or woman, because it's 2017, America, but at the end, they'd go, ""Would You Rather?"" And at the end of every show, he just leaves with the girl.
WATTERS: I love it. Dan Rather, if you're listening, look that up.
So it's not even an real university, Dana. It's an online university. It's not even as good as the University of Phoenix.
PERINO: Hey, that's the future. He's 85 years old, and he's on top of the future of education.
I do want to give a shout out to Robert Bluey, who is now at ""The Daily Signal"" and runs that web site at Heritage Foundation. He is the one who broke the story, CNSNews.com, on September 9, 2004, where he said that the documents may have been forged using current word processing programming, according to typography experts. He blew away The New York Times, The Washington Post. Everybody was just following Dan Rather, and it was a blogger, Rob Bluey, who figured it out.
WATTERS: Are you comfortable with Rather as the ombudsman of journalism ethics, Juan?
WILLIAMS: Well, you know, I think Dan Rather is a pretty good journalist, but he made a terrible mistake. And the question is, you know, can they sell this? And I think lots of people would buy the idea of a great name, Dan Rather, CBS, although they've disassociated themselves from him, as someone you can go to and talk to about it in the age of fake news, what's real and not real. But, boy, it open the doors to charges of hypocrisy and double standards. Doesn't it?
GUILFOYLE: Oh, look, you matched the banner.
WATTERS: All right, Kimberly.
GUILFOYLE: Love it when that happens.
WATTERS: Yes. We all know what you think of Dan Rather, but we've got to go to the break.
GUILFOYLE: Would you rather?
WATTERS: That's right. You'd play. ""One More Thing"" is up next.
GUTFELD: ""One More Thing,"" Kimberly.
GUILFOYLE: All right. Well, you may remember Taylor Schofield, the wonderful young man that Eric and I met during our New Year's Eve coverage in 2015. He was then suffering from kidney failure, and thanks to the Make-a-Wish Foundation, he got the opportunity of a lifetime, living his dream to be in Times Square for New Year's Eve and ringing in 2016, along with his wonderful family, on national TV.
Well, now I have an amazing update from the family: his dad, Ed, and mom, Barbara. On October 18, Taylor received his dad's kidney at UCLA, and for the first time in a year and a half he would not have to rely on a dialysis machine to keep him alive.
Both Taylor and his dad came through the kidney transplant surgery with flying colors, and Taylor is now enjoying his new freedom; and he feels incredible. What a wonderful young man he is. He's a phenomenal dancer. He and I danced the night away after, you know, midnight. It was very nice, with parental approval. And he was fantastic. He's full of life and energy, and God bless you, Taylor, and to your family, big kiss.
PERINO: Nice.
GUTFELD: Nice.
All right. Me, that's me. All right, January 28, after the inauguration, you're going to want to go to Warner Theatre in D.C., because right there-- see that? There's Dana. That's Larry Gatlin. That's myself. For a night of dancing, crying, laughing and singing. It's called ""Short Stories."" We're going to talk about politics and everything. It's January 28, Warner Theater in Washington, D.C. Go to Ticketmaster.com. Get your tickets.
Now it's time for something new.

GUTFELD: ""Greg's Honesty News.""
(END VIDEO CLIP)
GUTFELD: This is an amazing study. Do you know that two studies have found out that people who swear more are more honest, and people who swear less are dishonest. So what does that tell you?
GUILFOYLE: Oh, I love this.
GUTFELD: Swearing more is real.
GUILFOYLE: I think it's true.
GUTFELD: Because you get to your genuine self when you swear. So you're less likely to cover things up.
GUILFOYLE: More of a visceral response.
WATTERS: Dana is dishonest.
GUTFELD: Oh, she swears like a truck driver. She is something.
GUILFOYLE: Oh! Let me tell you.
PERINO: I have a very good friend who is very honest, but she would not want me to say her name, because her mom watches the show.
GUILFOYLE: Don't talk about...
PERINO: Am I next?
Nominations are now open for the 2017 Armed Forces Insurance Military Spouse of The Year. So this is a program celebrating its tenth anniversary. Open to all military spouses in each branch so they can be recognized for their commitment and sacrifice. You can make nominations, too. We're going to put it up there for you: MS -- MilitarySpouse.com (ph). Six spouses will be chosen to represent each military branch, and then they get an overall military spouse of the year. It's a really great program. We should celebrate these fabulous spouses. And then the winners will be announced on May 12 at an event at the Chamber of Commerce in D.C.
GUTFELD: Juan.
WILLIAMS: This is for my fellow aging athletes out there. Yesterday, 105- year-old Robert Marchand set a world record in Beladron (ph), just outside of Paris. He cycled into history, becoming the oldest man to bike 14.8 miles in under an hour.
What makes the story even better is that when he was a kid, they told him he'd never achieve anything in cycling. But boy, did he show them wrong.
And after the race he said he hasn't even -- you know, wasn't even tired. He could have gone faster. And in fact, he did when he was 102, but this time, he missed the notice for the last lap, and so he didn't speed up.
GUTFELD: All right. Jesse.
WATTERS: You guys all remember the clown that went after Ivanka Trump and her child on the plane. Well, I tracked this guy down. And here's a little taste.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: You harassed a woman with her baby on a flight. You proud of that?
Real class act, aren't you? Now you're afraid to show your face.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
GUILFOYLE: Wow.
WATTERS: So the full confrontation will be on my new show, ""Watters' World,"" 8 p.m. It's weekly now.
GUTFELD: Congrats!
GUILFOYLE: Congratulations.
WATTERS: Thank you guys very much. So please tune in.
GUILFOYLE: Ahem.
WATTERS: And Kimberly will be a guest. I remembered that.
GUILFOYLE: Thank you, Jesse.
GUTFELD: All right, set your DVR so you never miss an episode of ""The Five."" That does it for us. ""Special Report"" is up next."
0	25	 26 von 72	Fox News Network	January 5, 2017 Thursday	 YOUR WORLD WITH NEIL CAVUTO	 4:43 PM EST		"NEIL CAVUTO, HOST: All right, Mexicans protesting higher gas prices in that country, and likely to get still higher, but the same might apply to how they feel about Donald Trump these days, because they`re arguing right now that he is threatening Mexican jobs.
The headline in Mexican newspapers saying that Donald Trump is leaving Mexico without 3,600 jobs. And now he`s warning that he is going to do the same to Toyota, protesting the fact that Toyota wants to move a lot of those jobs south of the border in Mexico. That could be in danger. 
Let`s ask a member of Donald Trump`s economic transition team, the guy who is kind of overseeing a lot of that stuff, the former mayor of Cincinnati as well, Ken Blackwell.
Mayor, good to see you.
KENNETH BLACKWELL (R), FORMER MAYOR OF CINCINNATI, OHIO: Hey, Neil. Good to be with you, sir.
CAVUTO: Happy new year.
Not so happy, I guess, for any automaker or any U.S. manufacturer. And I would throw Toyota in that mix, since it does manufacture a lot of cars already in the United States, that dare entertains going elsewhere. What do you make of this?
(LAUGHTER)
BLACKWELL: Well, first, jawboning is an acceptable practice. And Donald Trump is really, really good at it.
The second thing is that he has the very interesting toolbox. He has carrots and he has sticks, the carrots being his promise to drive down the corporate tax rate, to deal with regulations, and to create an environment where investment in this country makes sense for auto dealers and others.
The stick is something you would hope that he would never have to act on, but the fact that he`s such a transactional person. He`s not driven by pure ideology that, you know, they -- the threat of using the stick becomes very, very real.
(CROSSTALK)
CAVUTO: But is that intimidating, too, Ken? Can it go the other way?
BLACKWELL: Well, it can go the other way, particularly if you never showed your hand in terms of using the carrots.
And I think that he`s very interested in attracting capital investment back to the country by doing those things that we know will create an environment for that investment to come off of the fence, some $2 trillion- plus, and back into this economy.
CAVUTO: Yes.
BLACKWELL: I think that he`s going to use that combination, jawboning and the threat, but more importantly he`s going to use the carrots and the incentives to get the capital flow back here, to get jobs produced here.
And I`m sure that while he would like to be liked by the Mexicans, he`s more interested in raising the incomes of working families in this country and actually raising the level -- the labor participation rate in this country.
CAVUTO: But, you know, I have heard from a lot of critics on this, Ken, on FOX Business who were telling me, boy, if he had been held to the same standards he`s forcing on U.S. manufacturers, then all those Trump shirts and ties and host of other goods that were made abroad and cheaper goods, he would be jawboning himself.
BLACKWELL: That`s the brilliance of being transactional.
I probably would be twisted in knots, because it would be a contradiction from my strong ideology in terms of free markets. But here`s a leader that basically understands what he wants to do. He wants to put Americans back to work again. He wants to attract capital.
CAVUTO: But wait a minute. You know, what they`re saying is, he`s saying, do as I say, not as I did.
BLACKWELL: Well, I know that that`s -- at the end of the day, what`s new about that in terms of politics?
CAVUTO: Yes.
BLACKWELL: I think the reality is this, that if the incentives are there, if in fact he does what he`s going to do with cutting the corporate tax rate, getting regulations under control, we then have a recipe for not ever having to pull the trigger.
But he`s just transactional enough to in fact give some real meaning to that threat. God bless him.
CAVUTO: All right, Ken Blackwell, great catching up with you. Appreciate it.
BLACKWELL: Always good to be with you, Neil. Happy new year, brother.
CAVUTO: All right. Happy new year."
0	26	 27 von 72	Fox News Network	January 5, 2017 Thursday	 YOUR WORLD WITH NEIL CAVUTO	 4:24 PM EST		"NEIL CAVUTO, HOST: You know, a lot of people got this wrong earlier today, when they heard about Rand Paul`s opposition to the Republican repeal efforts of Obamacare, or the health care law, the so-called Affordable Care Act, that he was against upending this thing.
He`s still very much against doing so. What he is opposed is the way Republicans are going about it.
Kentucky`s Republican Senator, former presidential candidate Rand Paul with us now.
Senator, good to have you. Happy new year. 
SEN. RAND PAUL (R), KENTUCKY: Thank you.
That was the fake news that says I wasn`t for repealing Obamacare. The real news is, yes, I am for repealing Obamacare, but I think we also ought to have a budget that represents conservative values and that also balances.
I`m just upset that the Republicans have pow a budget that never balances and would add $9.7 trillion to the debt over 10 years.
CAVUTO: No, it makes sense. And I understand where you`re coming from.
But the way it`s been explained to me by others, including Congressman Scalise, the House majority -- leader, is that this is a mechanism, the swiftest way to do it. I`m paraphrasing. But that is the gist of it.
PAUL: Well, sure it is.
CAVUTO: Speaker Paul Ryan saying much the same thing.
You say?
PAUL: Well, sure it is. But it doesn`t have to be a crummy mechanism. We could use a good mechanism.
I`m going to introduce an amendment, I already have, that will replace the budget, repeal Obamacare. And my budget balances in five years, because that`s what we should stand for, balancing the budget.
CAVUTO: All right.
So, as things stand right now, when you look at the numbers, Senator, there`s not a lot of wiggle room for Republicans in the Senate on this particular matter, 52 Republicans, 48 Democrats, if we just go by the traditional math. So now it`s down to 51.
A couple of Republicans could follow you and all of a sudden this doesn`t happen. They come back to you and say, Rand Paul killed our effort to kill Obamacare.
You say what?
PAUL: Well, I would say why don`t we pass a budget that balances in the foreseeable future and will kill Obamacare? They`re not mutually exclusive.
If they came to me, and they couldn`t pass it, guess what? They would have to negotiate with conservatives. And instead of the establishment always getting what they want, conservatives would have a say.
So I talked to the House Freedom Caucus today and I told them the same thing. Let`s ban together and say, enough is enough.
Here`s what gets me. When I was watching politics before I was up here, I watched Republicans double the debt under George W. Bush from $5 trillion to $10 trillion. Then I watched the Democrats double it again from $10 trillion to $20 trillion.
But now it`s the Republicans putting something that will add another $10 trillion to the deficit. It just makes my blood boil and someone has got to stand up and say enough is enough.
CAVUTO: As you know, Senators Mike Lee of Utah, Marco Rubio of Florida, Ted Cruz of Texas are all going with this, saying that our votes in favor of the Obamacare repeal resolution do not indicate in any way our support for the revenue and deficit numbers therein, nor the use of those numbers as the basis for future federal budgets.
Do you believe them?
PAUL: Well, I guess I`m a literalist. When I vote for a budget, I think that`s what I`m voting for.
And, in fact, everybody wants to say, oh, no, no, no, this is the vehicle to repeal Obamacare. But that`s not the title of the bill. I held up the bill on the Senate floor. It says the concurrent resolution for the budget of 2017.
We passed specific rules on the budget that says, through reconciliation, you can do special things, but you have to pass a budget. So this is a budget we`re passing. It has real numbers, and these numbers do have consequence.
These numbers are distributed to the committees. And these are the numbers that the committees make their decisions on how much they will spend.
I think we should be bigger than this. We should be for something. We should be conservatives. If we`re not the conservative party, who is the conservative party?
CAVUTO: Now, you also said earlier that it would be a huge mistake for Republicans if we don`t vote for replacement the same day as the repeal.
PAUL: Absolutely.
CAVUTO: But that`s a lot easier said than done. So, would you be comfortable or could you be comfortable with delaying this for conceivably quite a while if that were the case?
PAUL: I don`t think we have to delay it at all.
There`s about -- there`s at least 50 replacement bills out there. I`m going to be putting the best of the replacement bills together into one bill next week. And I will have the legislative language done by next week and I will have it prepared.
But you have to replace it on the same day, because, if not, all of the unraveling, the further unraveling of Obamacare will be placed on the repealers. And I want no part of the blame for the further unraveling of Obamacare.
It`s a terrible system. It`s causing the bankruptcy of insurers as large as -- North Carolina Blue Cross lost $400 million last year. But if you partially repeal Obamacare and leave in place some of the mandates, I think what you end with is further unraveling of the insurance industry.
And I want no part of that. I want a replacement to be out there to help people get insurance, to help them save for their insurance, and to help individuals become part of big large insurance pools, so they can have leverage, cheaper prices and less risk.
CAVUTO: Do you think it was a mistake, Senator, for Republicans to make this their kickoff issue? Should they have come up with something else?
PAUL: No, no.
No, really, I think we should have started out with a good budget, one that balances in the foreseeable future, and repeal of Obamacare and replacement. But there`s no reason -- we have been griping about Obamacare for six years. There`s no reason we shouldn`t have a replacement.
In effect, we do. There are hundreds of bills. I sat down with Congressman Tom Price today. He has got two dozen bills himself about replacement.
Let`s take some of those good ideas, put them in a bill. Many of them are already in the legislative language that are needed to become a bill.
CAVUTO: No, you raise a good point. People always assume that Republicans are good at ripping up, but they don`t have alternatives.
There are, to your point, plenty of alternatives out there.
PAUL: Dozens.
CAVUTO: But let me step back and get your take about the fallout from all of this.
Have you raised any of these objections or did you or your staff give a heads up to the president-elect that you were going to do this?
PAUL: I have been talking with the leadership of both House and Senate. I have been talking to my caucus for weeks on this, saying we should replace the same day we repeal.
(CROSSTALK)
CAVUTO: What about Donald Trump? Was it raised or did you raise it with him?
PAUL: Well, you know, I don`t talk to him on a daily basis.
But I have talked to members of the administration. They know where I stand. They know that I`m a fiscal conservative, and that to me the debt is the most important, pressing problem of our country, and that I can`t give up on believing that the debt is a problem simply to repeal Obamacare, and that if you asked me which is a bigger problem, the $20 trillion debt that we face or Obamacare, as much as I hate Obamacare, as much, as a physician, I will do anything to repeal it, I think the debt is a bigger problem.
CAVUTO: Does that extend as well, Senator, to Donald Trump`s interest in a big infrastructure package that could be upwards of a trillion dollars?
PAUL: I think there are ways to do it without adding to the debt.
I have one proposal that would take the American profit overseas, let it come home voluntarily at a low tax, but put that revenue into an infrastructure fund.
CAVUTO: Right.
PAUL: So, I think there are ways you could fund it without adding to the debt.
CAVUTO: The same with tax cuts? Would you be agreeing with your colleague in Kentucky, the majority leader, Mitch McConnell, to make sure they`re revenue-neutral?
PAUL: No, I`m for cutting taxes. I want government to be smaller. I want its revenue to be less.
But that means I want every American to have more and to take home more of their hard-earned pay. But I would shrink government. I would cut the costs, the size and scope of government, but I would also cut taxes.
And I think if you do cut taxes and shrink government, you will see growth in this country like you have never seen before.
CAVUTO: Senator Rand Paul, thank you. Very good catching up with you.
PAUL: Thanks, Neil.
CAVUTO: Senator Rand Paul.
All right. We will see how much sway that has in moving any other Republicans here. But, again, there`s not a lot of wiggle room certainly in the Senate."
0	27	 28 von 72	Fox News Network	January 5, 2017 Thursday	 YOUR WORLD WITH NEIL CAVUTO	 4:04 PM EST		"NEIL CAVUTO, HOST: As you might have just heard, of course, we had very weak retail sales, concerns over at Macy`s and Kohl`s, among others, that that could be at least telegraphing some problems in the economy down the road.
But this didn`t help matters any, because, by and large, the financial community wants to see some big wins and successes for the president-elect. This could be just a speed bump or just a pause. Whatever.
We will get the idea whether this is rift or something more substantial with the House majority whip, Steve Scalise.
Congressman, good to have you. Happy new year. 
REP. STEVE SCALISE (R-LA), HOUSE MAJORITY WHIP: Neil, good to be with you. Happy new year. Excited about this year.
CAVUTO: All right, and congratulations on your reappointment to that position.
A lot of pressure is on you and your fellow leaders and Republicans in general. Are you worried about this Rand Paul rift? And he was trying to convince some of your Freedom Caucus members, 40-strong, that maybe this isn`t a good idea. What do you think?
SCALISE: Yes, I just left the meeting with a number of Freedom Caucus members, including Mark Meadows, Raul Labrador and others.
We`re all working to make sure that our main objective is to get a bill that guts Obamacare and defunds Planned Parenthood on Donald Trump`s desk when he is president of the United States. And that`s our top priority, our first priority. There`s a lot more we`re going to do this year. But that`s the first thing up.
And we`re working to make sure that we`re all on the same page of getting this done.
CAVUTO: One of the things -- and I will it with him when we have him on -- that Senator Paul brought up. And I think it does make good sense, is there could be a lot of problems if the first effort is repealed and you don`t have something instantly there in its place, because that gap could present a lot of problems.
If for example, the mandate goes, and then you have a lot of insurance company that could go bankrupt, to say nothing of individuals who would be at a loss what to do. What do you think of that?
SCALISE: Well, first of all, let`s be clear. Millions of Americans have already lost their health care because of Obamacare.
You`re seeing insurance companies in every state leave the marketplace because of Obamacare. So, that`s not happening because of anything we do. It`s already happening because of Obamacare`s failures.
What we want to do is gut the law, get rid of the employer mandate, get rid of the individual mandate and all these other mandates that jack up the cost of health care.
In my state of Louisiana, we`re paying 25 percent more this year from last year because of the mandates of Obamacare that are unworkable. Get rid of those and go work on a marketplace. And there`s some elements of replace that we`re looking at putting into the bill that actually guts the law. You can`t do a full replace in the next few weeks.
But, as the speaker said, we are going to be moving those bills out of the House throughout this year. But there`s a lot of good things that people want to see, buying across state lines. Why can`t you buy health care across state lines, like you buy every other product? That will help lower costs.
(CROSSTALK)
CAVUTO: I guess what they`re saying, sir, is that, as important as this is to you and conservatives, Republicans in the aggregate, isn`t goosing this subpar recovery more important, like getting tax cuts going like immediately, the regulatory relief you talked about immediately?
And as important as dealing with the Affordable Care Act is and the fact that it`s not affordable, where I think even your critics would contend you`re accurate about that, that you`re putting the cart before the horse?
SCALISE: Well, actually, today, on the House floor, we`re passing a bill called REINS Act, which takes away power from unelected bureaucrats to put regulations in place like you`re referring to that are killing jobs.
We`re working on tax reform right now. Kevin Brady, chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, is already meeting with his members and with the Trump transition team to come together on a plan that actually lowers our tax rate to make us competitive again and grow the economy.
Donald Trump himself, when he`s president of the United States, he`s already said, the first day, on January 20, he`s going to take the oath, he said he wants a shorter parade so that he can actually go into the Oval Office on day one and start through executive action undoing a lot of the damaging, unconstitutional executive action from Barack Obama that is killing jobs.
So regulations are going to start going away on day one that are killing jobs in America. And we`re working with president-elect Trump, soon to be President Trump, to get that done. And that`s why I think you`re already seeing a lot of excitement in the economy.
Companies that are announcing that they`re going to move back jobs to America and canceling plans to build factories in foreign countries. That`s happening now because of what they see us doing, things that we`re going to do to get the economy moving again and to get -- to bring jobs back to America.
CAVUTO: What do you think of Donald Trump`s efforts, you mentioned this, jawboning companies to bring jobs back and keep them here?
Now his latest target has been Toyota that wanted to build a big facility in Baja, Mexico. It was the latest sign that the president-elect is going after yet another employer in this country. And Toyota is big certainly in the South with factories making lots of cars here.
Do you ever worry that that could go too far, that the intentions and jobs are good, but it could boomerang?
SCALISE: I think it`s a good thing that you have actually got a president who cares about companies creating jobs in America.
Barack Obama would, first of all, put and push regulations that would run jobs out of the country. And then as soon as the company would move those jobs out of the country, he would just go trash the company and kick them on their way out the door.
What Donald Trump is saying is, don`t leave. I want you to come here, come back to America, bring those jobs back to America. And, ultimately, it`s going to be good for your company. And so the fact that you have got a president who cares about bringing jobs back to America is one of the reasons Donald Trump got elected.
And it`s exciting to see somebody in the Oval Office getting ready to come into the Oval Office who actually cares about American jobs and rebuilding America`s economy and working with Congress to get that done.
CAVUTO: Congressman, thank you very much. Good to see you again, Steve Scalise, fine state of Louisiana, the House majority whip.
SCALISE: Great to be back with you."
0	28	 29 von 72	MSNBC	January 5, 2017 Thursday	 THE RACHEL MADDOW SHOW	 9:00 PM EST	"HIGHLIGHT: The ""National Enquirer"" tabloid turns cheerleader for Trump. Trump and Senate Republicans are trying to stifle coverage of Trump`s cabinet with a tight schedule. Andrea Mitchell, chief foreign affairs correspondent for NBC News, talked with Rachel Maddow about the testimony Senators heard today from U.S. intelligence chiefs ahead of Donald Trump`s Friday briefing on Russian interference in the U.S. election. Rachel Maddow welcomed Greta Van Susteren to MSNBC and congratulated her on the launch of her new show, ""For the Record with Greta,"" which will air weeknights at 6pm ET from Washington, D.C.

"	"JOY REID, MSNBC GUEST HOST: THE RACHEL MADDOW SHOW starts right now.
Rachel, that was a little bit of tongue twister at the end. Katherine Clark was great.
RACHEL MADDOW, MSNBC ANCHOR: She was great and you know what? THE RACHEL MADDOW SHOW does start right now, too. So, you didn`t tongue twist that at all. Here we go. Thank you.
And thanks to you at home for starting up and staying with us for the next hour. There`s a lot going on tonight.
We`ve got two excellent experienced life-long journalists here tonight as our guests which is really good because this is a night when there seems to be a lot of news breaking into the evening hours. 
At just about 7:00 Eastern Time tonight, we got a surprise out-of-the-blue announcement that former CIA Director James Woolsey has abruptly quit the Donald Trump transition team.
Mr. Woolsey had been on the Trump transition, we had no advanced word that there was anything wrong in that relationship or he might be on his way out. He was on TV as recently as yesterday speaking for the incoming administration, defending them on various matters related to his area of expertise. But for whatever reason abruptly and with no notice tonight, James Woolsey has quit the Trump transition, saying it`s effective immediately.
Now, they`re not saying what it`s about, but that, of course, has led to lots of speculation. Again, he`s a former CIA director and today was a high-profile day for the nation`s spies. Heads of the nation`s intelligence agencies testified today about Russia`s cyber attacks on the American presidential election. ""NBC Nightly News"" reported tonight that the Russia attack also apparently targeted the White House and the Joint Chiefs of Staff in addition to the offices of the Democratic Party.
""The Washington Post"" is reporting late tonight that the intelligence community has direct intercepted evidence of Russian officials celebrating our election results, celebrating Donald Trump`s win over Hillary Clinton as a victory for Russia.
So, that`s breaking and developing news tonight on that subject. There`s some additional threads of that story that are continuing to break into this evening. We`re going to have Andrea Mitchell here shortly with the latest on that.
But, you know, it`s not always mainstream media and nationally known hard- working journalists with a lifetime of pushy experience under their belt who end up bringing you the most important news in a particular news cycle. Sometimes even the biggest political scoops related to a presidential election can come from not where you`d expect but actually some pretty low- brow sources.
Por ejemplo, it was the supermarket tabloid the ""National Enquirer"" that broke the news a couple months ago that Hillary Clinton had been caught on camera having a seedy romp at this motel. ""The National Enquirer"" broke that news the week of the election.
Actually, to give them their credit, they had quite a bit. They had quite a bit of new stuff. They had a whole bunch of scoops just on that one cover that one week. All on that same cover, there`s the seedy romp caught on camera at this motel, roughly identified in the picture by the sign that says ""motel.""
They also broke news on the same cover that Hillary Clinton was not just having a seedy on-camera romp at this motel. It was a gay seedy romp at this motel, because apparently Hillary Clinton is gay. At least she`s gay when she`s at that motel.
Also same cover, yet another scoop, Hillary Clinton is hooked on drugs. Hillary Clinton is hooked on narcotics. Also same cover, yet another scoop, Hillary Clinton blackmailed the FBI, in a back room deal to avoid prosecution. That`s a lot of news to break on one $1.95 cover.
If you notice, though, the red banner at the top, this scoop-filled cover, that issue of the ""National Enquirer,"" wait, there`s more. That was only one part of a two-part ""National Enquirer"" exclusive scoop about Hillary Clinton having a secret hit man. See? Part two of Clinton hitman`s explosive tell-all.
Part one of Hillary hitman tells all was the previous week. That was the explosive story that will change the election. That was about her top- secret file of 24 years worth of cover-ups and crimes.
""The Enquirer"" got their hands on that file. They got the hitman to reveal the smoking gun proof that Hillary Clinton bribes reporters, that Hillary Clinton had her hitman pay hush money to hookers. Hoo boy.
I mean, leading up to the election, it was really something else. I mean, we`re used to ""The National Enquirer"" of being like, you know, celebrity divorces and who`s too fat and who`s too skinny and everybody`s always on the brink of dying.
But starting this past summer, starting in the heat of the general election, this nationally distributed low-brow high-profile supermarket tabloid, they really stopped doing most of the other stuff that they do and they became full-time full-bore this.
Corrupt! Breaking news, new FBI indictment. Really? A new one? What was the first one?
Also, Hillary failed secret FBI lie detector, the shocking bribe.
Donald Trump`s revenge on Hillary and her puppets. You see the little inset there? That`s Muslim Obama, little Bloomberg, weird Tim Kaine.
In case you don`t want to bother reading this particular expose, they pretty much nut it up on the cover there in the red dots, mob connections, shady billion dollar deals, gay double life. There`s the gay thing again.
But you know what? Gay was the least of her problems because by the end of next week, look, Hillary Clinton gained 103 pounds. She`s eating herself to death. Poor Bill, Bill will be dead by Election Day.
Actually, no, wait, just a couple weeks later she`s the one who will be dead by Election Day and the reason they know this is, one, obviously, look at her but they at the ""National Enquirer,"" they say they obtained exclusively revealed at last her full medical file. Revealed at last. Hillary Clinton who you can see from this obviously un-retouched photo she`s already dead, maybe. They had to dig her up to take that picture. I mean, she`s definitely suffering from Alzheimer`s disease.
Even still, though, even though she`s probably already dead and she has Alzheimer`s, she`s probably still a threat with her violent rages and all and she has 10 deadly secrets every American must know. So this dead lady is a threat.
Not to put to fine a point on it, the ""National Enquirer"" finishes that off with ""Jail Clinton now.""
Just a fire hose of this stuff heading into the election and mostly, it`s this kind of unbelievable hit stuff on Hillary Clinton. Look -- corrupt! Racist! Criminal! That was the ""National Enquirer`s"" election eve special. That`s what they put in supermarkets across the country as people are going to vote.
You get a sense of how they treated Clinton. But it was also at the same time this. Did you know Donald Trump did release his tax returns? He did because the ""National Enquirer"" has them. The documents America has been waiting to see.
You might have heard that Donald Trump didn`t release his tax returns but that`s just a Hillary ugly smear campaign that has now fallen apart because the ""National Enquirer"" is publishing his tax returns. And incidentally, he really is worth $10 billion. Donald Trump tax returns, the ""National Enquirer`s"" world exclusives.
Supermarket tabloids being weird or outrageous or fantastically false is, you know, it`s like reporting the sun rises in the east. I know.
But with the ""National Enquirer"" specifically, there`s something going on here, right? I mean, all that stuff that I just showed you was leading up to the election. Right up through election eve.
Since the election, it`s been this. ""Trump takes charge."" ""Success in just 36 days."" ""He smacked down arrogant China, he saved jobs."" Then it says ""What`s next? Peace between Israel and its enemies."" Obviously.
Meanwhile, up in the left-hand corner there, poor 117 pound Bill Clinton he may have beaten Alzheimer`s and Parkinson`s which they said was killing him a few weeks ago but he`s dead again, this time he`s caught the cancer.
Look at the kind -- these are the kinds of pictures they run of bill and Hillary Clinton and look at the pictures they run of Donald Trump. That`s November 28th, December 5th, December 12th.
And actually this is what`s on newsstands now. Look at that.
If it`s starting to seem like this is not just a bizarre turn for this supermarket tabloid that was going to last the duration of the election, it seems like this is a new Trump news out let indefinitely now. Look at this which they published since the election. ""Muslim spies in Obama`s CIA."" ""Infested"", that`s a nice term. ""Infested. 55 double agents exposed.""
Right under that it says, ""Why we must not stop water boarding or close Guantanamo."" and in the lower right-hand corner there, ""Secret list of traitors inside."" The Muslim spies in Obama`s CIA.
It`s not just for the election. It`s apparently for governing, too. Trump media strategy is basically to avail itself of what is an alternate parallel universe to traditional journalism, right? And we have talked about this over the course of the campaign in terms of, like, fake stories and social media stuff and, you know, using social media and stuff.
But a lot of the beltway discussion even now continues to be just about how mystifying we all apparently find it that he will continue to tweet in his unpredictable misspelled helter-skelter way after he`s sworn in. Yeah, he`s going to keep tweeting. But the tweeting isn`t all of it. His communication strategy, his media strategy really is also this stuff.
I mean, the ""National Enquirer"" is ridiculous. It is exactly what you think it is. Donald Trump did not release his tax returns to the ""National Enquirer"" or anyone. The ""National Enquirer"" did not obtain Hillary Clinton`s full medical file which shows that she has Alzheimer`s and violent rages, nor is Cher dying, broke, or alone, nor was Ted Cruz`s dad linked in the JFK assassination.
I mean, in this universe, the ""National Enquirer"" is ridiculous. It`s a laugh out loud diversion, but not to our new president.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENT-ELECT: There was a picture on the front page of the ""national enquirer"" which does have credibility and they`re not going to do pictures like that because they get sued for a lot of money if things are wrong, OK? A lot of money, and there was a picture.
All I did is point out the fact that on the cover of the ""National Enquirer"" there was a picture of him and crazy Lee Harvey Oswald having breakfast. This was a magazine that, frankly, in many respects, should be very respected. I mean, if that was the ""New York Times,"" they would have gotten Pulitzer Prizes for their reporting. I`ve always said why didn`t the ""National Enquirer"" get the Pulitzer Prize.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
MADDOW: One of the new depths of field on which we need to train our focus for this new era that we`re in now is their strategy, the new administration`s strategy around media management. It`s different. It`s really different.
I mean, other presidents have tried to change the traditional politician relationship with the media. President Obama talked to comedians, right, and talked to YouTube stars. President George W. Bush and his dad both did lots and lots of really right-wing talk radio. Go back to the fireside chats of FDR, you will find presidents either trying to reach people through non-traditional elements of the media or try to find ways around the media in a way that best suits their purposes as president.
But there is going to be something different and it`s not just the tweeting. There`s old school elements to the very different media approach the Trump administration is taking and it`s important in terms of thinking about how they`re going to wield power and how they`re going to try to get their way.
I mean, he did put a guy most recently in charge of a fringe right wing web site not just in charge of his campaign but now in the Oval Office at his chief strategist. That continues to matter in terms of how they operate. They really are using supermarket tabloids that have huge distribution. And their covers are in every grocery store in America whether or not you buy them. They are using this thing against their political enemies and to promote their political selves.
And tonight, as we get ready to talk to a couple of great journalists here on this show, people who have meant a lot to me in my own career, people who outlasted all sorts of ups and downs in this business that we`re in, I just -- I just want to stick a pin in this particular dynamic with this new administration because I think it`s worth keeping in mind as a lens, as a way of focusing on what`s about to happen, because next week, we are about to get a real charge in terms of the aggressive and sometimes weird ways this new administration manages media.
On Tuesday night next week, you`ve heard President Obama is going to be giving his farewell address, his prime time farewell address in Chicago. That Tuesday, as far as we know, that will also be the first day of the Jeff Sessions confirmation hearings, this incredible controversial confirmation hearings for him as attorney general.
The following day, Wednesday of next week, January 11th, that will be the second day of the Jeff Sessions confirmation hearing. That same day will also be the confirmation hearing for the man they nominated to run the CIA. It will also be the confirmation hearing for Betsy DeVos, a very controversial nominee to run the Department of Education. It will also the hearing for John Kelly, the homeland security nominee, his hearing is supposed to be the place we debate building the wall and other immigration proposals of this administration.
On the same day, that`s the day Mitch McConnell`s wife Elaine Chao will have her hearing. It`s also the day that the Exxon CEO, Rex Tillerson will have his confirmation hearing. There are six mega confirmation hearings called for the same day, all called for Wednesday.
And on that same day, the Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has scheduled what they call a vote-a-rama which means a million different votes on a million different amendments on their proposed budget legislation. That will include the first votes on repealing Obamacare. That will happen in the Senate on the same day.
And on that same day, we now know we are going to have the first press conference from the president-elect since July, since he invited the Russians to hack Hillary Clinton`s e-mails back in July. He hasn`t done a press conference since then but he`s going to do it now. That day.
You see what they`re doing here?
And the Democrats are going to try to slow these things down, presumably they will appeal to spread these things out so they don`t all happen on one day, but what this is is an aggressive media strategy. It`s an aggressive political strategy to schedule almost all of the most controversial things that will happen in the confirmation process to all happen simultaneously. While we are basically guaranteed that probably none of them will get any media coverage whatsoever because all of those hearings, as controversial as they may be, all of them will simultaneously happen and they will all simultaneously be blotted out in the media by the fact that Donald Trump will be doing his first live press conference in seven months.
And you may think it`s weird for me to describe that as a media strategy, right, the way they have stacked those individual things on top of each other, all for the same day. You may think it`s weird for me to call that a media strategy. But really, is that less weird than this?
This is part of what they`re doing. Expect anything.
We`ll be right back.
MADDOW: So, I mentioned at the top of the show that NBC News broke the store they the intelligence review of the Russian cyber attack on the United States includes evidence that the Russians didn`t just target the Democratic Party, they also targeted the White House and the joint chiefs. ""The Washington Post"" further reports tonight that the review includes evidence of Russian officials celebrating Donald Trump`s election victory as a win for Russia.
Well, now, we are also getting reporting that the intelligence review has found the link, the link between the Russian government hacking those documents, hacking those servers, hacking those sources of information in the United States, they found the link between the Russian government and those documents getting to WikiLeaks, which is how they got released into the U.S. bloodstream.
There`s a lot of developing stories in this particular topic tonight as that intelligence review is briefed to the White House, is going to be briefed to the president-elect and then is going to be briefed to the rest of the country next week. We`ve got the latest on that with Andrea Mitchell, next.
MADDOW: As I mentioned, we`re having some developing stories that continue to break new details throughout the evening tonight, a lot of them related to the intelligence review of the Russian hacking to the American election.
Just as we were coming on the air, we got news former CIA Director James Woolsey tonight has abruptly quit the Trump transition team with no explanation. He was on TV as recently as yesterday speaking in his capacity as part of the transition and giving the Trump transition credibility in terms of having a former CIA director on their side. But apparently, that`s done and he`s not explaining why.
Also tonight, we`re getting our first bit of reporting into the intelligence community`s investigation into the Russian hacking which was requested by President Obama after the election. That report was presented to President Obama today. While Director of National Intelligence James Clapper testified to Congress about what the Russians did. Director Clapper will personally brief the president-elect, Mr. Trump, on this new report tomorrow.
""NBC Nightly News"" reports that this report contains evidence that the Russia attack didn`t just target the Democratic Party. It also targeted institutions including the White House as well as the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
""The Washington Post"" reporting that intelligence agencies intercepted communications after the election in which senior Russian government officials were heard celebrating and congratulating themselves on the outcome of the American presidential election, celebrating Donald Trump`s win as a victory for Russia and congratulating each other as Russian officials for their role in it.
Now in addition to that, ""The Washington Post"" and NBC News say the report includes evidence that the actors have been identified who delivered the stolen Democratic e-mails, stolen by the Russian government, they think they`ve identified basically the couriers, the way those pieces of information were delivered from the Russian government to WikiLeaks.
President-elect`s going to get this full over 50-page-long classified report delivers to him tomorrow. We`ll get an unclassified version of it next week, but we`re getting a bunch of details tonight.
Joining us to make sense of this is Andrea Mitchell, NBC News chief foreign affairs correspondent, host of ""ANDREA MITCHELL REPORTS.""
Andrea, I know you were at the Senate hearing today. Thanks for staying up late to be with us tonight. I appreciate it.
In terms of --
ANDREA MITCHELL, NBC NEWS CHIEF FOREIGN AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT: Sure thing, what a day.
MADDOW: It`s been -- it`s been nuts. And the stories continue to develop through the evening.
Can -- what do you think is most important in terms of what we`ve had basically leaked, what we`ve learned what`s in the intelligence report?
MITCHELL: Well, first of all, from the hearing itself to get back to basics. James Clapper, who is celebrating 53 years as a spy and has 15 days to go and is counting the days until he`s out, he is going to be leading the brief of Donald Trump tomorrow and he said what he has learned since October 7th when he and Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson jointly declared the -- their conclusion that this was done by Russia and done at the highest level, which is only means one person, Vladimir Putin, that back on October 7th, that he is now more certain that they have collected more information or done more analysis since then, and that they are -- that it is more authoritative, more conclusive than before.
Lindsey Graham said to me today, he`s a thousand percent sure that no one who has been briefed on this disagreed with the conclusion and it was rare unanimity in that hearing today. Very little dissent that it was Russia.
Varying degrees and some dissent as to how much Donald Trump`s criticism of the intelligence agencies should be faulted. Clearly, there was a partisan divide on that to a certain extent, although Republicans are very uncomfortable about it, many of them, but don`t want to be overtly criticizing the president-elect. So, they would more focus on Russia which is a sort of unifying factor here.
So, for Donald Trump to disagree with the conclusions tomorrow would be startling but that`s what they`re bracing themselves for.
Now, a little bit of context for this -- for what`s been reported out of what this report will be. The report goes all the way back to 2008, 2012. It goes back to a lot of things we have reported and knew previously about Russia`s hacking. We knew that the State Department computers were shut down in June of 2015 because of Russian hacking. We`ve known a lot about this before.
And what John McCain said in the opening statement is we know the joint chiefs and the White House and State Department have been hacked in the past by Russia. What hadn`t been reported before is that this is going to be combined in the report and what is new in the reporting on ""NBC Nightly News"" by Hallie Jackson tonight was the motives involved as well. That Putin had a grievance against this administration going all the way back, feeling he was being delegitimized by Barack Obama. Ironies abound.
MADDOW: Andrea, we`ve seen evolving explanations from the president-elect and his team in terms of why they don`t buy it. It was initially they said that the intelligence agencies weren`t all on the same page. It`s clear they are now on the same page. Then they said they`d release -- they had released no evidence to prove their case, they have obviously over the holidays and now, with this new report are releasing tons of evidence to prove their case.
We got word from the president-elect, sort of strangely, over the weekend, that he had secret information that nobody else had that would be revealed on Tuesday or Wednesday, and that that was why he didn`t believe that Russia was behind the hacking. Since then we`ve had him take shots at the intelligence community, going so far as to put the word ""intelligence"" in scare quotes as if it`s not real intelligence and in the ""Wall Street Journal"" we`ve had a report they`re planning on not just continuing to disparage the intelligence community but take it apart. Maybe get rid of the director of national intelligence and to slim down the other agencies, all basically saying the agencies can`t produce anything useful because they`re corrupt or politicized.
This evolving -- these evolving explanations and excuses, do they run out eventually? Or at this point, we see it as an infinite process and they`re never going to accept its conclusion?
MITCHELL: I think we should bring our viewers into the circle of how difficult it is and will be to cover this administration so far at least, because -- for one thing, Donald Trump tweeted a tweet yesterday that was almost universally interpreted to mean he was siding with Julian Assange, the fugitive founder of WikiLeaks and public enemy number one considered by the intelligence agencies for that huge dump starting with Chelsea Manning, and then today said that that was a media lie, that he was not siding with Assange at all and that he`s a fan of the intelligence agencies.
So, was he dialing that in anticipation of tomorrow`s report or is he going to load it up tomorrow?
Sean Spicer said the ""Wall Street Journal"" report is 100 percent incorrect.
And there are a lot of people within the intelligence community who would like to see some reordering of the post-9/11 reforms, quote/unquote, ""reforms"", and that perhaps DNI is too bureaucratic.
So, there should be an assessment, a lot of people say, after they are in office and can take a close look but not before and not when it seems to be sort of a brushback pitch against the intelligence briefers who are going to be visiting with him tomorrow.
By the way, I have learned they are going to be briefing the ""Gang of Eight"", which is not as sinister as it sounds. It`s the bicameral bipartisan intelligence leaders, both houses, Democrats and Republicans, they`re going to be meeting secretly with Clapper and Comey and the others tomorrow morning before they fly to New York for this briefing which, again, I have been told was scheduled for at least a week to be tomorrow, not as Donald Trump had tweeted and suggested was being delayed so they could firm up their evidence.
This is messy stuff and do you believe the ""Wall Street Journal"" reporting, some of which we heard independently or do you believe Sean Spicer`s strong denial and what`s going to come next? It`s a very confusing bit but we hope the declassified version will at least give us more clarity.
MADDOW: That`s right. And it`s one thing to parse different people who are supposedly on the same team saying different things. It`s another thing when the principal, when the president-elect says things that contradict his own self.
Andrea Mitchell, NBC News chief foreign affairs correspondent, host of ""ANDREA MITCHELL REPORTS"" -- it`s always great to have you here, Andrea. Thank you.
MITCHELL: Thank you. Thank you.
MADDOW: So, it`s been one of those days where the news doesn`t stop to collect itself before it jumps on the next news story. We`ve got another excellent journalist here tonight who I`m very excited to introduce you to.
Stay with us.
MADDOW: Secretary of State John Kerry today held what is probably his last news conference. Reporter asked him about the incoming administration and Secretary Kerry offered a question of his own.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
JOHN KERRY, SECRETARY OF STATE: Nobody can predict what choice this is administration is going to make. I don`t know. I don`t think you know. A question a lot of people ask is, do they know?
(END VIDEO CLIP)
MADDOW: That was the question back from the secretary of state. But if that one felt like a twinge, the outgoing vice president today got asked about the president-elect tweeting insults at congressional Democrats. He didn`t wait for the question to end before he started to answer himself.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
JOSEPH BIDEN, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Grow up, Donald. Grow up. Time to be an adult, you`re president.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
MADDOW: Much more ahead tonight. Stay with us.
MADDOW: Almost everybody who watches TV watches it on TV, or at least on some sort of screen, right? On your phone or something?
At some point, though, you may find yourself with the opportunity to watch TV in person where the TV show is filmed. And if you ever do get to attend the taping of a TV show, the first thing you will find that the studio looks really different in person than it does on TV.
Por ejemplo, behold! Look how much space there is around me! You could fit, like, many elephants in here. Smallish? Smallish, friendly elephants, but still, it doesn`t seem like that, right?
TV studios are tricky. TV studios are expensive and right now this company is building a brand new studio in Washington, D.C. for a new show that starts on Monday. Monday, it starts Monday, today is Thursday.
Look, this is the progress of the new studio as of today. Ahh! Hurry up you, guys.
But also, hold that thought.
MADDOW: In telling the stories of the day, covering the day`s news, on this show, we tend to show a lot of archive footage. I don`t know if you saw when we ran our year end credits this year, there are like five zillion archivists in our credits.
We love our archivists, we love our archives, we love showing news footage and historical footage from all the way back to the dawn of news.
We play a lot less contemporary news coverage on this show. I know a lot of other shows do it, but I just don`t end up showing a lot of, you know, ""here`s a thing somebody said on TV last night."" It just doesn`t come up that often on this show.
One thing I have noticed, though, over the eight years or so that we`ve been doing this show is that when I do use contemporary footage, when there`s no other way to tell the story without showing you what just happened on somebody else`s TV show, that footage disproportionately and by a mile tends to come from one place -- it has come from one show, hosted by one particular person who we`ve used footage from over and over and over again.

MADDOW: Mr. Gingrich appeared on Greta Van Susteren`s program at FOX News.
GRETA VAN SUSTEREN, TV HOST: What would you do about Libya?
NEWT GINGRICH (R), FORMER HOUSE SPEAKER: Exercise a no-fly zone this evening.
MADDOW: Foreign policy pronouncements like this one that he made this week with my friend Greta Van Susteren on FOX News.
DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENT-ELECT: Bring ISIS to the table or beyond that, defeat ISIS very quickly and I`m not going to tell you what it is tonight. You know, one of the problems that we have --
VAN SUSTEREN: Why won`t you tell us? Hey, Donald, Donald --
(CROSSTALK)
TRUMP: I`ll tell you why, because I don`t want to, Greta.
VAN SUSTEREN: Donald, why don`t you tell?
MADDOW: That baffled even the usually unflappable Greta Van Susteren at FOX News.
RICK SANTORUM (R), FORMER U.S. SENATOR: So, that combination is causing a problem at Social Security. I simply made that point. My --
VAN SUSTEREN: You don`t think that`s weird?
MADDOW: Greta in the background saying ""that`s a little weird.""
Donald Trump speaking tonight with my friend Greta Van Susteren on the FOX News Channel.
VAN SUSTEREN: Donald, you issued a statement there should be a complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States. Is that your view?
TRUMP: Absolutely.
MADDOW: This was one of my all-time favorite Greta moments from when she was on FOX.
REP. DUNCAN HUNTER (R), CALIFORNIA: I know that at least 10 ISIS fighters have been caught coming across the Mexican border in Texas. There`s nobody talking about.
VAN SUSTEREN: How do you know that?
HUNTER: There`s -- because I`ve asked -- because I`ve asked the border patrol, Greta.
VAN SUSTEREN: And the border patrol just let ISIS members come across the border?
(END VIDEO CLIPS)
MADDOW: If you want to count on your fingers how many times we on this show have played clips of Greta Van Susteren over the years, you could not do it. You need like four extra hands.
And I know everybody thinks that various news outlets and news networks are at each other`s throats, particularly between FOX and MSNBC, we must hate each other`s guts, but you know what? Greta Van Susteren is great. She is.
And she has an uncanny ability to make newsworthy things happen when the red light is on the camera and she is on TV talking about the news. She can get anybody to talk to her. She has reported from all over the world. She had a decade at CNN. She had 14 years at FOX.
She`s also outside this building one of the single-most decent and genuine and honorable people I have ever come across in this business. And this that I just showed you a minute ago, this is her new studio to be, because she starts here at MSNBC 6:00 Eastern on Monday night. And I could not be happier about it.
And joining us now from right next to her brand new studio in D.C. is Greta Van Susteren host of ""FOR THE RECORD"", which launches here on MSNBC, 6:00 Monday night.
My friend, congratulations.
VAN SUSTEREN: You know, and, Rachel, thank you, that`s so kind of you and I couldn`t be happier.
I mean, just think about it. I mean, I`m the luckiest person alive. I mean, look, I have many good friends over at CNN and over at FOX News Channel who have been colleagues to, but just think about this -- I know Chris Matthews, known him for years, Andrea Mitchell, travelled the world with her following secretaries of state, even trying to keep up with Andrea because she outraces all of us.
You and I have been friends for a long time. You and -- and to be honest you and my husband and I have tipped a few glasses of wine together -- or more. So, I mean, like -- so, I mean, how could I not be luckier? It`s like this is just so exciting. This is fun for me. I`m thrilled to be here.
MADDOW: You are one of the few people who has now had careers at all three of the major competing cable news outlets and you and I know that people are -- you know, individuals exist within different universes and people get, you know, varying degrees of autonomy within their networks.
But I`ve got to ask you, if your FOX fans are mad at you for coming to MSNBC, do they feel like you`re crossing enemy lines?
VAN SUSTEREN: Oh, listen, I`m getting hit from the right and left. But that happens. I mean, you know it, too, being in the business. People get mad at you every single night.
And, look, I just want -- I just want them to give me a chance. If they don`t like me, fine, but at least give me a chance. I think that the MSNBC audience is going to like me. I hope the FOX audience comes over here. I`m interested in the facts and wherever the facts lead me.
And, look, I like a robust debate. People don`t always agree with each other. My own husband doesn`t always agree with me. My own family doesn`t agree with me.
So, you know, look, I -- I want to have a good time over here. I want to do a good job for MSNBC. I want to do a really good job so you`re proud of me, my colleagues are proud of me and most of all, I want to do a good job for the viewers and the voters at home because these are very, very serious times, and people have really big problems, and they`re really worried about the future. And I`m hoping to put a spotlight on the problems, try to chase down some facts and maybe get some good things going on.
MADDOW: You know, one of the things I have that always been envious of you for is your ability to get anybody to talk to you. Like, your history, your interview history is like reading an encyclopedia. But in the last year or two, you`ve been particularly good at getting Donald Trump to talk to you about getting all the Republicans to talk to you.
Let me ask you, honestly, do you feel like some of that was specific to the fact that you were at FOX, or do you think that those Republican connections that you made, the Republican guests you`ve been able to book up to and including the president-elect, do you think they will still want to talk to you over here? I certainly hope so.
VAN SUSTEREN: I think so. I mean, look, I`m curious and I think they`re going to come over here. I`m going to give them a fair shake. I`m going to give Republicans a fair shake. I`m going to give Democrats a fair shake.
You know, here`s sort of the odd thing. As certain as I am of anything at all, Rachel, I`m not 100 percent certain. So, I actually want to know what people have to say because maybe they`ll change my mind. Maybe I`m wrong about something.
So, you know, I think I`m a very -- I think I`m a curious person and I`m not out to gun anybody down. I`m out to get some information and, frankly, I want to hear what they have to say.
MADDOW: Greta Van Susteren, host of the soon to be hit show ""FOR THE RECORD"" here on MSNBC starting Monday at 6:00 -- Greta, I can`t speak for everybody in the building, but let me speak for everybody in the building. We`re super psyched that you`re coming here and I can`t wait for you to get to work here. It`s really going to be great to be a colleague.
VAN SUSTEREN: And you know what, Rachel? I am so glad to be here. It`s fun for me.
Look, you`re my friend. I mean, this is exciting. I`ve wanted to work with you. So, this is great.
So, thank you very much. It`s been fun. And I look forward to a lot of exciting times ahead.
MADDOW: Good times. Thanks, Greta. Good luck.
All right. Let me just say I know what you`re thinking. Nobody asked to do that. It`s true. Nobody asked me to do that.
I do not have that kind of relationship with anybody who works as an executive in this building. I did that of my own accord because I really am psyched about Greta being here. I do think she`s great.
And I know you`re thinking ex-FOX News, really, Maddow?
Really. She`s her own person. Nobody tells Greta what to do. Nobody ever has.
She`s incredibly heterogeneous in terms of her ideological interests, in terms of her convincibility. She`s been all over the world. She really does have an incredible curiosity and enthusiasm for this job and I think you`re going to like her and I think you should give her a chance.
So there. OK, go away.
MADDOW: Tomorrow in our nation`s capital, we will witness something unique, real history in the making stuff. It`s not getting a lot of attention yet, but it should. It involves two large, pretty mahogany boxes. It also involves Vice President Joe Biden.
But it`s going to happen tomorrow, midway. We`re going to witness something that has not happened since the 1870s. Vice President Biden, pretty mahogany boxes, also the dawn of a new era in U.S. history.
I don`t know why the story is not getting attention, but it is next. And that story is next.
MADDOW: 1776, we declared our independence. Hurray!
Five years later, 1781 we got the Articles of Confederation, which spelled out how we were governed as a country, at least for a hot minute. But the Articles of Confederation did not include us having a president.
There wasn`t an executive branch at all. It wasn`t until seven years later when we ratified the Constitution in 1788, that`s how we got a president. And so, after 1788, with te Constitution, we needed to hold an election to pick a president for the first time.
So, ratified 1788. 1789 was the first presidential election in the United States. It wasn`t a particularly eventful one. There was only one guy running.
George Washington stood for president in that first presidential election in 1789. Nobody ran against him. He got all the electoral votes, 1789.
Then in 1792, it was time for our second presidential election. Again, nobody ran against George Washington. Would you?
There were 132 electoral votes cast in that second election and again, they all went to George Washington.
Then, of course, at the end of that second term, four years later, he bowed out. He gave his famous farewell address. He started making plans to go home to Mt. Vernon to start making booze.
George Washington left office after two elections in which he had run unopposed. And that meant that in 1796, 20 years after we first declared independence as a country, it was finally time to have our first real presidential election, you know, with competing candidates and everything.
In those first two elections we`d had as a country, Washington got every single electoral vote. But in the first election after that, the first real contested election -- look at this -- freaking 13 different people got electoral votes.
John Adams got the most. So, he got to be president. Jefferson came in second. He got to be vice president. But, look, 11 other guys got electoral votes.
And that election in 1796, kind of the first real presidential election we had as a country, that is the last time so many people got so many electoral votes in a presidential election. Nothing like that has ever happened again in our country. Until this year.
I`m not sure why this isn`t getting more attention today given the craziness of this presidential election year. But tomorrow is the day that the Electoral College results from this year`s presidential election are going to get certified by Congress. And the Electoral College results from this year`s presidential election are nuts.
I mean, yes, Donald Trump won the presidency by winning a majority of the Electoral College votes. But there are two historically bizarre things that that have happened in the Electoral College this year. Well, three, if you count the fact that nobody`s ever won the Electoral College and won the presidency while also losing the popular vote by almost 3 million votes.
But even if you put that aside -- when the Electoral College voted on December 19th, the electors cast their votes for seven different people. Donald Trump got the most, Hillary Clinton got the second most. But electors also cast votes for Bernie Sanders and John Kasich and Rand Paul and Faith Spotted Eagle. And three different electors cast their votes for Colin Powell.
We haven`t seen that many different people get votes in the Electoral College literally since 1796, while we were still figuring out what a presidential election was.
And that`s not all. In addition to the sheer number of people who got Electoral College votes, we also set a record this year for the number of electors who were bound to support a particular candidate, but they bailed on that obligation and instead decided to vote for somebody else.
When seven electors broke ranks this year and cast their ballots for people other than the candidate they were bound to support, that was the largest number of electors to defect on a presidential ballot since 1872.
In 1872, they had great reason to defect and switch their vote to somebody else, instead of the presidential candidate they were bound to support, because in 1872, there was this guy whose 66 electors who are obligated to support because their state had voted for him. His name was Horace Greeley. And he up and died between the election and when the Electoral College cast their votes. It was terrible.
Five days before the election, Horace Greeley`s wife died. Five days after that he lost the presidential election. Then right after he lost the presidential election he lost his business, he lost his newspaper. Then after that, dude just up and died before the Electoral College even got a chance to meet and cast their ballots to formalize the result of that election.
Of the 66 electors who were bound to vote for old dead Horace Greeley, 63 of the 66 bolted and voted for somebody else, which you can kind of understand, right? He was dead. I mean, hats off to the three who still voted for the dead guy, right? That`s a friend indeed.
But that`s the last time. I mean, that also bizarre election in 1872, punctuated by the death of the runner candidate, that`s the last time this many electors bolted, flipped the bird to the Electoral College, said no. When it comes to the presidential election, I`m just going to vote my own way.
But seven electors did that this year in the Electoral College in seven different sort of random people received votes in the Electoral College this year. And that is historically bizarre on both counts. That is also going to be formally certified tomorrow at roughly 12:50 p.m. Eastern Time. Two big pretty mahogany boxes containing the certified vote from the states, those boxes will be carried from the Senate into the House chamber. And then, Vice President Biden will oversee a formal count and a certification.
And then, tomorrow, sometime in the 1:00 hour, Vice President Biden will formally announce the certification of the Electoral College vote and the election of the president and the election of the new vice president, and it will be done. And with those results being certified it will also start a new era in American history, when really for the first time in our country, for the first time in our history as a country, we won`t really know what`s going to happen the next time the Electoral College gets together to cast its votes, because it went a little hinky this year.
I mean, we broke rules this year that hadn`t been broken since the 1790s and the 1870s, and that is neat from a historical perspective. But it may also put a little shiver up your spine, right? I mean, when we decided to get rid of the century`s old structures that make up our country, there`s an argument to be made that we ought to actually make an overt, considered decision to do that, because whether you like the old structures of our democracy or not, they are the only ones we`ve got unless and until we build new ones.
And I`m not sure anybody`s much going to notice, but one part of the long epic sweep of American history is going to take a jolt tomorrow when those mahogany boxes get carried into the House. It will start just before 1:00 p.m. tomorrow.
That does it for us tonight. We will see you again tomorrow.
Now, it`s time for ""THE LAST WORD"" where Ari Melber is sitting in for Lawrence tonight, who I can recognize clearly because I know what he looks like.
Good evening, Ari.

(END VIDEOTAPE)
REID: Good evening from New York, I`m Joy Reid in for Chris Hayes. In 15 days, Donald Trump will become the President of the United States, and tomorrow, he`ll come face to face with a group he seems to choose -- he seems oppose more than anyone since Hillary Clinton, America`s Intelligence Community. A senior U.S. intelligence official tells NBC news that the director of national intelligence and the heads of the NSA, the CIA and the FBI are all scheduled to be at Trump Tower tomorrow to brief the President- elect on their finding that Russia was behind the election hacking of democratic e-mails. President Obama received the same briefing this morning, but it`s a conclusion that Trump still refuses to accept. Appearing to favor the denials by WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, delivered most recently in an interview with a very solicitous Sean Hannity on Fox News over the evidence presented by American intelligence professionals.
And it`s leaving Trump increasingly isolated. Today, he turned to his favorite medium, Twitter, to defend himself, tweeting, ""The dishonest media like saying that I am in agreement with Julian Assange. Wrong. I simply state what he states. It is for the people to make up their own minds as to the truth. The media likes to make it look like I`m against ""Intelligence"" when in fact I`m a big fan!"" Now, it`s tough to square that claim with Trump`s repeated rejections of the Intelligence Community`s conclusions with his reluctance to receiving his daily classified briefings, citing his own smarts.
And with statements like this one from his transition team, ""These are the same people that said Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction."" Well, today, after weeks at the center of the back-and-forth over Russian hacking, working mostly behind the scenes, top intelligence officials finally stepped into the spotlight, putting faces on the faceless Intelligence Community that Trump has been attacking. Appearing on Capitol Hill, the Director of National Intelligence, the Undersecretary of Defense for Intelligence, and the Director of the National Security Agency all testified at the first congressional hearing on the election hack held by the senate Armed Services Committee. The chairman, none other than Senator John McCain.
Now, McCain is no ally of Donald Trump`s but he has remained studiously silent throughout the campaign even as Trump did things like mocking McCain`s time spent as a prisoner of war or insulting a Gold star family. Today, it was finally McCain`s turn to talk, and he went straight for Julian Assange.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
MCCAIN: I believe that he is the one who`s responsible for publishing names of individuals that work for us that put their lives in direct danger. Is that correct?
CLAPPER: Yes, he has.
MCCAIN: And do you think that there`s any credibility we should attach to this individual given his record of --
CLAPPER: Not in my view.
MCCAIN: Not in your view.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
REID: Senator Lindsey Graham, McCain`s closest ally, has been a vocal critic of Trump`s stance on Russia and he asked about the upcoming intelligence briefing.

LINDSEY GRAHAM, SENATOR OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: You`re going to be challenged tomorrow by the President-elect. Are you OK with being challenged?
CLAPPER: Absolutely.
GRAHAM: Do you both welcome that?
CLAPPER: We do.
GRAHAM: Do you think it`s appropriate?
CLAPPER: We do.
GRAHAM: Are you ready for the task?
CLAPPER: I think so.
GRAHAM: Good.

REID: In a pretty remarkable moment, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, who he noted, has served every President since Kennedy, actually criticized the President-elect by implication for his attitude towards the Intelligence Community.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
CLAPPER: I think there is an important distinction here between healthy scepticism, which policymakers -- to include policymaker number one, should always have for intelligence, but I think there is a difference between skepticism and disparagement.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
REID: This comes immediately after the Wall Street Journal reported based on anonymous sources that Trump is planning to revamp the office of the Director of National Intelligence, paring back both that agency and the CIA. Trump`s spokesman strenuously denied that report on a call today with reporters.
SEAN SPICER, TRUMP`S SPOKESMAN: There is no truth to this idea of restructuring the Intelligence Community infrastructure. It`s 100 percent false.
REID: But clearly, someone in Trump`s cabinet -- I mean, in Trump`s orbit thinks that the story is true. Both the associated press and CNN picked it up citing anonymous sources of their own. Now, let`s not forget that Trump has contradicted his team before and he`s claimed to know more about cyber security than the professionals. Here he was at his New Year`s Eve party last weekend.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
TRUMP: I know a lot about hacking and hacking is a very hard thing to prove so it could be somebody else and I also know things that other people don`t know, and so they cannot be sure of the situation.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: What do you know that other people don`t know?
TRUMP: You`ll find out on Tuesday or Wednesday.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
REID: Well, today is Thursday and we have yet to hear Trump`s grand revelation. Tonight, however, NBC news reports according to a senior U.S. intelligence official that U.S. intercepts picked up senior Russian officials celebrating Donald Trump`s election victory as beneficial to Russia. The source also said the U.S. has identified Russian actors who turned over stolen democratic materials to WikiLeaks. According to NBC news, intelligence officials are so worried that Trump won`t accept their findings tomorrow, CIA officials actually called the members of congress asking them for public support in anticipation of a public drubbing by the President-elect.
And joining me now is Congressman Mo Brooks, republican from Alabama and a member of the House Armed Services Committee. And Congressman Brooks, I want to start by sort of getting -- taking the temperature of where you stand. Are you a Julian Assange Republican like Sean Hannity or are you a John McCain Republican and with DNI Clapper and the others who say that Russia was behind the hacking?
MO BROOKS, UNITED STATES CONGRESSMAN: Well, I`ve been on the foreign affairs committee for a number of years and also House Armed Services Committee my entire time in the United States Congress. And I think it`s important to note that you do the best you can with the information that the Intelligence Community gives to you, but nonetheless, there is almost always some elements of doubt because the Intelligence Community rarely has perfect information and they have to draw certain inferences from the information that they have.
So I would agree with Mr. Clapper where he says that there is warranted quite often a healthy degree of skepticism and caution, but ultimately, you have to make decisions based on the best intelligence that you have. Usually it is correct, sometimes it is not. Certainly, the decision to enter into the Iraq War as one of those instances where it was questionable resulted in a very significant decision on the part of the United States, which has been questioned many years thereafter.
REID: And I`m not sure that I got an answer to my question. I mean, you sit on the relevant committees. Who do you believe, Julian Assange and Donald Trump or the Intelligence Community when it comes to Russian hacking? Which one do you believe?
BROOKS: Well, I don`t think that is the right question to ask, because sometimes I will agree with Donald Trump and sometimes --
REID: But on this specific thing --
BROOKS: I agree with-
REID: No, not in - not in general. I mean, on this, on whether or not Russia was behind the hacks. Whose side are you on?
BROOKS: It is a pre -- it is a premature question to ask and it`s not fair to try to place a congressman on one side or the other. I need to be given the kind of information from the Intelligence Community that makes me feel comfortable with the conclusions that they have reached. This is a brand new congress that just started this week. We have not yet had in the House Armed Services Committee or the House Foreign Affairs Committee the kinds of hearings that are necessary for me to have the information to reach the kind of conclusion that you want me to make right now with incomplete evidence.
REID: Well, the senate had one of those such hearings today. They had all of the top leaders of the Intelligence Community before them. I`m assuming that you watched at least some of those hearings or were briefed on them by your staff.
BROOKS: I did.
REID: And you have been a pretty big skeptic about Donald Trump. I mean, during the campaign, you were quite, if not a Never-Trumper, you were extremely skeptical. You said that he`s taken every virtual position on everything that if people really knew that he`d been all over every issue that people would be incredibly skeptical.
BROOKS: But if you --
REID: But, hold on a second.
BROOKS: Wait a minute. If you`d look at --
REID: But now you`re saying you are not prepared -- that you are not prepared to decide whether you believe Julian Assange more or whether you believe the Intelligence Community more? You`re not prepared to decide that right now?
BROOKS: The Senate Armed Services Committee hearing today was public hearing. Classified information, the kind of information that you need to look at to reach your own conclusions as to the veracity of the opinions that are given. That`s a different thing. And so, what we heard today were opinions given from the witnesses. I want to look at the primary evidence. I`m an attorney by training. I`ve prosecuted many a case as a District Attorney and as an Assistant District Attorney. I`ve also defended people on the defense side, and you make decisions based on evidence, not based on hearsay or opinions.
REID: I`m not sure that they were giving their opinions. I think they were giving their considered judgment having investigation. You say they were just giving their opinion?
BROOKS: Well, that`s -- a considered judgment is an opinion.
REID: You think - OK. So let me just-- before I let you go, we are out of time. But who would you say on balance is more credible? Who would you tend to believe more? Julian Assange or DNI Clapper?
BROOKS: Well, my default position is going to be to give the Intelligence Community the benefit of the doubt because after all they do have access to information that has not yet been shared with me as a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee or House Armed Services Committee.
REID: OK. Well, then we have gotten you closer to believing the Intelligence Community over Assange and Donald Trump, so we will consider that to make our conversation -
(CROSSTALK)
BROOKS: But to make -- to make -
REID: Yes?
BROOKS: To have a final opinion, though, I need to see the evidence.
REID: Interesting. All right, well, Congressman Mo Brooks, thank you very much.
BROOKS: Thank you.
REID: I`m joined now by Charlie Pierce, writer at large for Esquire and MSNBC Contributor Charlie Sykes editor of Right Wisconsin. So guys, I don`t know if you are as surprised as I am that when you hear a republican member of congress who sits on the relevant committee, that means on armed services and foreign affairs, that he was not willing to definitively say, Charlie Sykes, that he believes DNI Clapper more than he believes Julian Assange. That is how far the Republican Party has gone. They are willing to just come right out and say ""No, I don`t believe Julian Assange over our own Intelligence Community.""
CHARLIE SYKES, MSNBC CONTRIBUTOR: Yeah, that was extraordinary and somewhat cringe worthy because you, you asked him the easiest question of the year: who do you believe, Julian Assange, who is an anti-American activist who`s hiding out in an embassy or do you believe -- or tend to believe U.S. intelligence agencies? And he really was struggling to give you a straight answer. Look, I am old enough to remember when republicans actually trusted and respected, you know, the U.S. military and our intelligence agencies and actually were not willing to give the benefit of the doubt to either to Vladimir Putin, Russia, or to toadies like Julian Assange.
REID: Yeah, and Charlie Pierce, what`s interesting is if it wasn`t a question of do you believe Donald Trump more or the Intelligence Community because that would have put them in an -- sort of in an intractable bind, right, because he is the guy who`s their President, he`s their guy. But this is Julian Assange. This is not saying do you believe Trump more. It`s saying Julian Assange or the Intelligence Community. He didn`t want to answer.
CHARLIE PIERCE, WRITER AT LARGE FOR ESQUIRE: No, and I mean, unlike my colleague from Milwaukee, I expect nothing from modern republicans, so I wasn`t -- I wasn`t, you know, I wasn`t disappointed or not. I`ll tell you, my favorite moment of the day, though, was Thom Tillis, the senator from North Carolina, making the U.S. lives in a glass house therefore we - therefore - and therefore the - virtually coming right up to the edge of saying we can expect this because it`s karma because what we do -- because of what we do overseas. If any democrat had ever made that argument they`ve have been barbecued on the White House lawn.
REID: It`s incredible --
PIERCE: Frank Church must have been just laughing his head off in senate heaven after that.
REID: I feel that I have to - at that point, I think it`s a perfect point to play this little montage that the great producers here at ALL IN have put together, because it shows where it`s coming from. I mean, these are republicans who are in fear that Trump voters are in their district, they don`t want to walk away from Donald Trump who is with Julian Assange on this, and who has said the following things bout Russia and Putin over lo these many years. Take a listen.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
JOE SCARBOROUGH, HOST OF MORNING JOE: He kills journalists that don`t agree with him.
TRUMP: Well, I think our country does plenty of killing also, Joe.
They say it wasn`t them, it may have been their weapon, but they didn`t use it, they didn`t fire it, it was probably Russia, it was probably people involved with on the pro-Russian side, but I think we have to straighten our own problems out right now, Katy.
Look at it. Bu, you know, the people of Crimea from what I`ve heard would rather be with Russia than where they were, and you have to look at that also.
MARIA BARTIROMO, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK MORNINGS WITH MARIA HOST: If Putin said, ""We`re going to murder somebody in America"" then there`s all this radioactive stuff all over America and you`re President--
TRUMP: Well, if he did it, fine. But I don`t know that he did it.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
REID: Charlie Sykes. I mean, we kill plenty of people as the reaction to Vladimir Putin has had journalists killed is extraordinary for a -- someone who`s going to be President of the United States.
SYKES: It is - it is extraordinary on so many different levels including the moral equivalency that republicans used to dislike. Look, you know one of the things that happened in that really rather remarkable hearing today was there was kind of a bipartisan consensus that we`re not going to let this go. That we`re not going to, you know, just roll over for Donald Trump. I mean, you truly did get some strong rhetoric from John McCain, who`s a Republican. You did get some strong rhetoric from Lindsey Graham.
So I do think that they`re trying to send a signal to him. Look, I know that Donald Trump wants to live in his post-truth alternative reality world but now that he`s going to become President, you know, there are some reality checks here and, you know, the United States Senate, I think -- I thought that hearing did a good job in exposing exactly how thin his position is and how outrageous it is for the President of the United States to be carrying water for Vladimir Putin and the Russians.
REID: Yeah, I have to play this a little piece of sound from Joe Biden today, Vice President Joe Biden, who had some advice for Donald Trump. Let`s take a listen.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: He said -- he said just like -- ""Doing my best to disregard the many inflammatory President O statements and roadblocks. Thought it was going to be a smooth transition - NOT!""
JOE BIDEN, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: Grow up, Donald. Grow up. Time to be an adult. You`re President. You`ve got to do something.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
REID: And Charlie Pierce, you know, I wonder if, you know, we laugh about that and Joe Biden is always delightful to listen to, but there is a sense that Donald Trump has the potential to become pretty isolated here, because there is still a part of the Republican Party that`s with John McCain. That still exists. We don`t know how large it is. The intelligence community is not now some amorphous blob that Donald Trump is tweeting about. It`s those guys with all those bars on their chest that now even Trump supporters can look at those guys and say, wait, they`re not more credible than Julian Assange? Does Donald Trump risk becoming more isolated now?
PIERCE: I have no idea. I think for all intense and purposes in the Republican Party as is presently constituted, John McCain and Lindsey Graham might as well be lawn jockeys. I mean, they have no power. Nobody listens to John McCain. I mean a lot -- a lot of pundits do and some democrats do, but not I mean, the real fire in that committee came from Thom Tillis and Joni Ernst and Deb Fischer and Tom Cotton to an extent, who are the future, and they were not quite -- I mean Lindsey Graham was incredibly amped up today, it was interesting to see. But those were the people who were trying to make the serious argument that, among other things, the current president hasn`t kept us, hasn`t kept our cyber security the way he should have. That having -- that having been said, I think the Republican Party is Donald Trump`s right now.
REID: Charlie Pierce, last word.
PEIRCE: I don`t think he`s isolated at all.
REID: Charlie Sykes, last word to you.
SYKES: Yeah, well, I think that do not underestimate the fact that, that Donald Trump only has a two-vote margin in the United States Senate, so it is not true to say that John McCain and Lindsey Graham do not have a lot of power. I do think that, you know, once you no longer have Barack Obama to kick around anymore, he`s going to own this. And this is going to be -- he`s very, very off message. You know, a guy says, you know, I`m going to fight for America, I want to make America great again. And what is he doing? He`s had this self-inflicted problem again of appeasing Russia.
REID: Yeah. The Charlies, great tonight. Charlie Pierce and Charlie Sykes, thank you guys both for being here, appreciate it.
All right, and coming up, the fight over Trump`s cabinet. Why top democrats are demanding an ethics investigation into his pick to lead the Department of Health and Human Services.
But first, NBC has exclusive new details from the top-secret report on Russia`s hacking. Evan McMullin will be here to break down the intelligence findings that Donald Trump refuses to accept. That`s just after the break.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
CLAPPER: The Russians have a long history of interfering in elections, theirs and other peoples. But I don`t think that we`ve ever encountered a more aggressive or direct campaign to interfere in our election process than we`ve seen in this case.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
REID: What exactly did Russia do to interfere with the U.S. election? NBC`s Hallie Jackson has exclusive details.
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
HALLIE JACKSON, NBC NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Tonight, an exclusive inside look at a top secret report on Russia, one that went directly to President Obama today. So, what does it reveal? Two top intelligence officials with direct knowledge of the report tell NBC news, a detailed Russian cyber- attacks against not just the Democratic National Committee, but the White House, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the State Department, even American companies. Some hacks successful, others thwarted. The report explains Moscow`s motives, partly to disrupt the democratic process and partly as payback. The intelligence analysts conclude, for the Obama administration`s questioning of Vladimir Putin`s legitimacy as President. It`s not just last year`s Presidential campaign either. The report tracks Russian cyber activity back to 2008 and 2012. It does not speculate on whether Russia`s interference affected the outcome of 2016.
While President Obama says today, he has full faith in the conclusions of that report. President-elect Trump, who will get the same briefing tomorrow, has seemed skeptical of the intelligence community so far.
The president of NBC Chicago`s Carol Marin --
BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: When the President-elect receives his own briefings and is able to examine the intelligence as his team is put together and they see how professional and effective these agencies are that some of those current tensions will be reduced.
JACKSON: Hallie Jackson, NBC News, the White House.
(END VIDEOTAPE)
REID: And Donald Trump has apparently, has already responded to that NBC news report, tweeting ""How did NBC get `an exclusive look into the top secret report he, Obama, was presented?` Who gave them this report and why. Politics.""
Joining me now to talk about what we`re learning in white manors is Nada Bakos, a former CIA Analyst and author of the upcoming book ""The Targeter"", and Evan McMullin, former CIA Operations Officer and former Independent Presidential Candidate. Thank you both for being here. And Nada, I`m going to start with you on that, putting aside Donald Trump still questioning, now questioning where NBC got the report rather than responding to what`s in it. I was really interested in one piece of what we just heard. The idea that part of this was payback by Vladimir Putin for the Obama administration questioning his legitimacy as president. Is it just me who sees constant mirrors in the things Vladimir Putin thinks and the things that Donald Trump obsesses about?
NADA BAKOS, FORMER CIA ANALYST: Look, Russia has been playing this game with the United States for close to 70 years, at this point, so most of what Russia does should not surprise us. The spying game is what it is, it`s true. But on the same hand, accepting that a foreign government could possibly be, not only in the United States, within our election system, is unfathomable to me. And to essentially pick the side of a foreign government and a possible international criminal, Julian Assange, over the men and women who work hard to keep this country safe. That to me, I would not have expected.
REID: And Evan McMullin, I do have to throw it back to you because, you know, in our previous segment we did speak with a republican member of congress who was -- he was never a pro-Trump republican during the primary but he seemed to find it really difficult not even just to say he doesn`t believe the intelligence services, which is shocking in and of itself, but to even put distance between himself and Julian Assange, how we got into the point where now the indemnified individuals include Vladimir Putin and Julian Assange when it comes to republicans?
EVAN MCMULLIN, FORMER CIA OPERATIONS OFFICER AND FORMER INDEPENDENT PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Yeah, it`s truly unfortunate, I mean in the earlier segment when you asked a similar question to Charlie Sykes, I thought he gave the excellent answer. I mean, it`s the easiest possible question that you could have given the representative, and he botched it, but it shows you just how unrecognizable elements of the Republican Party are these days. It`s absolutely unfathomable to me that we have a -- even a question about whether we trust our intelligence professionals over an anti-American activist supported by Russia.
REID: And Nada, I want to talk now about some of the things that we actually heard today in that hearing. Some of which was actually quite frightening, the idea of what could happen, what could go wrong. Let`s start by playing DNI Clapper, who talked about what the response to such cyber warfare could in theory be. Take a listen.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
CLAPPER: When something major happens in cyberspace, our automatic default policy position should not be exclusively to counter cyber with cyber. We should consider all instruments of national power. Unlike nuclear weapons, cyber capabilities are difficult to see and evaluate and are ephemeral.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
REID: And Nada, is there anything that the U.S. has in its arsenal, sort of in its kit bag, to respond to what has happened during our elections right now that Russia would now already know about or be prepared for?
BAKOS: I think that`s a very good question. One that I would not want to answer on live TV. However, I do think -- and I agree with Senator Graham today, he said in the Armed Services Committee hearing that there are other things the United States should be doing besides the sanctions and declaring the diplomats persona non grata. Someone like, you know, place like Russia, Putin, authoritarian regimes don`t find that to be very intimidating. I think there is more that we should be doing.
REID: And Evan, you know, one of the other pieces that`s come out of NBC, you know, this is what journalists do, they, they obtain some advanced word on what`s in this report, and one of the striking things is that they said they`ve identified Russian actors who were involved in turning this information over to WikiLeaks. Does it get more definitive than that or is there still reason to consider that as Congressman Brooks said, just an opinion?
MCMULLIN: No, that`s pretty damming information, I mean, without seeing the specifics. But I will say that it`s interesting that Julian Assange in his interview with Fox News the other day when he was asked ""did you receive the information from the Russian government?"" He was very careful to answer the question in a particular way. He denied receiving the information from the Russian government but did not say that he didn`t receive it from a third party who could have been working for the Russian government. If you go back and watch that interview, it`s -- he`s very careful in how he talks. So you know, I think the question that was posed to him, you know, wasn`t - where was one that let him off the hook but it seemed clear that there was a cut out, and it was interesting to hear that from this report tonight.
REID: And you know, Nada, having been in the position of dealing with an administration that was putting pressure on analysts to come to a politically desirous conclusion, something they wanted, in your case during the run up to the Iraq War, give us a preview of how difficult it could be for analysts if they`re already hearing that the incoming administration wants to somewhat, you know, take apart the CIA and other agencies. It sounds like as punishment for coming to a conclusion they don`t like.
BAKOS: Well, it does sounds like that on the surface. Certainly, I am - what Trump is saying in his tweets and what we`re reading in media. But the difference between what we dealt with, with the Bush administration and the questioning of our analysis, I think, is very different than what the analysts are going to say to the Trump administration. Under George W. Bush, there was a mutual respect, there`s a respect for the office in addition from the intelligence work and there was an understanding of how hard the intelligence analyst work. So I think facing a situation where your job itself is diminished, is entirely different than what we had to deal with questioning our analysis.
REID: Yeah, absolutely. Evan, I`ll give you the last word because you ran for President. Did you ever thought you`d live to see the day when an incoming President of the United States essentially set aside the joint findings of all of our intelligence agencies in favor of you know, a guy hiding out in the Ecuadorian embassy in London.
MCMULLEN: No, but even more importantly, I never thought I would see a President-elect in the United States or a President that would align himself or herself with the very adversary that is attacking our democracy. That`s the underlying source for the tension between the CIA and Donald Trump. It`s his general threat to this country through his policies and through his alignment with Vladimir Putin. That`s the deeper issue here. It`s not you know, the capability of our intelligence analysts or anything else really. It is -- that`s the deeper issue. Donald Trump will blame it on the Iraq War and a range of other things that he can point to, but that is the deeper issue.
REID: Yeah, indeed. Nada Bakos and Evan McMullen, thank you both for being here, appreciate it.
And coming up, flooding the zone, republicans staff hearings for six of Trump`s cabinet picks on a single day -- the same day Trump claims he`ll hold his first press conference in over five months. That`s ahead.
REID: According to the New York Post, Donald Trump recently told the new Senate Minority leader, Charles Schumer, that he likes Schumer more than he likes republican leaders in Congress, but it sure didn`t seem that way this morning when Trump unleashed a tweet storm that started off like this. ""The democrats led by head clown Chuck Schumer know how bad Obamacare is and what a mess they`re in. Instead of working to fix it, they do the typical political thing and blame."" Shortly after Trump`s tweets, Schumer made the news regarding Trump`s pick to lead the Department of Health and Human Services.
Representative Tom Price, who the Wall Street Journal reports, traded more than $300,000 in shares of health-related companies over the past four years while sponsoring and advocating legislation that could potentially affect those companies` stocks. Trading stocks in companies while pushing legislation affecting those companies, is not exactly draining the swamp stuff. And this morning, Schumer, called for the non-partisan office of congressional ethics, the group that the GOP recently tried and failed to dismantle, to investigate. The senate hearing on Price isn`t scheduled yet, but a bunch of hearings have been scheduled for next week on Trump`s Cabinet picks and the schedule suggests team Trump is doing everything it can to make sure the news that comes out of those hearings gets buried. I`ll explain, next.
REID: The confirmation hearings for Trump`s cabinet picks kick off next week, and while some hearings are yet to be scheduled. Have a look at this, there are hearings for six different Cabinet members all scheduled for the same day, next Wednesday. Including what would be day two of hearings for Attorney General pick Jeff Sessions, who civil rights groups oppose due to his past and allegations of racism. Wednesday will also be the day for hearings for Secretary of State pick Rex Tillerson, the ExxonMobil CEO with close ties to Russia; and Education Secretary pick Betsy DeVos, who has long favored charter schools and vouchers over public schools. Also, that day, Trump has claimed via Twitter, that he`ll hold his first press conference since July, on Wednesday. Though it remains to be seen whether he`ll actually do that, since he`s claimed he`d have press conferences in the past and it never happened.
The packed schedule could ensure that the headlines from the hearings will get buried, which may be the point. We should note that back in January of 2009, four of President Obama`s picks had hearings on the same day, those picks were far less controversial. There were two fewer candidates and the President-elect, hadn`t claimed he was holding a press conference. By the way, it`s not just about what the hearing - when the hearings take place but the kind of scrutiny that candidates will receive and there`s actually more. And one of our next guests has broken some news on that front and we will explain next.
And joining me now is MSNCB Contributor -- next is now -- Joan Walsh; National Affairs Correspondent for The Nation and Professor Jason Johnson, Politics Editor at the Root. Magic.
REID: All right, Joan.
JOAN WALSH, NATIONAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT FOR THE NATION: Wow!
REID: You have a scoop on, not just the what and the when, but the mechanics of this upcoming hearings for Jeff Sessions.
WALSH: Yes. I mean, advocates - not just advocates -- Senator Feinstein, who`s now the Chair of the Judiciary Committee, Senator Leahy, he was the past chair. They have asked for more time, because Jeff Sessions has not completed his judiciary questionnaire. It`s woefully incomplete. And there`s a lot to get through. I mean, the man had three days of hearings when he was rejected for a Federal Judgeship.
REID: Right.
WALSH: It`s great that he got himself elected from the state of Alabama, but that`s not the same as being prepared to be the top law enforcement officer. So, they`ve been asking for more time, they`ve been asking for more witnesses but Chairman Grassley has said no. Yesterday, came out with a schedule. The democrats will get four witnesses.
REID: Only four witnesses?
WALSH: Only four witnesses, and it will be only two days and there will be no delay despite the woefully inadequate disclosures that he`s made.
REID: And that Jason, that seems, first of all, shocking that you could - could possibly limit the democrats to only four people, four witnesses that can testify. Does that sound like it`s feasible to get through all of the past that baggage, that Jeff Sessions is dragging with him to Washington?
JASON JOHNSON, POLITICS EDITOR AT THE ROOT: It`s - it takes a long time to lay out how much of a bigot he is. And, you know, and so, I think that - and here`s the thing that I think is important. Given the fact that, again, this guy was rejected, you know, 30 years ago, he has statements today. And I think that one of the things that any witness would want to do is say; look, it`s not just that he may be a bigot. But there are consequences to that attitude being in this position and that requires time, that requires witnesses, that`s clearly not something the republican congress wants to do, and there will be bad consequences for rushing this through when he has to actually adjudicate on behalf of this nation.
REID: And Joan, do you have reporting on - now that it`s going to be a scramble, the Civil Rights Groups and others that oppose Sessions are going to have to choose, right? Because you got criminal justice reform issues with him; you`ve got obviously direct race issues, but you also have voting rights.
WALSH: You`ve got voting rights, you`ve got banking. You know, there`s just - there`s so much. It`s going to be very hard to choose those four witnesses. But you know, what people have told me, which is kind of interesting, they`re very upset about this truncated hearing, but they`re also saying they will push senators to bring some of this stuff up on the floor. When this goes to a vote, assuming he`s going to get out of committee, which he will. There is a lot of push for progressive democratic senators to oppose him, to talk about his record and we`ll see what they can get away with under Mitch McConnell, but the battle does not end what the haring ends next Wednesday.
REID: Yeah. And we know there were - there were civil disobedience in Alabama about Jeff Sessions. Have you got any reporting Jason, that there`s going to be similar civil disobedience actually in Washington?
JOHNSON: There will be - there will be people that are talking about it now. The issue is going to be this. It`s just like we saw with the phone calls earlier this week, you`ve got to put pressure on these senators. You`ve got to make that clear, because you know, Heidi Heitkamp, you know, you got democrats where in red states, who were going to say, ""I can`t oppose Trump."" They need to get phone calls, otherwise, pretty much all these nominees, all these confirmations are going to go.
REID: Yeah. Because Heidi Heitkamp mentioned some of those (INAUDIBLE). Let`s talk about those six people all at one time. How are democrats deciding how to apportion their time, if they`ve got to deal with Tillerson, and DeVos, and Sessions, et cetera, all at the same time?
WALSH: They`re scrambling. I mean, you know, Senator Feinstein wants to be able to grill Mike Pompeo as the CIA Director. She may have to choose between her own hearing and going to talking to him about torture. I mean, this is just unprecedented it`s given - as you made the point earlier, Barack Obama`s Cabinet was, by and large, a lot of senators, lot of known quantities -- Eric Holder had just been confirmed for a job two years before, so he`d been vetted already.
There are lots of people with a lot of years and years of vetting. These people are brand new to the jobs they`re going to do, and in fact, a lot of them want to dismantle the agencies they`re supposed to lead and protect. So, there are a lot of questions, there`s a lot that remains unknown, nobody to my knowledge has completed their Senate disclosures.
JOHNSON: Right, right.
REID: Yeah.
WALSH: So, you know, you`re supposed to have time to look at it, have your staff look at it, talk it over, think about what you`re going to ask. They`re going to get this stuff the night before, so, you know, democrats are scrambling. They`re angry, but they`re hanging pretty tough. I`m kind of impressed.
REID: Jason?
JOHNSON: Joy, you know, how many times can you apply for a job of importance without filling out the application? Because half of these people, they haven`t filled out the application. So, the democrats, you know, they have to play whack-a-mole with all these different people who are going through. And I`ll give you one example, you know - you know, the education pick, right? This is some of their so many different issues connected because now we have Criminal Justice with education. Now we have, you know, school violence in education. She doesn`t have any history on these issues and I know that some school choice advocates think that you`re always going to end up in dead poets` society, and it going to be nice, but this requires work. And I hope that the democrats can lay out a plan where even if a lot of these people get through, they at least can put out the message, ""Hey, we stood tough, when some of these people didn`t know the job.
REID: Yeah, yeah, then tough and fast. Because it`s going to be in two days - two days` work. Joan Walsh and Jason Johnson, thank you.
JOHNSON AND WALSH: Thank you.
REID: All right, and coming up, another democrat announces plans to boycott Trump`s inauguration, and she`s here to tell me why. But first, tonight`s cocktail-themed: Thing 1, Thing 2 starts just after this break. Stay with us.
REID: Thing 1, news today that Donald Trump is scheduled to meet tomorrow with the editors of the Conde Nast media empire. Surprisingly, one of the people who`s expected to be included in that meeting is Vanity Fair Editor, Graydon Carter, a man long considered one of Trump`s oldest rivals. Trump and Carter have openly feuded with one another since the 1980s, when a young Carter writing for Spy Magazine, first dubbed the real estate mogul, ""a short-fingered Vulgarian.""
You may remember that rivalry was reunited -- reignited recently, when a writer for Vanity Fair gave a scathing review of Trump`s midtown Manhattan restaurant, the Trump Grill. That prompted Trump to tweet, quote, ""Has anyone looked at the really poor numbers of Vanity Fair Magazine way down, big trouble, dead. Graydon Carter, no talent, will be out.""
Despite Trump`s attempt to discredit the magazine, other journalists showed up at Trump Grill to confirm that the quality of the food and drink was indeed horrible. Which is how we got this photo from The Daily Beast, Olivia Nuzzi, of a Trump Grill martini. Apparently, served extra, extra, extra dirty on the rocks and in a wine glass. Now, that doesn`t look appetizing to you, maybe that you`d prefer this slightly less disgusting looking drink from Trump`s cocktail bar in D.C. That is, until you hear what it costs, and that, is Thing 2, in 60 seconds.
REID: Today, with just two weeks to go before he becomes President, Donald Trump spent his day testifying in a lawsuit against a celebrity chef. Trump, brought the lawsuit himself after chef Jose Andres backed out of a deal to open a restaurant in Trump`s D.C. Hotel. Citing objections to Trump`s anti-immigrant rhetoric. But not to worry, you can still eat and drink at Trump`s D.C. Hotel, that is, if you can afford it.
The Washingtonian has discovered that the bar in Trump`s D.C. Hotel, has raised its drink prices twice since opening last September. So that now, the cheapest drink on the menu costs a whopping $24. Now, if you`re wondering what`s the most expensive drink on the menu, well, that distinction belongs to what is essentially a vodka oyster shooter, with caviar that clocks in at $100 even. Very Russian. Not a cocktail fan? Maybe you`d like to try a bit of their finest Hungarian wine, which they serve by the crystal spoonful. Literally, by the spoonful. It prices ranging from $15 to $140, not for a glass, but a spoonful of wine. Hard to imagine anyone spending that much money at any bar but with inauguration day just around the corner, I`ll bet there are a few people in Washington who are badly in need of a drink.
REID: In 15 days, Donald J. Trump will become the 45th President of the United States. And politicians are refusing to attend his inauguration, risk flouting years of precedent. So, just this week, Bill and Hillary Clinton announced that they would be going. The Clintons, will join George W. Bush and his wife Laura, who cited the chance to, quote, ""witness the peaceful transfer of power, a hallmark of American democracy.""
And Jimmy Carter, with his announcement last month, was the first former president to RSVP for the inaugural. But there are few prominent politicians who are making other plans.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I`ve been to, let me see, two Clinton inaugurations. I`ve been to two of them for Bush, been two of them for Obama. I`m not going to this inauguration. I can`t go to this inauguration because he continues to spew hatred, bigotry, and prejudice. Even after he said he was going to bring us all together, he was going to unify us, but he`s not.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
REID: Well now, today, a lawmaker from Massachusetts, with a history of being a bit of a rebel, announced that she would also boycott the inauguration. And she`ll be here to tell us why after the break.
REID: One member of congress won`t be attending Donald Trump`s inauguration in 15 days. Massachusetts Congresswoman, Katherine Clark, and she joins me now. Congresswoman Clark, thank you for being here tonight. Explain to us why you are going to abrogate this tradition of both parties showing up for the inauguration of the President no matter what party he`s in?
KATHERINE CLARK, REPRESENTATIVE FOR MASSACHUSETTS`S 5TH CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT: Thank you, Joy, for having me. And let me tell you what my thinking is on this. Since the election, Donald Trump announced, on election night, that he was going to be a President for all Americans. And over the past few weeks, we have continued to see him building on hateful rhetoric of the campaign and I am hearing from my constituents, whether I meet them in the supermarket, in their living rooms, at large gatherings we`ve had at churches and universities, true fear about what is coming from this administration.
So, for this inauguration, I believe in the peaceful transition of power. I believe and respect the Office of the President, but the fear that I`m seeing, the rise in hate crimes, and the really continuation of the divisive rhetoric coming out of the President-elect, has led me to believe that my place is not with the pageantry and it is not right at this time to normalize this Presidency.
REID: And you joined on John Lewis in leading that civil disobedience on the house floor for which the house speaker wants to fine you all nick time. Do you expect that there`ll be more civil disobedience in -- as Trump takes office, and including from lawmakers?
CLARK: I think we are going to do whatever we can to fight for the American people. I think, when we are looking at people losing healthcare, when we are looking at their -- the rise of hate crimes in our communities, when we are seeing nominees who are diametrically opposed to the mission of their agencies, there is so much fear and foreboding that I think we will do what we can in the minority to make the American people`s voices heard here in the Capitol.
REID: And what do you say to potentially -- or have any of your colleagues on the other side, I should just say, had any comment for you about not coming to the inauguration.
CLARK: No. I think that people understand this is a personal decision for me, that I think reflects what I`m hearing from my constituents. And I, you know, I know that many of my colleagues across the aisle did not attend Barack Obama`s. But I see this as very different because this is a continuation of the divisive and hateful rhetoric, and I know that many of us are concerned about what we`re seeing from the President-elect. Whether it`s his unwillingness to divest from his business interests and put America`s interest first, or whether it`s his critique of our intelligence agencies and the public servants. The men and women who work for us so hard and choosing foreign powers over our own intelligence agencies. These are the issues that have led to my decision and it`s one that I have great support from my district on.
REID: And very quickly, a lot of people have been, you know, saying to me, I`m sure same to you, that they want to know what to do. Some action items, things they can do for their own personal resistance that will make them feel they`re at least doing something rather than just being sad about the election. What would you advise them? Very quickly.
CLARK: This is the number one thing that I hear, and I think it`s remain vigilant, remain engaged. Just this week, with the thousands of phone calls that Americans put into the republican majority in the House saying, ""Do not do away with the independent ethics oversight."" The republican`s changed course because of that public pressure.
REID: Right.
CLARK: And that`s what I`m urging all Americans to watch, remain vigilant, and remain engaged.
REID: All right.
CLARK: This is your government.
REID: Indeed. Indeed. Congresswoman, Katherine Clark, thank you so much for joining us and kudos on that great civics lesson for us. Thank you very much
CLARK: Thank you, Joy.
REID: And that is ALL IN for this evening. ""THE RACHEL MADDOW SHOW"", starts right now. Rachel, it`s a little bit of a tongue-twister at the end. Katherine Clark was great.
THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED."
0	30	 31 von 72	MSNBC	January 5, 2017 Thursday	 MTP DAILY	 5:00 PM EST	"HIGHLIGHT: He highlighted accomplishments of the state department; Washington Post reports that they did end up reinstating an old rule called the Holman rule. General Clapper has very high confidence that Russia was behind the hacks. President Obama states he has full faith in the conclusions of the intelligence briefing and hopes to see reduced tensions between Trump and the intel community. General Clapper will release a public report on the Russian hacks next week. Clapper also states that these Russian hacks are the most aggressive election interference we have seen. A political panel discussing Donald Trump and the hacking issue with Russia. Senator McCain says that Americans should be alarmed by Russia`s attacks on our nation and the hacking is an unprecedented attack on our democracy. Trump threatened Toyota on Twitter. Weekly jobless claims are below the estimates. Bernie Sanders has a one-on-one with Chuck Todd live. Sanders says that repealing Obamacare would be insane without a rational alternative in place.

"	"CHUCK TODD, MSNBC HOST: Yes, it`s Thursday.
The Senate begins the search for answers over Russian hacking.
Tonight, showdown, the U.S. intelligence community fights back against Donald Trump over Russia.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
GEN. JAMES CLAPPER, DIRECTOR, NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE: I think there is a difference between skepticism and disparagement.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
TODD: We`ll talk to a Republican senator who questioned those intelligence chiefs today. Tom Cotton of Arkansas. 
Plus, feeling the burn, again. Does Bernie Sanders have the answer for Democrats in the fight against President-elect Trump?
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (D), VERMONT: Mr. Trump right now has got to do one of two things.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
TODD: I sit down with Bernie Sanders coming up.
This is MTP DAILY and it starts right now.
Well, good evening. I`m Chuck Todd here in Washington, feeling a tad bit better, I promise. Welcome to MTP DAILY.
Senator Bernie Sanders, who`s become the spiritual leader, of sorts, of the progressive opposition to Trump, will be joining me later in the program to discuss the Democratic Party`s counter-attack against Trump`s attempts to repeal Obamacare.
We`ll also dive into some tough questions about the future of the Democratic Party in the age of Trump.
But we begin tonight with an unprecedented rift involving President-elect Trump, the U.S. intelligence community he`s about to command and the Republican Congress over a matter of national security.
Today, the full extent of those divisions were exposed, right on national television. The top U.S. intelligence chiefs from the State Department, our top spy agency and the NSA, all testified on Capitol Hill, defending themselves against President-elect Trump`s charges that they`re wrong about Russia`s interference in our election. And that their intelligence has somehow been politicized.
Their testimony also came as Republicans on the Hill are increasingly divided, calling Russia`s actions everywhere from an act of war on one end of the spectrum, to a public service on the other.
So, today, just one day before he briefs Trump personally on this issue, the director of national intelligence, James Clapper, made it clear he`s more certain than ever about who is responsible for the hacks and why they did it.
Clapper specifically referenced October`s intelligence assessment that said this. The Russian government directed the hacks and they were explicitly intended to interfere with the U.S. election process. Here`s more from Clapper.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
CLAPPER: We stand actually more resolutely on the strength of that statement that we made on the seventh of October.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
TODD: Clapper also went a step further saying Russia`s interference in our election involved more than just hacking.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
CLAPPER: This was a multi-facetted campaign, so the hacking was only one part of it. And it also entailed of, you know, classical propaganda, dysfunction, fake news.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
TODD: He also fired back at accusations that the intel community was politicizing its work saying, quote, ""I am apolitical.""
And when Democratic Senator Claire McCaskill asked him about Trump`s, quote, ""trashing of the intel community,"" which, by the way, Vice President-elect Pence downplayed it as healthy American skepticism, here`s what Clapper said.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
CLAPPER: There is an important distinction here between healthy skepticism, which policymakers, to include policy-maker number one, should always have for intelligence. But I think there is a difference between skepticism and disparagement.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
TODD: And, with an assist from the committee`s chairman, John McCain, Clapper also took an apparent swipe at Trump for citing WikiLeaks founder, Julian Assange, who has also rejected U.S. intelligence on Russian hacking.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
SEN. JOHN MCCAIN (R), ARIZONA: Director, how would you describe Mr. Assange?
CLAPPER: I don`t think those of us in the intelligence community have a whole lot of respect for him.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
TODD: All of this comes as Clapper, along with other top intelligence officials, meet with Trump tomorrow in a highly publicized, but supposedly secret briefing, which will lay out the Intelligence Committee`s full report on Russia`s interference with our election.
I`m now by Republican Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas. He was part of that hearing, as a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee.
And, by the way, he`s also a member of the Senate`s Select Committee on Intelligence. So, he`s as well briefed as anybody on this issue.
Senator Cotton, welcome back to Washington. Happy New Year. And great beard.
[17:05:04] SEN. TOM COTTON (R), ARKANSAS: Thank you, Chuck. Happy New Year to all of your viewers. I decided to grow a beard in honor of Tony Kornheiser. And now, I`m just going to make it orange and maybe he`ll have me on the radio show.
TODD: There we go, a little La Cheeserie (ph) to you.
Let`s start with this. There seems to be a bit of a gulp (ph) inside the Republican Party. You`ve got John McCain referring to what Russia did as an act of war. Donald Trump says nobody knows. What do you say?
COTTON: Well, I believe the October seventh intelligence assessment that Russian intelligence services or their affiliates were behind the hacking of the DNC and John Podesta`s e-mail.
We still need to wait for the report that will be released imminently to see about what they have to say about the motive for those decisions.
But I would also say that this is just one small example of a pattern of aggression that Russia has committed against the United States in our interests for many years, going back at least 15 years since Vladimir Putin took office.
And what we need to do is to focus on drawing new boundaries on Russia, not just about this small instance of Russian aggression in U.S. interests, but so many others, running illegal spy rings in our country, beating our diplomats on the steps of our embassy in Moscow, giving weapons to rebels that could shoot civilian aircraft out of sky, intervening in Syria and bombing our supportive forces there.
So, this is just one long -- one part of a long pattern of Russian aggression against U.S. interests.
TODD: Everything you just ticked down there, are you concerned that President-elect Trump would dis -- would basically be dismissive of what you just said?
COTTON: I`m not concerned about it. I hope that he appreciates the kind of aggression that Russian has -- Russia has undertaken, especially in the last eight years.
And I`ll make a point to you and your viewers that I met the Armed Services Committee today. Donald Trump campaigned on increasing our defense budget, on accelerating our nuclear modernization, on expanding ballistic missile defense against adversarial nations, and accelerating oil and gas production which is harmful to Russia`s petro economy.
All of these things fundamentally change the strategic calculation for Russia as against the United States. So, it`s not clear to me why someone would think that Donald Trump would be the favorite candidate of Russia. Hillary Clinton was opposed to all those things.
So, I`ll be looking forward to seeing the declassified version of the report that comes out in the -- in the next few days.
But, also, on the Intelligence Committee going forward with our very careful review of this entire matter.
TODD: But should motivation matter here? You know, in some ways, I mean, I feel like it -- should that -- I think that, perhaps, this is the problem that even the president-elect gets caught up in this idea of, oh, it`s an attempt to delegitimize the election.
COTTON: Well, unfortunately, --
TODD: If Russia was getting involved, it should -- that shouldn`t matter. What should matter is what are we going to do about it, correct?
COTTON: Chuck, the -- so you got the motives of Vladimir Putin and his intelligence services. Those are always hard to know. As I asked director Clapper today, and he confirmed, trying to learn the motives and intentions and plans of fortune leaders about any topic is the hardest thing we ask of our intelligence services.
But then, you`ve got the motives of some Democrats and some in the media who are using a phrase like hacked the election or hacked into our electoral process. That is creating the confusion, amongst some, that somehow Vladimir Putin and Russian intelligence services manipulated vote totals. And was said repeatedly today, there`s no evidence to support that at all.
We need to focus on the actual facts at hand which is that Russian intelligence services, or their affiliates, hacked into the DNC and John Podesta`s e-mail. Whatever the motive was for that, they ought not to have done it. They ought to pay a price for it.
I think the price should be stiffer than what President Obama imposed last week. But that`s a policy that I`ve had going back four years in the Congress of trying to draw a firmer line against Vladimir Putin`s aggression against the United States and the United States allies and our interests abroad.
TODD: Well, it`s interesting you bring up retaliation. Let me play for you what your colleague, Lindsey Graham -- an exchange Lindsey Graham had with Clapper today. Take a listen.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R), SOUTH CAROLINA: When it comes to interfering in our election, we better be ready to throw rocks. Do you agree with that?
CLAPPER: That`s a good metaphor.
GRAHAM: I think what Obama did was throw a pebble. I`m ready to throw a rock. Is this going to stop until we make the cost higher?
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We have got to change the dynamic here because we`re on the wrong end of the cost equation.
GRAHAM: Yes, you got that right.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
TODD: All right. What`s the rock, as far as you`re concerned, Senator Cotton?
COTTON: Well, Lindsey may be willing to settle with rocks. I`d move on to boulders, though. I`ve long -- I`ve long advocated an across-the-board approach to Russia that puts more pressure on them.
The Obama administration has frequently said they compartmentalize issues with Russia. Ukraine, on the one hand. Syria, on the other hand. They may compartmentalize it. Vladimir Putin does not. And simply because we face, for instance, a cyberattack here doesn`t mean that we have to respond in kind with that.
We might, for instance, provide the defensive weapons that the Ukrainian military has been asking for so forcefully for so long. We might crack down on the travel of Russian spies here in the United States that aren`t supposed to be leaving their embassy under existing rules. But the Obama administration has let them do so, presumably, so they can conduct further espionage.
[17:10:10] There`s a whole host of options that we have for drawing a firmer line on Russia. Some of those are bilateral, like I just outlined. But some of them are moving forward with Donald Trump`s proposals, like building up our military or expanding missile defense in our nuclear arsenal or accelerating the export of oil and gas now that we`re one of the world`s largest producers.
TODD: Let me go -- let me go to Ukraine. You brought up Ukraine. Let me go to that a minute. What happens -- there`s been some chatter that President-elect Trump is, perhaps, willing to dial down the sanctions that were imposed to the illegal annexation of Crimea.
Obviously, it -- Europe has never been -- it`s been hard to keep Europe -- those European end of those sanctions in place. If there`s any wavering by the U.S. president, those things are going to fall apart. How concerned are you about that?
COTTON: Well, I`ve been concerned about the sanctions that were imposed after the invasion of Crimea for almost three years now. Because, as you say, the greatest source of wavering has been the European governments.
And some of those governments have recently have changed and expressed more skepticism towards them. I think it would be inadvisable not to renew those sanctions when they`re next up in a few months. At least, in return, not getting any -- or not getting anything substantial in return.
So, I think that would be inadvisable and that`s not the path I would take.
TODD: One final question, domestic. Very -- just a -- and I say very quickly and health care is not a quick subject. How -- are you comfortable with the idea of repealing Obamacare before a replacement is ready to go?
COTTON: Well, Chuck, I think you have to distinguish, when you take about a replacement, when it`s enacted and when it takes effect. Obamacare, itself, was enacted in March of 2010 but some measures didn`t take effect for another few years.
I think that we, as Republicans, need to coalesce and pass a solution that solves the problems that Obamacare actually made worse. Now, that may not take effect until, say, the open season of 2018 because you need to provide for an orderly transition.
But I think it would not be the right path for us to repeal Obamacare without laying out a path forward, even if the path, say, transitions gradually over the next year to two years.
TODD: But you`re saying you`re not going to vote -- you`re not comfortable voting on a repeal without at least some concrete -- something concrete in place that people can see.
COTTON: I think that when we repeal Obamacare, we need to have the solution in place moving forward. Again, that solution may be implemented in a delivered fashion. But I don`t think we can just repeal Obamacare and say we`re going to get the answer two years from now.
Look, this is a very complicated problem. Health care is a very complex issue. We haven`t coalesced around the solution for six years, in part because it is so complicated. Kicking the can down the road for a year or two years is not going to make it any easier to solve.
TODD: Senator Tom Cotton, Republican from Arkansas, appreciate you coming on. Nice talking with you, sir.
COTTON: Thanks, Chuck.
All right, let me bring in tonight`s panel. Nathan Gonzales is the Editor of ""The Rothenberg and Gonzales Political Report."" Sara Fagen was Bush 43`s political director, now a CNBC Contributor. And Eugene Robinson, Pulitzer Prize winning columnist for ""The Washington Post"" and an MSNBC Political Analyst. Welcome all.
Nathan, what did you make of today`s hearing, and is it -- does it all sort of -- we all have to wait to see how Donald Trump digests it?
NATHAN GONZALES, EDITOR, ""THE ROTHENBERG AND GONZALES POLITICAL REPORT"": Well, I think this is a good example. Democrats want to paint Republicans with a broad brush that everybody agrees with Donald Trump, I think is a good example where Republicans aren`t on the same page.
Where does this end up, I think, will depend a lot on the hearings that are -- or whenever the reports come out over the next couple of days.
But I think we have to remember coming out of the campaign that Donald Trump is being given more of the benefit of the doubt than what politicians or what people that are viewed as government insiders.
So, when information comes out, even though it might seem logical, some people are still going to side with president Trump because he`s still perceived as this outsider.
TODD: How -- I mean -- go ahead, Sara. I mean, I --
SARA FAGEN, CONTRIBUTOR, CNBC: I think that`s right. I think he gets more of a pass on misinformation or maybe strong statements, you know, to the contrary of what these Republican senators who were farther to the right than President Obama on what the reaction to Russia should be.
TODD: Right.
FAGEN: And so, --
TODD: They have been for years. Basically, everybody in the Republican Party, other than --
FAGEN: Right.
TODD: -- Dana Rohrabacher --
FAGEN: Right.
TODD: -- and Donald Trump.
EUGENE ROBINSON, MSNBC POLITICAL ANALYST: Yes.
FAGEN: So, Obama is the centrist on this. And you -- on one side you have, you know, Senate Republicans and on the other side you have Trump. And so, that`s an odd place for the Republican Party to be.
But I agree with Nathan. I think, you know, Trump very effectively, you know, uses the bully pulpit to say, you know, this is media. This is about delegitimizing the election which, you know, some Democrats have taken this too far. You know, it`s -- I don`t think it`s credible to say that Hillary Clinton lost because of that.
TODD: Most people have -- you know, that does seem as if it`s a bit of a - - let me deny something that isn`t happening so much (ph). That isn`t being said that much. That`s all I`m saying.
ROBINSON: Partly -- right. People aren`t saying that.
(CROSSTALK)
TODD: More people are saying, you didn`t go to Michigan.
ROBINSON: Exactly.
FAGEN: The perception on (INAUDIBLE) and by voters.
TODD: The right is fuming it though. Trump is fueling it to create this perception.
ROBINSON: Exactly. I think the perception is being made by Trump. I don`t hear people saying that, independent of what -- or despite what Trump claims. I just don`t hear that.
[17:15:06] What I hear is, yes, Donald Trump won the election but the Russians meddled in the election and, you know, in a variety of ways.
FAGEN: (INAUDIBLE) a problem for Trump.
ROBINSON: What?
FAGEN: Go ahead.
ROBINSON: No. And I -- and I`m not sure how this is playing out.
FAGEN: The bigger problem for Trump, I think, on this issue, you know, isn`t necessarily the back and forth on Julian Assange or this particular hacking issue. It`s when you demoralize an agency which they`re claiming out of leaks that that`s what`s happening, at least I don`t know if that really true or not. But the intelligence community is saying they`re demoralized over this.
But is attacking publicly the intelligence community, and then when we need to use the intelligence community because there`s another issue in the world, we need to use it with a foreign leader. That, to me, is the challenge.
It`s one thing to get into the politics of the Democrats and Republicans in the last election. People aren`t going to remember that, likely, in a month or two. But, boy, six months down the road, when you need your intelligence community and you can`t use it.
TODD: Well, let me -- on that very point, President Obama, today, did an interview today with our affiliate in Chicago, part of this, sort of, farewell tour. And he was asked about this issue of President-elect Trump in the -- in the -- not believing the intel community. Here`s what he said.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Do you have full faith in the conclusions of the intelligence briefing that you got today?
BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Yes. My hope is that when the president-elect receives his own briefings and is able to examine the intelligence, as his team has put together and they see how professional and effective these agencies are, that some of those current tensions will be reduced.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
TODD: I hear that from various Republican senators. I`ve heard that from president that they -- that they are all expressing optimism that once he`s in office, his tune will change.
ROBINSON: Well, look, one of the few things that Donald Trump has been absolutely consistent on is this softer view of Russia. And I think that`s really the big picture issue here, this sort of whiplash on Russia policy.
TODD: Well, and that`s what Tom Cotton is bringing up. It`s, like -- it`s more than just this. It`s Ukraine. It`s, you know, --
ROBINSON: Exactly. And so, the view of a U.S. government, for the last many years, has been that Russia is a problematic actor in -- on the international stage. And more than that is violating international law, by invading Ukraine, and annexing Crimea, and invading Georgia, and destabilizing democracies.
And now, we have a president-elect who says, gee, Vladimir Putin is really smart. We can have a new relationship with Russia. We can cooperate with Russia on all these various fronts. So, where does that lead?
TODD: Well -- and I think when the -- when -- it`s when the Crimea sanctions, that -- when that sort of comes up again, right. When Europe -- when it comes up later this year, that`s going to be the next, I think, big moment in this issue for him, is it not?
GONZALES: I mean, I keep coming back to that. Oval Office -- that initial Oval Office meeting with President Obama and Donald Trump, when Donald Trump looked like the color had drained out of his face. You know, and Obama probably just gave him a taste of what was to come.
And, you know, is a 69-year-old man going to change, you know, the character of who he is? Probably not. But is he going to -- are things slightly going to change on January 20th, January 21st because of new information? But if you can`t trust the people that are hired to do the work --
TODD: Well, I think it`s also the people who interpret the intelligence. And Mike Flynn, the national security advisor, clearly -- some people think he has an ax to grind with the intelligence community, in general, because he didn`t think he got the respect he deserved at DNI. That`s a problem. Is it not, Sara?
FAGEN: I mean, if that`s true, that`s a problem. You`ve got to have an independent analysis coming in and multiple voices coming in --
TODD: Right.
FAGEN: -- on these topics all the time. And that`s what, I think -- you know, the thing about Donald Trump, though, is, you know, he has, historically, been somebody who has many people coming to him. And so, --
TODD: But on intel, right now, it feels like just one.
FAGEN: Yes, but he`s going to learn that as he gets there. And I think to your earlier point, you know, right now, Barack Obama, to some degree, is the -- you know, he`s the principal figure in government and in politics. And that is about to change. And that dynamic will change for Donald Trump and their administration.
TODD: I`m going to pause things here. Thank you very much.
Coming up, I got -- later this weekend, I have Senators McCain and Graham together on ""MEET THE PRESS"" this Sunday. We`ll be talking about Russia.
And tomorrow Senator Amy Klobuchar will join me here on MEET THE PRESS DAILY. All three of the senators, by the way, travelled to Eastern Europe over the holiday break to look at what Russia was doing there.
Still ahead tonight, we are talking to Senator Bernie Sanders about the Democrats` strategy to try to hold the line on Obamacare and more so keep it here.
[17:19:45]
TODD: Coming up, I`ll talk to Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, who`s been extremely critical of Republican efforts to repeal Obamacare and alter Medicare. We`ll have that coming up, right after this.
TODD: Welcome back.
The new year is just five days old and president-elect Donald Trump has used his Twitter account to talk about three different car companies. In the cross-hairs today, Toyota. Trump tweeted Toyota Motor said will build a new plant in Baja, Mexico to build Corolla cars for U.S. No way! Build plant in U.S. or pay big border tax. We should note that Toyota`s new Corolla plant is actually in Wapato (ph) not in Baja, Mexico. Whether the threat was valid or not, Toyota stock was down today.
Trump had favorable things to say about Ford earlier this week and then had harsh words for General Motors. Let`s see, if your KIA, Nissan, BMW, watch out. We`ll be right back.
Still ahead. What`s next for Democrats in the Trump era? Senator Bernie Sanders will be with me after the break. But here is Susan Li with CNBC ""MARKET WRAP"".
SUSAN LI, CORRESPONDENT, CNBC: Thanks, Chuck. Stocks ending mixed, Dow sinking 42 points, the S&P slipping one and the Nasdaq is today`s winner, climbing 10 to a new record.
Employers added 153,000 jobs in the month of December, according to payroll processer ADP. That was below, though, the 170,000 jobs that economists were expecting.
Meantime, the number of Americans filing for first-time jobless claims came in at 235,000, that`s fewer than the 260,000 expected. Both reports precede the government`s closely-watched labor report due on Friday morning.
That`s it from CNBC, first in business worldwide.
[17:24:31]
TODD: Welcome back to MTP DAILY.
Joining me now, it`s the independent senator from Vermont and former Democratic presidential candidate, Senator Bernie Sanders.
Senator Sanders, happy new year. Welcome back, sir.
SANDERS: Thank you very much.
TODD: Let me start with what`s happening here with health care. One of your colleagues, Senator Tom Cotton, we were -- was on the show earlier. And he was -- he put out a warning.
It was very similar to what John Kasich, Governor of Ohio, said earlier today which seemed to be, before repeal, that there has to be a plan -- some plan in place or at least a plan that is digestible for the public before repealing. That there seems to be a growing movement among some Republicans that say, you can`t just repeal before you have your replacement. Do you see that as progress?
SANDERS: I do. I mean, I think it is basically insane that they come up with a plan that throws 20 million Americans off of health insurance, moves towards the privatization of Medicare, raises prescription drug costs for seniors, and does away with patient protection acts like preexisting conditions that are enormously important without any alternative.
What a rational approach would be is to see how we can work together to improve the Affordable Care Act, not simply junk it with no alternative in place.
TODD: What is -- what is the plan of the Democrats to deal with this? Obviously, Republicans have control of the Senate and there is going to be a Republican in the White House. They have made this promise that they`re going to scrap some form of Obamacare, in some form. Whatever they`re going to do here.
For six years, when Republicans talked about repeal, Democrats would say, hey, come up with a plan and then we`ll talk. Do you think that you, and other Democrats, need to come up with an alternative fix to counter whatever the Republicans are going to do here or do you just say -- step back and say, you`re on your own?
SANDERS: Chuck, the United States of America is the only industrialized country on earth not to guarantee health care to all people as a right. We pay the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs because of the greed of the pharmaceutical industry. Everybody recognizes that the Affordable Care Act is far from perfect. What a rational approach is, is you sit people down together and you say, what are the problems? Let`s go forward and rectify it. Let`s make sure that all of our people have healthcare as a right, that we don`t pay the highest prices in the world. Let`s go forward together. But I think Senator Cotton is right. You can`t simply throw something out without having any alternative at all in place.
TODD: I understand that. But do you believe the Democratic Party should come up with an alternative or work with the Republicans on an alternative?
SANDERS: Chuck, they are the ones who are repealing the existing legislation. Their job is to come up with an alternative and our job is to work with them to make sure that it is a good alternative. And by the way, when you talk about a real alternative, you cannot include in that giving tens and tens of billions of dollars in tax breaks to the wealthiest 1 percent.
TODD: This week I have seen more Democrats defend Obamacare in ways that I did not see in the last three years politically. Does that -- do you think if Democrats in general had been more supportive of this and campaigned for it as hard as President Obama did throughout the past three or four years that the law would be more popular with the public today?
SANDERS: Well, you know, despite all of the attacks on the Affordable Care Act, and a lot of these attacks are just not honest attacks. You know, every time that the cost of health care goes up, it is not necessarily the fault of the Affordable Care Act. Despite all of that, the plan remains reasonably popular. I think about 50 percent of the American people still support it.
TODD: It`s about a one to one.
SANDERS: Yes, all right, that`s with all of these attacks, and some of them dishonest attacks. But our job right now is to do what every other major country on earth does. Number one, should we guarantee healthcare to all people as a right? I believe so. Should we continue to be paying such high prices compared to the rest of the world? No, we should not. Now, I think we have to have the guts to take on the private insurance companies and the drug companies who are ripping us off every single day. And I think there are some Republicans who may understand that.
TODD: You know, it`s interesting, when you went on the floor earlier this week, you brought out a Trump tweet where he talked about not wanting to touch Medicare and social security. Are you -- do you believe him? Are you skeptical? It sounded in your speech that you`re both -- you want to believe him but you`re skeptical.
SANDERS: Right. Here`s the story. I think that one of the reasons that Mr. Trump won the election is he appealed to a lot of working-class people, a lot of elderly people. And he said, listen, I am not Paul Ryan. I am not one of your run of the mill Republicans. I`m different, and I`m going to protect working people. And I, Donald Trump, hey, I am not going to cut social security. I`m not going to cut Medicare. I`m not going to cut Medicaid. Well, one of two things, Chuck, is true, either he was basically lying and just telling people something that he knew would get him votes, or he was sincere. If he is sincere, now is the time for him to tell his Republican colleagues, hey, stop the effort to cut Medicare and Medicaid and social security. I will veto any legislation that comes to my desk which has those cuts. I hope he has the integrity to do that.
TODD: What do you make of his shaming of some companies on jobs the way he does on twitter? He`s done it twice this week, Toyota today. General motors earlier this week. What do you make of all that?
SANDERS: I don`t use the word shaming. I think, as president or president-elect, he has the right, and I have done this for years to say to large corporations, many of whom have benefited from their being in the United States of America, you know what, we are tired of your throwing out American workers out on the street. We`re tired of you moving to China and Mexico and hiring people for a fraction of the wages you`re paying the United States. So I think -- I applaud the president-elect for trying to keep jobs in the United States, and I have voted against every one of these disastrous trade policies and I`ll do my best to see the corporations reinvest in America, not in Mexico or China.
TODD: You think it`s a good thing that he`s got some corporate boards a little nervous every morning to see who he is going to tweet against today?
SANDERS: This is what I think, Chuck. You can`t have policy by tweet, company by company. We need new trade policies that says to correspondent America, sorry, you`re going to start investing in this country, and not just in low-wage countries around the world. You need a policy. You can`t do it tweet by tweet. And I hope that Mr. Trump is prepared to work with some of us in developing sensible trade policies.
TODD: Tell me about what you want to see happen on January 15th, the day of resistance. Explain that.
SANDERS: I think it is important that the Democratic Party begins to get itself outside of Capitol Hill and gets back into the communities and the street corners of America. And I think it is terribly important that we begin to work with communities all over this country, working people, the unions, senior citizen groups, physicians groups, and make it clear that the American people will not accept horrific cuts to Medicare, to Medicaid, will not allow seniors to pay more for prescription drugs. So the goal on January 15th is in many communities around this country to bring people together, to say to the Republican leadership, hey, we are going to fight you, you`re not going to simply throw millions of people out of their healthcare insurance.
TODD: I was intrigued when you referred to Democrats and fellow Democrats, any change of heart on you personally registering as a Democrat?
SANDERS: Well, in Vermont you cannot register as anything. You take a ballot on a primary day, and I`ve always taken the Democratic ballot. But I am right now -- I won this seat as an independent. I will continue to stay on as an independent.
TODD: And if you run again, you would run as an independent, not as a Democrat?
SANDERS: Well, we`ll cross that bridge when it comes.
TODD: Oh, that`s not a -- what part of that has not been decided, whether to run again?
SANDERS: It`s not really one of the most important issues facing the American people.
TODD: Fair enough.
SANDERS: Right now we`re trying to make sure that the American people continue to have the health insurance that they need.
TODD: Let me go to the DNC race, another new candidate today, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana. I know you`ve endorsed Keith Ellison, a member of congress. Tom Perez, the outgoing labor secretary also thrown his hat in the ring. Did you endorse too early? What do you think of these other two candidates?
SANDERS: I don`t know the mayor of South Bend. I know Tom Perez and he`s a very decent guy. But what you need right now is a total transformation of the Democratic Party, and I`m trying to do that as part of the Democratic leadership, and I know that`s what Keith Ellison believes. Look, we have lost the White House. We`ve lost the senate. We`ve lost the house. Two-thirds of governor`s chairs are controlled by Republicans. We`ve lost 900 legislative seats in the last 8 years. The status quo is not working. We`ve got to open the doors of the Democratic Party to working people, to young people. We`ve got to get our financial resources from ordinary people, not just from the wealthy and the powerful. So I -- Keith Ellison is the candidate of real change in the Democratic Party, and I strongly support him.
TODD: Are you concerned at all about some of the criticism he`s received from ADL and some Jewish members of the party?
SANDERS: Absolutely not, no.
TODD: Concerned about his previous stance on Israel?
SANDERS: What I am concerned about is the kind of negativity that is being thrown at Keith, unfair and unjust negativity. You know what, you can be critical of Mr. Netanyahu and not be an anti-Semite. And people who try to conflate those are doing something that I think is unacceptable.
TODD: Do you imagine working with a President Trump on anything outside of infrastructure?
SANDERS: I think there are issues. I just mentioned one issue. Trump campaigned very hard, very important part of his campaign was the understanding that millions of people in this country have lost decent paying jobs because of disastrous trade agreements. We need new trade policies. We need to tell corporate America, invest in the United States, not just China, not just Mexico. I would be delighted to work with Mr. Trump on sensible trade policies which create good paying jobs in this country. You raised the issue of infrastructure, huge issue. Our infrastructure is collapsing. We can create millions of decent paying jobs rebuilding our roads, and our bridges, and our water systems. And if Trump comes up with an idea which does not include massive levels of privatization and huge tax breaks for corporations and the wealthy, yes, we can work with him on that as well.
TODD: All right, Senator Bernie Sanders, I`m going to leave it there. Always interesting, sir, to hear from you, appreciate it and appreciate your time.
SANDERS: Thank you very much.
TODD: You got it. Coming up, we`ll bring back the round-table, and you`re going to want to stick around to find out how Donald Trump quietly made history today. Keep it here.
TODD: Welcome back. John Kerry gave his last press briefing as secretary of state today. He highlighted accomplishments of the state department. But every department, including state, should think about how the voters in 2016 publicly expressed their disappointment in government. And when NBC`s Andrea Mitchell asked about Trump`s criticism of the Intel community, Secretary Kerry stood behind the work of U.S. intelligence officers.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
JOHN KERRY, SECRETARY OF STATE: They do not draw political conclusions. I don`t think the president or this building could do the quality of job that we do without the input of the intelligence community. Not all of which we accept every day on face value, believe me, so the combined expertise of all of that community, probed, and re-probed, and re-probed, probed, has come to a common assessment that the government of Russia engaged in a concerted effort to influence and interfere with the integrity of our electoral process.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
TODD: Kerry adds that the Intel community is not infallible, but that they deserve respect in the way leaders question their conclusions. Coming up, what`s old is new again. Why I`m obsessed with a revival of an old rule in congress that is nearly 150 years old.
TODD: Welcome back. Tonight, I am obsessed with something you just may have missed this week. Something one Democrat has called the Armageddon rule. While Republicans were busying themselves on Tuesday night, trying to defang the office of congressional ethics, something they backed away from the next day. Washington Post reports that they reinstate -- they did end up reinstating an old rule called the Holman rule. How old is this rule? It dates back to 1876. That`s right, 1876, during the administration of one Ulysses S. Grant. It allows lawmakers to cut the salary of a federal worker, any federal worker to $1. Even some Republicans are a bit queasy over this one, but house majority leader Kevin McCarthy says it helps hold all federal agencies accountable. OK, will it? Of course, there`s another possibility, you could have, say, a president, let`s call him Donald Trump, who wants to make a point about cutting federal spending. Maybe the president, this one that we`re calling Donald Trump, could, if he chose, make a high-profile announcement that he just got congress to vote to cut the pay of a handful of federal workers to $1, that would, quote, send that message that he`s serious about cutting the deficit even if he doesn`t do anything about cutting the deficit. Meanwhile, a bunch of people might be effectively out of a job. Look, will it happen, we`ll see. A full house and senate still have to pass this, but it`s another example of how we`re in a brand new era, or a very old one. We`ll be right back.
TODD: Back in the lid, panel is back, Sara Fagen, Eugene Robinson, and Nathan Gonzales. All right, Sara Fagen, you heard Tom Cotton say, look, you can`t repeal unless there is something concrete there. And he said it can phase in, but you have to know what the plan is going to look like before you repeal. John Kasich is essentially saying the same thing. Not with what Mitch McConnell seemed to say. So where is this headed?
SARA FAGEN, CNBC CONTRIBUTOR: Well, you know, I think the smart politics on this would be to have a plan in place.
TODD: Duh. I know, but?
FAGEN: But people who elected Donald Trump are clamoring for this to be repealed. It`s a big part of the reason in mid-terms that Republicans also did well. I mean, there was so doubt, Bernie Sanders is right. There is a large chunk of the country that supports this, but there`s a large chunk of the country that think that this has been disastrous policy and hurt a lot of people`s pocketbooks based on the way this has been implemented. So, you know, the smart thing to do is to repeal it and have a plan in place, but repealing it and then ultimately doing a good plan down the road, I don`t think necessarily we should assume that`s terrible politician, Republicans either.
TODD: Really? Nathan? I think it`s risky.
NATHAN GONZALES, THE ROTHENBERG & GONZALES POLITICAL REPORT EDITOR AND PUBLISHER: The expectation from the Republican grassroots is to get this repeal. I mean -- two years ago, Republicans who thought, even with a Democratic president he was going to be get repeal. So now they have to do something. The question is what? I mean, you have Rand Paul and a group of Republicans who are -- who were saying, OK, repeal it, replace it, but not at the expense of the budget and increasing the deficit, so the Republican Party -- just because there all in power, doesn`t mean there`s a clear way forward.
EUGENE ROBINSON, WASHINGTON POST COLUMNIST: This proposing idea can`t necessarily be reconciled within the Republican caucus, right, how to replace it. And basically, if you`re going to replace it and you`re not going to kick a bunch of people, like millions of people, off of their insurance, you`re going to have to spend money. And if you`re not going to have an individual mandate, which you can`t because that`s the most unpopular part of Obamacare, then you have to spend a bunch of money to do anything. And I`m not convinced that the Republican caucus in the house and in the senate can agree to do that now, or a year from now, or three years from now. I`m not convinced.
FAGEN: Here is the -- you know, Mitch McConnell is a good chess player. And he knows that -- you know, what Eugene said is right. You`re right. Like, this is complicating. There`s not a one pager on how you will replace this. And so -- but Republicans who have been elected have a credibility problem if they don`t repeal this with their base, if they don`t do it soon. And so.
TODD: If they do it in a rush, and they do it sloppily, and that`s a problem.
FAGEN: But that`s the argument for repealing it. And then, you know, giving you very long lead way, so you have time to put something in place. You know -- then you get into the politics of kicking it down the road constantly and that long.
(CROSSTALK)
TODD: I smell dock --
(CROSSTALK)
ROBINSON: Exactly, Exactly.
TODD: Repeal Obamacare and then two years extended, another two years.
ROBINSON: Exactly.
GONZALES: I think -- I believe the Trump team has said it`s giving congress a February deadline to say we want something on the president`s desk, I think mid-February. That might seem crazy, but I think one of the mistakes that President Obama made in 2009, was just handing it off to congress, letting them play with NCA for a year and a half, then he didn`t even tried to sell it before the 22 midterms and all these Democrats who just hung out to dry.
TODD: There have been more Democrats supporting Obamacare this week than the entire last four years. I mean, it`s a joke. I mean -- look, at the time, yes. The implementation was a mess, the roll-out was a mess, and Democrats -- good grief.
FAGEN: The smart middle ground maybe to repeal it and past principles about how we`re going to fix it, and then go -- take the time to do it right. Which -- you`re right, it was not done, you know, the first go around in the proper way, which is why we`re in the mess that we`re in today.
ROBINSON: Well, they took a lot of time the first time, you know.
TODD: Too much time.
ROBINSON: Exactly. So, the other way to do it, I think is for President Trump, when he becomes president to write it, to say we`re going to do it this way. Do it this way. That`s what President Obama didn`t do. He said you couldn`t get it done that way. You`ve got to let congress work it out. This what congress worked out. And so the other way it seems to me is -- say, this is the way it`s going to be.
GONZALES: And then he has to sell it on the campaign trail to avoid a midterm collapse for the Republican Party.
TODD: The thing that was intriguing to me was something Senator Sanders said when I asked about this which is they`re not -- he doesn`t think Democrats should come up with an alternative, but once the Republicans have a plan, Democrats -- they seemed to open the door for, OK, you know, if you listen to some of my ideas, I`ll work with you. Will McConnell and that crowd take him up on it?
FAGEN: Well, I think it depends on where the debate ends up, in terms of where the debate is, and what people are proposing. But, you know, certainly, if Democrats are playing long ball here, this is going to be an issue in the midterm. And they`re going to have something that they`re for. They can`t just be for Obamacare, which is -- assuming it`s been repealed, it will be perceived that has been failed.
GONZALES: Jessie Fergusson -- campaign aide, veteran of the Clinton campaign, had an op-ed just a couple of days ago about Democrats finding a balance between opposing the president and obstructing the president. Now exactly where is that line in which side, but I think this heath -- ACA is a good example of that.
TODD: What I can`t figure out, Sanders rhetoric is seems to lean more -- OK, we`ve got to work with him while we can. Schumer`s rhetoric lately has been, no, which you would expect the other way around.
ROBINSON: Well -- yes, I mean, I think a lot of us is the other at this point.
(CROSSTALK)
ROBINSON: I thought that was theatrical
TODD: But I don`t get Trump attacking him today on twitter, calling him a clown. That`s not a way to get bipartisan support.
FAGEN: I don`t get that either. He needs Schumer on issues, and you`ve got to figure out a balancing end. I mean, the question is -- the press maybe doesn`t take all of these tweets that seriously. But, boy, when you`re on the other end and you`re an individual, that`s very personal.
TODD: That`s true, excellent point. All right, guys, thank you, very much. We`ve got a pack show and we have more coming up, something Donald Trump has been keeping uncharacteristically quiet about. Stay with us.
TODD: In case you missed it, it appears Donald Trump made history today becoming the very first president-elect to be deposed. The president-elect says (INAUDIBLE) sworn video tape deposition of Trump Tower today, stemming from a lawsuit Trump filed after Chef Jose Andreas back out of plans to open a restaurant at Trump`s new hotel here in Washington. A few presidents, actually, have been deposed once in office. The first president to be deposed was President Grant, two Grant mentioned today, by the way, back in 1870, over a bribery scandal known as the whiskey ring. A hundred years later, President Ford gave a video tape deposition in the trial of Lynette, Squeaky, Fromme, who of course was accused of trying to assassinate Ford. President Jimmy Carter was deposed multiple times during his presidency on several cases including over his family`s peanut warehouse. The most recent president to be deposed, of course, was President Bill Clinton, he gave sworn testimony as president multiple times, most memorably, of course, on the Paula Jones sexual harassment suit, when he denied having a sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky. It`s fair to expect that Trump -- has other multiple other pending legal issues will also be deposed once he`s in the White House as well, so he would join that exclusive club. But he is now the first president-elect to be deposed. That`s all for tonight, we`ll be back tomorrow for more MTP Daily.
THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED."

SEAN HANNITY, HOST (voice-over): Tonight, President Obama visits Capitol Hill to try and save his disastrous health care law. And Democrats resort to scare tactics -- what a shock -- over repealing and replacing it.
SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY), MINORITY LEADER: The Republican plan to cut health care wouldn't make America great again, it would make America sick again.
HANNITY: Plus, part two of our exclusive interview with WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.
JULIAN ASSANGE, WIKILEAKS: Donald Trump early on in his administration needs to set a standard. 
HANNITY: Also, Newt Gingrich is here to react to all of this.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Obstruct.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Obstruct.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Obstruct.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Defeat.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Anything.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Anything.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Anything.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Anything that violates our core values as diverse Americans.
HANNITY: Then Hollywood liberals are urging Congress to obstruct President-elect Donald Trump! We'll talk about the snowflakes with Corey Lewandowski.
And violence in cities like Chicago surging. Ainsley Earhardt has a full report. Also, we'll check in with Sheriff David Clarke.
""Hannity"" starts right here, right now.
(END VIDEOTAPE)
HANNITY: And welcome to ""Hannity."" So we're getting incredible reaction to our exclusive interview with WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange. Now, we're going to play more of our sitdown interview. That's coming up later tonight.
But first, a very desperate President Obama goes to Capitol Hill all in a last-ditch effort to try and save his disastrous health care law. And that is tonight's ""Opening Monologue.""
All right, so ""Obama care"" has been a monumental failure, but that is not stopping the president and Democrats from trying to save it. Now, after huddling on Capitol Hill earlier today, well, left-wing congressional leaders -- they dusted off the same old, tired, divisive rhetoric. They want to scare you, the American people, about those wascally (sic) Republicans repealing and replacing ""Obama care,"" the same old talking points. Take a look.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY), MINORITY LEADER: The Republican plan to cut health care wouldn't make America great again, it would make America sick again.
REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA), MINORITY LEADER: They have no replacement plan. They have no replacement plan because they just -- they can't -- they can't agree. They don't have the votes. So to repeal and then delay is an act of cowardice. That means, We don't really know what we're doing.
SCHUMER: And they want to repeal it and then try to hang it on us. Not going to happen. It's their responsibility, plain and simple. Now they're going to own it and all the problems in the health care system -- and there have been many throughout the years, no one has solved all of them -- are going to be on their back.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
HANNITY: Oh, really, Democrats? They now want to claim that Republicans - - they're to blame for breaking ""Obama care""? Well, that's just a big, flat-out lie! And you know what? They know that because ""Obama care"" is already broken and it's failing you, the American people, miserably.
Now, we're going to show you the numbers that prove all of this in just a minute. But at the same time, President Obama -- he ran to Capitol Hill. Now, Vice President-elect Mike Pence -- he was meeting with Republicans at that time to formulate the plan to repeal and replace this disastrous law. Now, here's what he said right after. Take a look.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
GOV. MIKE PENCE (R-IN), VICE PRES.-ELECT: The first order of business is to repeal and replace ""Obama care."" ""Obama care"" has failed. And the American people have sent a decisive message to Washington, D.C., that they want ""Obama care"" to be repealed and replaced with health care reform that will lower the cost of health insurance without growing the size of government.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
HANNITY: All right, now, Republicans -- they need to make sure, one, they keep their promises and also move very quickly to repeal and replace ""Obama care,"" which, by the way, they appear to be on track to do.
But they also need to be careful because Democrats have already shown -- well, they're are not going to be blaming themselves when ""Obama care"" finally dies and crumbles. Now, President-elect Trump -- he issued this warning to the GOP and his colleagues earlier today. He tweeted out in part, quote, ""Republicans must be careful in that the Dems own the failed `Obama care' disaster with its poor coverage and massive premium increases, like the 116 percent hike in Arizona Also, deductibles are so high that it is practically useless. Don't let the Schumer clowns out of this web.""
Now, the president-elect is 100 percent right. Republicans need to make President Obama and the Democrats own every lie they told, every failed promise they didn't keep, and remember all the times the president -- remember this? Remember all the times he said this.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: No matter how we reform health care, we will keep this promise to the American people. If you like your doctor, you will be able to keep your doctor, period. If you like your health care plan, you will be able to keep your health care plan, period.
If you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor. If you like your health care plan, you can keep your health care plan.
There's no doubt that we must preserve what's best about our health care system, and that means allowing Americans who like their doctors and their health care plans to keep them.
If you've got health insurance, you like your doctor, you like your plan, you can keep your doctor. You can keep your plan. Nobody is talking about taking that away from you.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
HANNITY: Oh, really? Now, he also said the average family would save, on average, $2,500 per family per year. Well, since 2009, the average family is paying $4,100 more. Now, we also know that what the president said about keeping your doctor and plan, that they were lies because millions of Americans lost their doctors, millions lost their plans. And that is just the start of this ""Obama care"" disaster.
Now, here's what the president and Democrats own themselves. Now, remember, this is their plan. This is their fault because not a single Republican voted for this law. Now, ""Obama care"" premiums this year along are increasing by 25 percent on average. And in Arizona, like we mentioned -- well, they'll rise by this year along 116 percent! Now, premiums on average for a family of four making $60,000 a year -- well, that's going to spike by 43.6 percent. Deductibles for the same group are exploding by 22.9 percent.
But the misery for you, the American people -- it doesn't end there. Now, the president promised free market competition and choices for Americans on the exchanges. Sadly, the opposite has happened. Major insurers like Humana, Aetna, United, Blue Cross, Blue Shield -- they're all pulling out of states because they are losing money on the exchanges. Humana alone -- they said they lost over $1 billion just for participating in ""Obama care."" In states like Alabama, Alaska, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Wyoming, people buying on the exchanges -- they only have one single insurer to choose from now.
On top of that, the numbers of health care insurance providers to choose from on Healthcare.gov -- well, that's going to drop just 28 percent this year alone! And then there's all the taxes. The congressional Joint Committee on Taxation has previously found that the middle class will face $377 billion in tax increases, courtesy of ""Obama care.""
And according to a recent study, the surging ""Obama care"" premiums will cost you, the American taxpayer, an extra $9.8 billion this year alone.
So the negative impact of ""Obama care"" is obvious. You, the American people, have felt it directly, which is, in part, one of the reasons why so many voted for President-elect Trump. Now, yes, there are certain aspects of the law that Republicans will keep, like the issue of pre-existing conditions. But ""Obama care"" itself is a single, fundamental, massive big government failure that needs to be completely scrapped and redone so we can offer better care, more free market competition, and of course, lower costs for you, the American consumer.
And tonight, there are just 16 days until the Obama nightmare ends. Now, we're going to show you on the side of our screen tonight statistics -- how bad things have been under this president in the past eight years, the facts the mainstream media will never give you.
Joining is now with reaction, the author of the best-selling book ""Treason."" He's the former speaker of the House, FOX News contributor Newt Gingrich.
You know, here's a pretty funny thing. So the president-elect (sic) goes to the Capitol Hill today, meets with Democrats in the House and Senate, and then he says, Don't help the Republicans repeal or replace ""Obama care,"" and then he suggests that they start referring to the GOP plan as ""Trump care.""
So what part of these statistics does the president not want to face? Because it doesn't look good any which way you measure the actual impact of this law.
NEWT GINGRICH (R), FMR. HOUSE SPEAKER, FOX CONTRIBUTOR: Well, I mean, look, you've watched Barack Obama now for nine years. He doesn't want to face anything. He's going to go to Chicago to give his farewell address without noticing the almost 4,000 people shot in his home town in the last year alone. He doesn't understand anything about foreign policy, and he's in total denial about his health plan.
And remember, one of the majors reasons this economy is moving so slowly is the enormous burden that ""Obama care"" has put on the economy, on small business, on start-ups, on entrepreneurs. The result is -- you know, I'm happy to take his suggestion, by the way. Let's compare ""Trump care"" with ""Obama care."" Let's see a year from now whether or not President Trump and the Republicans can't do a whole series of things that improve access, lower costs, are more honest with the American people, give them greater choices, get the Washington bureaucracy out of the way.
And I think that people like Dr. Tom Price are very committed to having a ""Trump care"" that's a heck of a lot better than ""Obama care."" So let's take him up on his challenged, and we'll see a year from now how many Democrats want to run for reelection...
HANNITY: Oh, free market competition...
GINGRICH: ... in 2018 defending the old order.
HANNITY: Free market competition, portability...
GINGRICH: Absolutely.
HANNITY: ... taking your health care from job to job, buying across state lines. That competition is only going to lower costs, increase the services that people will get. That is economics 101.
GINGRICH: Well...
HANNITY: Here -- here's what I want to ask you. So if Donald Trump, because the president did not respect separation of powers, coequal branches of government -- if the first three or four hours of the Trump administration is to sign away and rescind all these executive orders, and the next thing is Donald Trump signs into law to repeal law of ""Obama care,"" the only thing that I see left that the Obama's legacy is about would be refugees he's let into the country, some of whom may commit crimes in the future, the judges he appointed and the $10 trillion in debt.
It will almost be -- and tell me if I'm wrong...
GINGRICH: Well...
HANNITY: It will almost be as if he didn't exist for the last eight years!
GINGRICH: No, and he'll get a nice portrait in the White House. All presidents get nice portraits.
(LAUGHTER)
GINGRICH: So...
HANNITY: But isn't it profound?
GINGRICH: ... he'll have a nice portrait -- oh, look, I've told people this is like one of those dolls that you watch the air come out of it and it shrinks and shrinks. By the time you get to Easter, the ""Obama care,"" the Obama legacy is going to be so small, you're going to need a microscope to find it.
I think that no president in my lifetime, maybe no president in modern history, will have had as small an impact as Barack Obama because he lied to the American people over and over again. He failed to work with the Congress. He tried to do everything by executive order, and executive orders last exactly as long as the president.
So he's going to be very sobered by summer watching virtually everything he thought he accomplished go away.
HANNITY: So (INAUDIBLE) I'm putting up the economic statistics on the side of the screen so our audience can see it for themselves tonight. But then you look on foreign policy, there's no Russian reset. Things are worse than ever. Our relations with Israel are worse than ever. I don't think anybody would argue the Iranian deal is any good or Iraq is better off or Afghanistan is better off or our relationship with North Korea or China is better off.
What foreign policy success does he (INAUDIBLE)
GINGRICH: No, look, I think...
HANNITY: Benghazi?
GINGRICH: Well, Cuba.
HANNITY: OK. Is that a success really?
GINGRICH: He's much -- he's much closer -- he's much closer to the Castro dictatorship than any American president has ever been. So I guess he could cite Cuba is his great success, not that it did anything for the Cuba people, but it made Obama feel good.
HANNITY: You know, Mike...
GINGRICH: Well, but -- but here's...
HANNITY: Go ahead.
GINGRICH: You know, the challenge you and I have and the challenge our audience has is that the elite media is so totally in the tank for left- wing ideas and left-wing values that they can't report accurately any of this.
And so they keep taking the word of various people -- you know, the economy's very weak. The jobs that have created, frankly, are undervalued jobs that in many cases are part-time. The fact is that people who want to get into the middle class have a harder time now. Obama has pushed -- according to the Gallup studies, he's pushed 25 million people out of the middle class in his eight years. Now, that's an extraordinary negative achievement.
HANNITY: Let me ask you this last question. Everything that Donald Trump has run on -- Mike Pence said today to the Republican conference that it's time to be the party that now keeps their promises. I don't care if it's vetting refugees, building a wall, education back to the states, lowering the corporate tax to 15 percent, repealing and replacing ""Obama care"" -- all of these are really big ideas, and you've got resistance now and fear mongering that is only just beginning.
So you've been through this once before. What do you advise Donald Trump to do to navigate through the propaganda, the name calling, the fear mongering that predictably is going to emerge?
GINGRICH: Well, actually, I've been through it twice, once with Reagan...
HANNITY: That's true.
GINGRICH: ... and once as Speaker of the House in the '90s. I would say that the number one challenge to the team led by President-elect Trump going to be remembering what matters, focusing on the important, not the urgent, and making every morning, you get up and you say, Look, this is what we were elected to do. We're going to keep focusing on it and understanding if Chuck Schumer wants to be Senator No, that's his prerogative. That will shrink the Democratic Party. It'll set up a referendum...
HANNITY: Well, he says there's no...
GINGRICH: ... in 2018...
HANNITY: He says Donald Trump won't get any Supreme Court justice passed while he's the Senate minority leader.
HANNITY: Well, of course, he can't stop that because I think, you know, they're going to find out pretty rapidly that the Republicans are not going to tolerate the Democrats exploiting in a disciplined way the right to filibuster. I think he (INAUDIBLE) he could complete the disaster that Harry Reid started, if he really does play that kind of a hard-nosed game.
Mitch McConnell is a very smart tactician, and McConnell has a real obligation to get the cabinet approved and to get the Supreme Court nominee approved. My prediction is he will win. And let's -- look, if you're one of the 10 senators from states that Donald Trump carried...
HANNITY: Missouri, Manchin...
GINGRICH: ... do you really want to go home having blocked everything?
HANNITY: I don't think it would be good for Claire McCaskill or Joe Manchin in they did that. They're both up in two years.
All right, stay right there. More with Newt Gingrich right after the break.
And also coming up tonight right here...

(NEWSBREAK)
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
ASSANGE: We published that the -- several Podesta e-mails which shows Podesta responding to a phishing e-mail. Now, how did they respond? Podesta gave out that his password was the word password. His own staff said, This e-mail that you've received -- this is totally legitimate. So - - so this is something a 14-year-old kid -- a 14-year-old kid could have hacked.
HANNITY: Based on...
(CROSSTALK)
ASSANGE: ... that way.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
HANNITY: Sad we don't have cyber security. Now, that was Julian Assange talking about the lack of security that plagued the Clinton campaign. Now, following my one-on-one exclusive interview with the WikiLeaks founder, President-elect Trump -- he tweeted out, quote, ""Julian Assange said a 14- year-old could have hacked Podesta. So why was the DNC so careless? He also said Russians did not give him the information.""
We continue with former speaker of the House Newt Gingrich, a FOX News contributor. You told me you watched the interview. I wish I had the time to air more. We have at least 40 minutes more. We'll air some of that tonight.
What were your general thoughts? Because when we asked the audience after the show what they thought, whether they believed Assange or Obama and Hillary, the majority, vast, overwhelming majority believed Assange. What are your thoughts?
GINGRICH: Well, let me say, first of all, I think what you did is so fascinating, and Assange is such a down-to-earth, straightforward interviewee. You begin to realize we don't have cybersecurity for much of what we're doing. We're way behind the curve in what we have to learn how to do if we're going to function as a society. And I think in that sense, this is very revealing interview.
Second, the idea that a 14-year-old could have done it, but it was the Russians, tells you how desperate Obama and the Democrats are to find some excuse to discredit Donald J. Trump because they can't stand the idea that he won because Hillary was so bad, because the Obama record was so bad, and because the American people were tired of radical policies that don't work. So they've -- in some ways, they've trumped this whole thing up...
HANNITY: You know...
GINGRICH: ... to use a phrase, in order to try to discredit the president- elect.
HANNITY: And that's the amazing thing here. Now, whether you like Julian Assange or not, he's really committed his life to this work, answered unequivocally he's never spoken to Putin, he's never spoken to his surrogates, never spoken to Trump or his surrogates.
And when I asked him -- I said, Well, what if the information was about Donald Trump, would you have released it? And his answer was absolutely, positively yes.
Now, when you look at what they exposed about the DNC and you look at what we learned about the collusion with the news media and the Clinton campaign, I've got to believe that this is more trustworthy information than anything we're getting from The New York Times or Politico or NBC or CBS or ABC. Is that a stretch to say something...
GINGRICH: No, no. Look, I think this -- one of the great sad things about the last eight years is the degree to which the Obama administration has corrupted the intelligence community and has led the to people just not believing the director of national intelligence, not believing the head of the CIA.
And similarly, when the elite media decided they were in the tank for Hillary Clinton, that they were going to go all out on a one-sided effort, they actually broke the country's faith that they had anything to do with the news. They became propaganda instruments, not news instruments.
And the result is people are more likely to believe watching an interview for 40 minutes than they are to believe, you know, the so-called wise men of The New York Times. And that's a real drop in institutional confidence in this country.
And in the long run, it's dangerous for the country to have people who can't trust their government, can't trust their news media. It's one of those things that President Trump is going to have to correct is -- and this is part of why I think his tweeting is important. You're getting an authentic Trump. Whether he's right or wrong sometimes, whether there's occasionally things he shouldn't say, the act of being that direct, that open, of having people see who he authentically is I think helps rebuild faith in the system.
HANNITY: I think the collusion between the media and the Clinton campaign was so over-the-top egregious, I don't think that trust will ever be rebuilt. But by the way, Chuck Todd over at NBC thinks they did a great job. He was putting himself on the back.
Mr. Speaker, good to see you. Happy new year. And it's going to be a fascinating...
GINGRICH: Good to see you.

HANNITY: All right, here now with reaction, the vice chair of Donald Trump's presidential inaugural committee and Trump transition team executive committee member Anthony Scaramucci, and former Trump campaign manager and Avenue Strategies partner Corey Lewandowski. You're going to be right down the block from the White House.
COREY LEWANDOWSKI, FORMER TRUMP CAMPAIGN MANAGER: Hope so.
HANNITY: And -- but you -- I think this is important for people to know. You always maintained a relationship with Donald Trump, whether you were in the campaign, out of the campaign.
LEWANDOWSKI: Sure.
HANNITY: And you have a friendship with him.
LEWANDOWSKI: Look, it'll be two years ago tomorrow when I started working for Donald Trump when we started planning out this presidential campaign. And in the 18 months I spent working for Donald Trump, you developed a rapport with somebody because we were spending 18 hours a day together.
HANNITY: Oh, by the way, it was you, Hope, and him. And that's what I remember.
LEWANDOWSKI: And an airplane. And an airplane.
HANNITY: And an airplane.
(LAUGHTER)
LEWANDOWSKI: ... flying around, having a lot of fun. And it's gotten so big -- and look, here's what I said. I'm not going into the administration, even though I had some opportunities to do that. I want to help the president achieve his agenda by being on the outside. That means bringing people together, putting pressure on Congress, make sure his Supreme Court picks, hopefully, multiple of those, get done...
ANTHONY SCARAMUCCI, TRUMP INAUGURATION COMMITTEE: Making sure his cabinet secretaries go through without any problems, making sure we provide middle class tax relief, which is what his agenda is, repealing and replacing ""Obama care""...
HANNITY: Mike Pence said it well today, keep the promises.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: That's right.
HANNITY: Keep the promises -- if they do that, they'll walk into reelection, and the country will be better off.
SCARAMUCCI: He's not giving himself enough credit, though. He was the kindling wood at a very early stage in...
HANNITY: I saw it. I was there. I -- I...
SCARAMUCCI: ... concrete and rebar...
HANNITY: Agreed.
SCARAMUCCI: ... when nobody believed anything. And coming out of Iowa, he was the New Hampshire the campaign organization.
HANNITY: Look, it's unfair the way media portrays any of us in this day and age because they hate anybody that's a conservative.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes.
HANNITY: By the way, I want to point out, panned the camera on Mr. Scaramucci here. This guy is in charge of all the inauguration. He is the guy in charge. Everybody needs to suck up to you.
(CROSSTALK)
SCARAMUCCI: He's just super happy. Then he says OK, no problem. He didn't realize the bill I'm sending him.
HANNITY: Are you going to go in?
SCARAMUCCI: Listen, I have said this repeatedly. I love the president. He has been awesome to me and my family, and if the right job materializes for me, Sean, I am an American patriot like you, and I certainly would certainly consider doing it.
HANNITY: No administration would ever consider having me because 30 years of radio and 21 years on FOX.
SCARAMUCCI: But trust me, we need you on the outside. But what I would say to you is if the opportunity presents itself, I will be there. Here's the good news, we've got great people on the inside. We've got great people on the outside, and we are super committed to executing the Donald J. Trump, the president Donald J. Trump --
HANNITY: I hope they who have shown a lack of backbone and a spine over the years -- I'm serious. You have a Republican establishment that did not support him. Let's be blunt here. Paul Ryan did not do what he should have done for the nominee of the party. Then you've got a Democratic establishment, then you've got a media establishment that wants to go to war with him.
Now we are talking about these little snowflakes and these Hollywood liberals, it's going to be, I believe, a day by day chipping away at Donald Trump's credibility to hurt him and destroy his agenda.
SCARAMUCCI: I agree with some of that, but he's just going to be constantly underestimated by these people, and he's going to cross those people. But I love the Hollywood liberals. Can I tell you why?
HANNITY: You like their Learjets?
SCARAMUCCI: I love the whole think with the global warming and they fly in on their plane and they say this stupid stuff about themselves and never go anywhere. But what I love about it is the liberal elites in the Democratic Party's love them. They love very little else. They don't love the blue collar workers anymore. They don't love the people that brought them the presidencies of year ago. They love the Hollywood liberal elites and they love the doctrine of political correctness.
HANNITY: It's interesting you say that.
SCARAMUCCI: We stole away the country so we can continue to focus there so we can control the House, the Senate, the presidency, and all the state legislatures.
HANNITY: Corey, you don't remember this, but at one point I said to you very early on, I'm giving out these statistics on radio and TV every day, 95 million Americans out of the labor force, 50 million in poverty and food stamps, 13 million more on food stamps, and the reason was because this election to me was about the forgotten men and women that were out of work, in poverty, on food stamps, the lowest home ownership rate in 51 years. The American dream is ripped out of their guts. That is what this election I think became about.
LEWANDOWSKI: Sean, don't forget that what you have done on talk radio and Rush Limbaugh and others has been so important to the rise of the Donald Trumps of the world, because those talk radio stations across the country - -
HANNITY: I'm on 560.
LEWANDOWSKI: -- are giving everyday people the opportunity to hear the other side of the aisle, right, the other side because the Democrats have control of the mainstream media. So if you're not in your car and you not working, you're not listening to that talk radio, that's what has given the rise to Donald Trump.
HANNITY: In fairness, I never -- the criticism would always come in. Well, you are interviewing this candidate or that candidate. But what I would do is I would ask them what is your plan for health care? What kind of person do you want on the Supreme Court? How are you going to handle immigration? Of all of candidates, Trump was the most specific. He never got credit for it.
LEWANDOWSKI: He didn't get credit for it because, look, the mainstream media always wanted to -- again, to what Anthony said, never take them seriously. On the day he announced he was running for president, the media didn't know what the announcement was about. They showed up in anticipation of him not knowing what you're going to say. And that is a summary of this campaign. They never knew what to do with Donald Trump.
SCARAMUCCI: That's on them for the first 100 days and beyond because he'll continue to do that.
HANNITY: Good to see you both. Thank you. By the way, I am working at the inauguration so I won't be begging for tickets. It's a Friday night. I'll be there. And I'm not wearing one of those goofy suits that every else wears.
SCARAMUCCI: Happy birthday, Sean.
HANNITY: Listen, you're both good friends. Good to see you.
Coming up, violence in Chicago and around the country spiraling out of control. Get this, in Chicago alone, 762 people killed in the last year in the windy city, over 4,000 shot. The president-elect Donald Trump said if Mayor Rahm ""Rahm-bo,"" ""Dead fish"" Emanuel can't get things under control he could ask for federal help. Ainsley Earhardt has a full report, Sheriff David Clarke weighs in, and much more. And also later tonight.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
HANNITY: What would your advice to the incoming president and president- elect Donald Trump be?
JULIAN ASSANGE, FOUNDER, WIKILEAKS: I think it is to learn from that, to learn about the mistakes that were committed by Hillary Clinton, learn from the mistakes of Barack Obama, especially in this area of transparency.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
HANNITY: We will have more of my exclusive interview with Julian Assange straight ahead tonight on HANNITY.
HANNITY: Welcome back to HANNITY. So in 2009 Barack Obama, he entered office under the mantle of hope and change. Now after nearly eight years some of America's major cities are now experiencing a devastating rise in violent crime. Joining me now with the details, ""FOX AND FRIENDS"" co-host, our friend Ainsley Earhardt. Happy New Year, good to see her.
AINSLEY EARHARDT, FOX NEWS HOST: Happy New Year to you too, Sean, thank you.
Listen to these numbers, the statistics are pretty staggering. In recent years, America have seen a tragic uptick in violent crime. The latest nationwide data shows in 2015 homicides across United States rose by more than 10 percent from the year before. And one of the cities which is experiencing significant violence is the president's hometown of Chicago.
And during this past holiday weekend alone, according to ""The Chicago Tribune,"" 55 people were shot during the holiday weekend. According to the Chicago police department, the city reported a devastating 762 homicides last year in 2016. That is two murders a day. It is an unbelievable statistic, 57 percent increase over 2015. In fact, over the past eight years, the windy city has reported 3,919 confirmed homicides.
On Monday, the president-elect Donald Trump reacted to the heartbreaking numbers out of Chicago by tweeting this, ""Chicago murder rate is record setting, 4,331 shooting victim with 762 murders in 2016. If mayor can't do it, he must ask for federal help.""
As the president-elect prepares to take office, violent crime especially in our inner cities will be a serious challenge that the incoming administration will have to face on day one, Sean.
HANNITY: Those are chilling, chilling numbers. That's scary. Ainsley, thank you, stay with us.
Joining us now also with reaction, Milwaukee County Sheriff David Clarke. Sheriff, former police chief of Chicago, one of the top officers there, actually said that 80 percent of the people being killed and shot are black Americans. We've heard a lot about Black Lives Matter, but the Democratic Party, the president, a Democratic mayor, Democratic president, his own hometown, how do you allow 4,000 murders and 10,000 people shot in eight years and not do anything about it?
SHERIFF DAVID CLARKE, MILWAUKEE COUNTY: You just look the other way. There's no sense of urgency on the part of Rahm Emanuel. Gary McCarthy, the former superintendent, should never have signed consent decree that he did. We are not hearing anything from the governor, Rauner, of the state Illinois. Also the attorney general, the state attorney general needs to get involved.
And of course, the resources of the United States Department of Justice, Loretta Lynch has been absent. And Barack Obama has been missing in action. Only in the American ghetto, Sean, could this kind of carnage go on with no sort of emergency measures put in place. If 762 people died in an earthquake or 762 people died in spring flooding in the Midwest, or if 762 people died in a hurricane in the southeast, there's no way that everybody would stand by twiddling their thumbs. That's the problem here, no sense of urgency.
But here's the bottom line. Here is what is wrong in Chicago. It's not the Chicago police department. It's the fact that Mayor Emanuel has allowed Black Lives Matter and the ACLU, the American Civil Liberties Union, to run the Chicago police department. They are setting policy, procedure, and standard operating procedure.
HANNITY: Should they not follow the New York experience? When Mayor Giuliani started stop and frisk, it was over 2,000 murders a year. they got the number down to about 300 or 400, a dramatic decrease, and a majority of those lives saved were black lives. So why not implement a program like that? Would the federal government be able to come in and do that?
CLARKE: They can do it at the city level. But the thing is, I think the promising thing about this, if there is any, is that they don't have to reinvent the wheel here. They don't have to come up with something that's never been tried before. All they have to do is the broken windows, the order maintenance type policing, but you can't do that when Black Lives Matter and the ACLU has set standard operating procedures that don't let police officers on the street do it.
Now, I saw the investigative stop procedure from the Chicago police department. Sean, it's unbelievable what officers have to do after every stop, either a traffic stop or a field interview stop. There's some form that they have to fill out after each and every stop. It discourages police officers.
HANNITY: You're going to spend most of your time at a desk rather than on the street.
CLARKE: Exactly.
HANNITY: Ainsley, let me go back you. So in the time Obama has been president nearly 4,000 people in Chicago killed.
EARHARDT: It is unbelievable. More people died in Chicago in 2016 than in L.A. and New York combined. When I moved to New York it was so danger, my parents were so worried. Chicago is the city now that is so dangerous. They have some of the strictest gun laws. They don't allow assault weapons, and a lot of people say we need strict gun laws. These activists say we need strict gun laws. But there is no correlation there. Strict gun laws does not mean that murders are down. Look at Chicago. Strict gun laws, but murders are up.
HANNITY: I love the fact that Trump said if you can't do the job, we will do it. And you know what, maybe that's a message, because all lives do matter. Anyway, great reporting. Thank you, and we'll see you tomorrow. By the way, congratulations, your book is again number one, number one bestselling book in the country.
Sheriff, your book is coming out because I wrote the forward.
EARHARDT: Really, you have a book coming out?
HANNITY: Right, Sheriff? When is your book coming out?
CLARKE: March release date, ""Cop under Fire, Beyond the Hashtags of Race, Crime, and Politics for a Better America."" You can preorder it on Amazon or Barnes and Noble.
EARHARDT: That's awesome.
HANNITY: You're a hero. Thank you, Sheriff.
EARHARDT: It's going to be number one because our viewers are the best and they support you and love you.
HANNITY: All right, guys, good to see you both. Coming up next tonight right here on HANNITY.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
HANNITY: What would your advice to the incoming president and president- elect Donald Trump be?
ASSANGE: I think it is to learn from that, to learn about the mistakes that were committed by Hillary Clinton, learn from the mistakes of Barack Obama, especially in this area of transparency.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
HANNITY: When we come back, more of my exclusive interview with the WikiLeaks founder, Julian Assange. That's right after this break and much more straight ahead.
HANNITY: And welcome back to HANNITY.
So during my exclusive sit-down interview with WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange in London earlier this week, I asked him what advice would he give President Obama, Hillary Clinton, and president-elect Trump? Here's what he had to say.
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
HANNITY: What's your message at the end of this election and this process and hearing Hillary blame WikiLeaks, James Comey for her election loss. What is your message to Hillary Clinton?
ASSANGE: Well, I don't think Hillary Clinton is particularly important anymore. But the Democratic Party is important. It's important to have a strong opposition. And the Democratic Party now has a moment where it can go through a reformation. They can only go through that reformation if it looks like at the genuine reasons for the loss.
The genuine reasons to my mind for the loss is because the rigging of the primary process. They didn't pick the strongest candidate. So there's an internal market which is the primary process. You battle it out, you have different contenders. And the idea is that the strongest candidate is who you then send off into the main election. That didn't happen. Why didn't it happen? Because the DNC was rigged. The DNC would no longer represent the genuine interests of the Democratic Party. And that's the problem.
So my message to the U.S. Democratic Party is now is a moment for reformation and for a renewal of the Democratic Party. Take the information we have published which shows you who are the different players are and how they worked within the DNC. Learn from it, and reform, because every government has to have a strong opposition to keep it efficient, accountable, honest, et cetera.
HANNITY: Let me ask about your message to Barack Obama through this president. He has now joins the ranks of blaming WikiLeaks and Russia and hacking for having an influence in the election, meanwhile ignoring the documents from China, his own attempt to influence the Israeli election. What would your message to him be?
ASSANGE: There is documented attempt to interfere with the election. We published it, which is the rigging of the primary process.
HANNITY: What an irony, right? There is the proof, but he's not focused on that.
ASSANGE: Right. Barack Obama is now, if you like, is an elder statesman. He should be helping this reformation in the Democratic Party. That should be his position. And to do that properly, he has to be seen as someone who is independent and trustworthy by the Democrats.
HANNITY: An elder statesman.
ASSANGE: He has to pull away entirely from that Hillary Clinton network, pull away entirely, say this was a problem. We've got to learn from it. He is not saying that, and I think that's just a terrible thing for the Democratic Party that he isn't. And, frankly, it's not good for him either. He needs to be seen now as someone who is above all that, that he's above the fray, that he is a fair arbitrator of the different factions.
HANNITY: What would your advice to the incoming president and president- elect Donald Trump be?
ASSANGE: I think it is to learn from that, to learn about the mistakes that were committed by Hillary Clinton, learn from the mistakes of Barack Obama, especially in this area of transparency. If you can get the information out as soon as possible, then you can correct as soon as possible. So I think that Donald Trump early on in his administration, he needs to set a standard. He needs to go to someone in that cabinet, OK, you're a friend, maybe an ally, but you did the wrong thing here by the American people, so you are fired. And that standard needs to be set early that no one is immune to betraying the role.
HANNITY: He can be honest, transparent, and forthright without using the media too, which has been proven to be hostile.
ASSANGE: I think that's a good thing. I think it's a good thing that he can go straight to the public and not have to massage the interests of media proprietors or the journalistic class, which has other interest as well.
HANNITY: Very few people in the media, there was even one major national news organization, that were willing to cover the depth of what WikiLeaks revealed, what these emails revealed, what were the contents of these emails.
Now, I have, for example, a lot of the major headlines. You've got the collusion between media organizations giving Hillary Clinton questions ahead of time, asking for questions that they can ask Republicans in a particular campaign. They are up to their eyeballs.
ASSANGE: You have Donna Brazile.
HANNITY: Donna Brazile is one. John Harwood is another. Katie Couric offered to showcase her personality, in other words, a fluff piece for her. And it goes further than that. Reuters, they have the ""New York Times"" and ""Politico,"" and they are literally giving them editing opportunities before an article is published. I've been interviewed by both those publications and I can assure you that's never happened to me in my life, nor do I think that same consideration was given to Donald Trump.
(END VIDEOTAPE)
HANNITY: All right, when we come back we need your help with a very, very important ""Question of the Day"" straight ahead.
HANNITY: Welcome back to HANNITY. Time for our ""Question of the Day."" This is an easy one. Republicans, should they repeal and replace Obamacare? Yes, yes, please yes. Go to Facebook.com/SeanHannity, @SeanHannity on Twitter, let us know what you think.
Don't forget, tune in tomorrow night at 10:00 eastern. We have Laura Ingraham, Michelle Malkin, and Senator Ted Cruz will all be here. But that is all the time we have left this evening. Thanks for being with us. We'll see you back here tomorrow night."
0	32	 33 von 72	Fox News Network	January 4, 2017 Wednesday	 THE KELLY FILE	 9:00 PM EST		"MEGYN KELLY, FOX NEWS HOST: Breaking tonight, weeks after leaks reports accusing Russia of meddling in the 2016 elections, the U.S. intelligence community finally ready to reveal its finding. Allegedly detailing the Kremlin's dirty trick.
Welcome to THE KELLY FILE, everyone, I am Megyn Kelly. This news breaking just a short time ago as early as tomorrow, President Obama will receive the repots, then it goes to President-elect Donald Trump. Mr. Trump is calling on the intelligence experts to prove the allegations that Russia hacked the Democrats computer systems, then today Mr. Trump went a step further appearing beside with WikiLeaks Chief Julian Assange who claims that Russia did not give him the hack material.
The President-elect tweeting, ""Julian Assange said Russians did not give him the info!"" He is referring to Sean Hannity's interview with Julian Assange. That set-off some Republican members of Congress, Republicans I say, who said that Assange is not a man to be trusted.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I have a lot more faith in our intelligence officers, serving around the world, very smart and experienced analyst that we have here in the nation's capital than I do in people like Julian Assange, I can tell you that much.
PAUL RYAN, SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE: I think the guy is a sycophant for Russia. He leaks, he steals data and compromises National Security.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
KELLY: Today on Capitol Hill, Vice President-elect Mike Pence coming to Mr. Trump's defense and even taking his own swipe at the intelligence experts.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
MIKE PENCE, VICE-PRESIDENT ELECT: I think that the President-elect has expressed his very sincere and healthy American skepticism about intelligence conclusions. Given some of the intelligence failures of recent years, the President-elect has made it clear to the American people that he is skeptical about conclusions. From the bureaucracy and I think the American people here loud and clear.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
KELLY: Joining us to weigh in on all of this, former White House Press Secretary Dana Perino. And Bill Bennett who has advised President-elect Donald Trump.
But first, to our chief intelligence correspondent Catherine Herridge on this new intelligence report. Catherine?
CATHERINE HERRIDGE, FOX NEWS CHIEF INTELLIGENCE CORRESPONDENT: Megyn, tonight we're confirming new information about the intelligence report that investigates foreign meddling. And American elections going back to 2008. The report is more than 50 pages in length. And there are two versions, a classified for Mr. Obama who gets the findings first in an unclassified version that should be public early next week. In a PBS interview, the CIA director is now waiting until tomorrow to make his case.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Do you think the motive of the Russians was to help Donald Trump?
JOHN BRENNAN, CIA DIRECTOR: Again, that is one of the things that we addressed inside the report. I'm not going to address that --
(END VIDEO CLIP)
HERRIDGE: And the FOX News interviewed Julian Assange, the head of Wikileaks that his source for the DNC and Clinton campaign e-mails was not the Russian government and Assange claimed the -- of Clinton campaign manager John Podesta's emails was merely child's play which did not require the skill of a foreign intelligence service.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
JULIAN ASSANGE, WIKILEAKS FOUNDER: Podesta gave out, that his password was the word password. His own staff said this email that you received, this is totally legitimate. So, this is something a 14-year-old kid could have hacked.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
HERRIDGE: The new Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer told MSNBC that Mr. Trump is, quote, ""Really dumb taking on the intelligence community and its conclusions because spies have so many clever ways to get back at you"" -- Megyn.
KELLY: Wow! That's food for thoughts. Catherine, great to see you.
HERRIDGE: It is. You're welcome.
KELLY: Joining me now, Dana Perino, a former White House press secretary for President George W. Bush and co-host of ""THE FIVE."" Good to see you.
DANA PERINO, FORMER WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: Thank you.
KELLY: That is a scary thought but it is true. Who wants to mess with this spy?
PERINO: Yes.
KELLY: Let's just draw a distinction because I think most Americans think well of our intelligence agencies, and say, wait a minute, why would Donald Trump be picking a fight with them? But it's not all, you know, men and women, assets, boots on the ground. There are some political people at the organization who might be saying things with which Donald Trump could take legitimate issue here.
PERINO: Well, I think it's with blessed relief that the intelligence community is going to brief the president and then President-elect and then some sort of document becomes public to all of us next week because this has gone on for about five weeks.
KELLY: Right. Just the election.
PERINO: And some evidence, some proof, some conclusion. I actually think it would be interesting for the President and the President-elect to get the briefing together. So that everybody hears the same words and at the same meeting and come out of it. I think it's extremely unfortunate to have a situation where you have the President-elect at odds with the intelligence community. I think almost unnecessarily so, heading into the inauguration which is at 15 days away.
KELLY: But Trump is irritated that they're assigning motives, right? I mean, he seems to be, yes, he is disputing that it was the Russians based on Julian Assange's comments. But he also doesn't -- he doesn't like that they -- he feels they got ahead of their skis and said, and they did it to help Donald Trump. Because it feels like he legitimizes his election.
PERINO: And I think that he is right to have that concern and you did it here that there were political people, political appointees that were on their way out the door. That push is narrative. And I do think the Democrats are trying to calm themselves and wrap themselves in this cocoon of, we lost the election because of Podesta's emails.
KELLY: Right.
PERINO: And Assange, who I don't trust it all, he's right when he said that Podesta had no security.
KELLY: OMG, if your password is password, change it right now, right now, in the commercial break. Change it.
PERINO: And don't change it to password 1234.
KELLY: And don't change it to corky.
PERINO: Yes. No word either. So, everybody has a little bit of truth in this. And the other thing, and there is a report out today that Donald Trump's administration will change the director of the National Intelligence Office.
KELLY: Yes.
PERINO: Now, I think that those changes were long in the works and probably really good because the office has good intentions, hasn't work out that well in practice, but --
KELLY: And Donald Trump is being advised by Michael Flynn, who knows this whole thing.
PERINO: He knows the whole thing. Right.
KELLY: He knows that there's a lot of bureaucracies and may not be necessary, maybe more, you know, there sort of assuage politicians than to protect Americans. Go ahead.
PERINO: Right. And Democrats are trying -- will then connect -- they'll say, well Donald Trump's -- about the Russia issue. So therefore he is going to change and punish the intelligence community by changing the -- I don't think that that is the case. Everything is getting a little bit too muddled. It's be wildering for Americans and guess, the intelligence community deserve support and I think some of the changes that they're planning to make at the DNI are good ones for the community.
KELLY: Okay. But let's talk about the actual thing that Donald Trump is a saying which is, he's accepting Carte Blanche that the Russians did not hack the DNC. And we don't know that.
PERINO: No, we don't.
KELLY: We don't know that.
PERINO: You know who else doesn't know that?
KELLY: Who?
PERINO: Assange doesn't know that.
KELLY: Well, let me just say this. This is an interesting exchange he had with Hannity. Hannity asked him, 100 percent, you did not get it from Russia. Yes, he says, correct. And Hannity says, or anybody associated with Russia? And Assange says, we can't say and we have said repeatedly that our source is not the Russian government. It is not a state party. So he would not go as far as to say anybody associated with Russia. That's where the hairy split. That tells you something.
PERINO: And he may not know.
KELLY: Okay. So it wasn't Vladimir Putin. But --
PERINO: Miss Dmitri.
KELLY: He's not dumb enough to do it himself or to have one of his top lieutenants do it.
PERINO: Right.
KELLY: We don't really have any answers yet.
PERINO: Right.
KELLY: We don't really have any answers yet.
PERINO: Right.
KELLY: So, as we point out, Friday is just a few days away.
PERINO: We will get the briefing.
KELLY: Does Donald Trump accept it? Do you think that the Intel Agencies there say, I'm sorry to tell you this sir, but it was Russia.
PERINO: I think he may accept it. But I think he is also right to continue to say that the Democrats, that this notion that Russia is interfering was actually the thing that helped get Donald Trump elected.
KELLY: Yes. That's why we have to draw the line.
PERINO: That logic doesn't actually flow for me. I don't see it there and I think he's right to push back on that.
KELLY: And John Brennan says, that that's going to be addressed in this report, that we're all going to see --
PERINO: We'll see. I hope it's definitive.
KELLY: The motive. Dana, great to see you.
PERINO: Thank you.
KELLY: Joining us now with more. Bill Bennett, FOX News contributor, former education secretary and chairman of the conservative leaders for education.
Bill, great to see you.
BILL BENNETT, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Thank you.
KELLY: So let's start with that. The Democrats believe -- not all of them but they believe that -- some are pushing is that Putin wanted Trump elected because he thought he would be a pushover, he thinks he is friendly towards Putin because Putin flatters him. Donald Trump replies well to flattery. Do you buy that?
BENNETT: Yes, that is the unstated premise. Good for you, Megyn. This is the notion that the Democrats want to push. And you can hear that in a month or two or three months while Trump is the president but that's because the Russians got him in there. If you think about it, step back. First of all, we have no evidence that any votes has changed because of any Russian interference. And I believe the Russians were trying to hack in.
KELLY: So you don't believe necessarily Julian Assange when he says, no, it wasn't Russia.
BENNETT: I don't believe the Russians. I don't believe Julian Assange. I'd call that what we say in philosophy insufficient options. You know, and Julian Assange says it wasn't the Russian government. Good distinctions you made. It could have been someone that said I'm not the Russian government.
KELLY: Uh-hm.
BENNETT: You know, I mean, how does he know? It's very complicated. Thanks goodness we're going to get resolution of this. But back to the larger question, why all this fuss? Because I think the Democrats want to suggest this election was somehow illegitimate because the Russians wanted Trump to win. But if you step back and think about it, why would the Russians want Trump to win?
He has promised to rebuild the military and the strategic arsenal. He has promised energy independence, both very bad. Thanks for the Russians. Second point. When have the Russians thrived in the last five or six years, have they gotten weaker or stronger? Obama and Clinton have been very good for Russian power. Trump will not be good for Russian power. So, I think the basic premise undercuts the notion here that the liberals or Democrats tried to --
KELLY: Okay. But in the Democrats defense, if the Russians messed with our election by, you know, hacking Podesta, hacking the DNC, just for kicks, right? Let's say, it wasn't to help Donald Trump but it was just a mess with us. That is a huge deal. Right? I mean, we do need to know who did it.
BENNETT: Sure. Sure.
KELLY: There do need to be consequences to it.
BENNETT: Absolutely.
KELLY: And can we have our president rejecting the assessment of the 17 Intel agencies if they say, I know you love Vladimir Putin or you want to get along with him, but he did something bad that you're going to have to deal with.
BENNETT: Right, I don't think he's rejected it. He hasn't rejected outright. He has raised questions. He said, it could be the Russian, it could be Chinese, it could be a guy found there lying in bed.
KELLY: But he keeps talking about Assange. He says, it wasn't the Russians. I mean, he certainly sounds like he is a believer.
BENNETT: I know, but we will find out in a day or two. Look, they have some skepticism about the intelligence community. It's okay. Look, I had briefings from the intelligence community when I was a drug czar, some of them are right, some of them were not. Dana pointed out that you may have some who political appointees trying to influence. Remember David Nunez, Megyn, he was trying to have hearing to get all the intelligence agencies to deliver what it is they had, and they canceled the hearing?
KELLY: Yes.
BENNETT: Thanks goodness! In 48 hours, we may get to the final truths of this. Sunlight is the best disinfectant, Justice Brandeis said. Let's see it all and then we'll know. I like the idea of the two of them getting briefed together. That would be an interesting notion.
KELLY: Can you imagine how awkward that would be? Like, if they spoke over each other -- like the poor Intel briefers like, uh, uh. Anyway, great to see you, Bill.
BENNETT: Thank you. Good to see you.
KELLY: Breaking tonight, four people are under arrest after a truly ugly video surfaces out of Chicago. A young man tied up, his mouth taped shut. We've blurred it in part here. He is kicked, beaten, and threatened with a knife by a group of people shouting F-Trump, and F-white people.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (Bleep) Donald Trump! (Bleep) White people!
(END VIDEO CLIP)
KELLY: What's worse is the police say the man being beaten is mentally disabled. We are gathering more information right now, the police have just spoken out about this publicly. We will tell you what they said shortly.
Plus, President Obama and Republican leaders went head to head in Capitol today in a new war over ObamaCare. It was a very interesting day on Capitol Hill. And this one affects millions of patients. This next battle. Millions of taxpayers. And everyone who basically goes to the doctor. Two of America's top experts on this are next on what is likely to happen here.
And then new fighting about the folks being discussed for the U.S. Supreme Court.
Judge Andrew Napolitano is just ahead on what's behind the controversy.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY), MAJORITY LEADER: To not confirm a Supreme Court nominee at all. I think that is something the American people simply will not tolerate and we will be looking forward to receiving a Supreme Court nomination and moving forward on it.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
KELLY: Developing tonight, a new fallout after President Obama and Republican leaders went head to head on Capitol Hill today over the faith of ObamaCare. President Obama speaking to Congressional Democrats behind closed doors this afternoon, imploring them not to, quote, ""Rescue Republicans"" by helping the effort to replace the law.
At the same time, Vice President-elect Mike Pence was promising members that repealing the law and then replacing it with a better system will be the new administration's first order of business. So, what does all of this mean for ObamaCare future and for you?
Trace Gallagher has that report live in our West Coast Newsroom. Trace?
TRACE GALLAGHER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Megyn, any doubts about ObamaCare being the battle of the year were erased today as leaders of both parties tugged on the rope. In an effort to save his signature law, President Obama went to Capitol Hill to fire up his team. But the President knows full well his party does not have the votes to block Republicans, so instead, he is advising Democratic lawmakers not to rescue them. By helping to pass replacement measures. Mr. Obama is also recommending that any changes to the law should now be labeled TrumpCare and at some Democratic lawmakers have adopted a spin on Trump's Make America Great Again slogan by pushing the phrase, ""Make America Sick Again."" Watch.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY), SENATE MINORITY LEADER: Republicans will soon learn that you can't keep the good parts of the ACA and remove the rest of the law and still have it work.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
GALLAGHER: The Republicans say, they are planning on doing just that. Today, GOP lawmakers also huddled on Capitol Hill to lay out plans to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. With Vice President-elect Mike Pence vowing that Donald Trump is a man of his word. Listen.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
GOV. MIKE PENCE (R-IN), VICE-PRESIDENT ELECT: Today our message is very simple. Working with the leadership here in the House and the Senate, we are going to be in the promise keeping business.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
GALLAGHER: And the President-elect weighed in on twitter reminding his party to not let Democrats off the hook for ObamaCare saying, quote, ""Republicans must be careful and that the Dems owned the failed ObamaCare disaster with its poor coverage and massive premium increases."" Top Republican like House Speaker Paul Ryan and Senator Rand Paul are also warning their colleagues not to pull the rag out on people. In other words, before you repeal, make sure you can replace -- Megyn.
KELLY: Uh-hm. Trace, thank you. Well Republicans maybe vowing to repeal ObamaCare but with no replacement lined up, what would happen next?
Avik Roy is the Forbes opinion editor and President of the Foundation for Research on Equal Opportunity. And Austan Goolsbee is President Obama's former chief economist. Great to see you both.
So that would be a pickle. Right? I mean, you are the person I think knows the most about this stuff. We've been talking to you about ObamaCare since I don't know when. Since Obama was like a baby. And you tell me if they manage to repeal and they are not able to replace, what happens?
AVIK ROY, OPINION EDITOR, FORBES: Well, Megyn, there is one word in this whole ObamaCare fight that matters more than any other. And that's the filibuster. I've done something really special tonight, Megyn. I've stolen Karl Rove's whiteboard. I got it right here.
KELLY: Oh, this is good.
ROY: Here's something that we are going to show you. That the thing that ObamaCare bid and had in 2009 and 2010, when Democrats controlled the Senate, they had 60 votes to pass the key parts of ObamaCare. Republicans this time around only has 52 votes, and that means, yes, they can defund ObamaCare, they can take some of the fund away from ObamaCare. But the thing that you and I have talked about so many times on the show, Megyn, is how the regulations in ObamaCare are driving up the premiums.
And if you don't reform the regulations, you can't really repeal and replace ObamaCare in full. So how are Republicans going to get 60 votes that they need to impose or institute their own reforms for their health care system? That's going to be a challenge. And what I've argued, is that the way to do it is to give the Democrats something they want. Cover as many people as possible. But do it in a consumer driven way in which people have actual choice, in the kind of insurance plans they can buy.
KELLY: So, you heard it there, Austan, they need Democrat buy-in if they want to do it right and if they don't do it right, we are back to Trump's warning which is, be careful because right now this is hanging around the necks of Democrats. To the extent ObamaCare is not working, and it could soon be a Republican problem.
AUSTAN GOOLSBEE, FORMER CHIEF ECONOMIST TO PRESIDENT OBAMA: Oh, it is a Republican problem, are you kidding? Look, Megyn, we talked about this throughout the campaign, that Donald Trump was proposing things that contradicted -- he contradicted himself, he wanted the key parts of the law, he wanted to say, get rid of the whole law and experts from both sides kept saying, wait a minute, it doesn't make sense.
For him to do what he's saying would blow the system up. And now he is actually going to be the president and they are trying to sort it out and they are not going to be able to. The problem that Obama had is when you do anything in the health care system, you then own everyone's problems, everything everyone hates about that.
KELLY: Everything that has ever happened in the health care system, that's on you.
GOOLSBEE: All of that stuff. They attribute to ObamaCare, even things that have nothing to do with ObamaCare. And now the Republicans are about to do the reverse. If they get rid of ObamaCare, if they fundamentally alter it, anybody that's complaining about the health care system will be transformed into, oh, what did you think was going to happen when you destroyed ObamaCare?
KELLY: Uh-hm. And yet, they had to do something. Like they have to do something. Trump ran on a promise that he would. These Republicans are from districts that want it. Repealed and replace. And there is a real question about whether Senator Schumer is right, you can't take away -- you can't still have the good stuff, the universal coverage, you know, whatever. The coverage of pre-existing conditions -- without he didn't say it, but without the bad stuff. The mandates.
ROY: Yes. And this is where Democrats in my view are totally wrong. In my Think Tank, the foundation for Research on Equal Opportunity. You can go to our website, FreeApp.org. We have published a plan called transcending ObamaCare that does everything the Democrats claim to support. It covers more people, 12 million more people than ObamaCare but at 20 percent lower premiums.
With much more choice, much more access. It can be done. This idea that ObamaCare is the only way to make sure that people have access to health insurance coverage is not true. If you give people a choice, if you give Americans control again of their own health care dollars, they'll be able to choose the plans that are right for them at much lower cost than ObamaCare does. So I don't think it's an either or choice.
KELLY: All right. Well, I think it's interesting that Donald Trump interviewed and sat down with Dr. Ezekiel Emanuel who -- he really knows a lot about -- New York attacks. And listen to him. He's got a lot of thoughts on how you could potentially keep the good stuff while, you know, while getting rid of the mandate although he doesn't love that idea. Great to see you both.
ROY: Thank you, Megyn.
GOOLSBEE: Good to see you, Megyn.
KELLY: So, it could turn into the biggest fight of President Trump's first term. And Judge Napolitano is next on why the new controversy exists now over filling a Supreme Court seat.
Wait until you hear the reversal that the Democrats have done on this. And then Karl Rove and Mo Elleithee will join us with the debate over which way this Supreme Court employment likely to go.
Plus, Mr. Trump may have fired her from ""The Apprentice"" but he just hired her at the White House. Tonight, Omarosa is here for her first interviews since being top to work in the West Wing.
ANNOUNCER: From the World Headquarters of FOX News, it is THE KELLY FILE with Megyn Kelly.
KELLY: Well, one of the earliest decisions from President-elect Donald Trump will be when he becomes president, the selection of a Supreme Court justice. To fill the vacancy created by Antonin Scalia's death last February. While Mr. Trump's final pick has yet to be announced, the issue was already creating controversy.
And Shannon Bream was reporting from Washington on why.
SHANNON BREAM, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Whoever gets the nod from the President-elect would expect criticism from the left but there are a growing concerns from some on the right. A coalition of pro-life groups and leaders has sent a letter saying they are worried about some of the candidates on the list of 21 potential picks Mr. Trump has released. Quote, ""We urge you not to consider candidates lacing a pro-life record. Several of these judges on the list have even written or spoken in ways that are at odds with the pro-life position.""
Well, a Trump transition team says, not to worry, all are being thoroughly vetted. Here's Leonard Leo, a transition member who is advising Mr. Trump on the contenders.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
LEONARD LEO, TRUMP TRANSITION TEAM MEMBER: There is no one particular statement or comment by any of this perspective nominees that can be viewed in isolation. So, we certainly appreciate what the pro-life community and other groups are doing to weigh in on these various nominees and all of that information is being taken into consideration very, very carefully.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
BREAM: First, liberty institute group that takes on religious freedom legal fights has been pouring through all the opinions of the judges on Mr. Trump's list and says, there is a way to calm conservative fears.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
KELLY SHACKELFORD, CEO, FIRST LIBERTY INSTITUTE: There are many other excellent judges on the list that have no red flags and in fact are very solid judicial background that would make excellent choices at the U.S. Supreme Court.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
BREAM: It will take 60 votes in the Senate to get any Supreme Court nominee passed the first procedural hurdles. So, unless something changes, Republicans will need some help from across the aisle -- Megyn.
KELLY: Shannon, thank you. Well, my next guest has consulted with President-elect Trump about his eventual pick for the Supreme Court. Judge Andrew Napolitano is our FOX News senior judicial analyst. So, who is it going to be?
JUDGE ANDREW NAPOLITANO, FOX NEWS SENIOR JUDICIAL ANALYST: Well, I don't know who it's going to be. But he wants a person most like Justice Scalia. Not necessarily in terms of temperament and personality --
KELLY: Too bad because --
(CROSSTALK)
NAPOLITANO: Yes he was, but in terms of the idea that the meaning of the constitution was fixed at the time it was ratified. A theory generally called originalism. This is not just something in the weeds. It profoundly affects how judges rule. Justice Ginsburg for example believes that constitution changes to adapt to political needs.
KELLY: Living breathing document.
NAPOLITANO: Correct. President-Elect Trump rejects that and takes the Scalia view that if the constitution is going to change, that states is going to ratify amendments, because that is the only way it can change.
KELLY: that is Justice Scalia use to say from the bench. He used to say, you want to say that there is a constitutional right to an abortion or to have certain kinds of relations and so on.
NAPOLITANO: Right.
KELLY: Why do you want nine guys or gals in robes up here to make that decision? You go get the American people, that an amendment and make it clear that the constitutional rights.
NAPOLITANO: So he is looking for a person who generally accepts that view of judging from a Supreme Court.
KELLY: Now in your view, will the Democrats ever vote to confirm another originalist?
NAPOLITANO: No. And the reason I can say that because they said so today, Senator Schumer on another network said the unthinkable. After ripping into the Republicans for their refusal of hearings of Merrick Garland, they prevalent call for a judge that somebody nominated in the lame-duck part of President Obama's presidency. He has suggested that the Democrats might engage in enough parliamentary tricks to prevent President-Elect from President's Trump nominee from even being voted upon in the senate until the 2018 congressional election. When the Democrats think, they will control the senate.
KELLY: We are going to talk about his flip-flop his incredible, obvious flip-flop in a minute. But what would that mean for the Supreme Court, if they were stuck with eight justices for the next couple years?
NAPOLITANO: Well a tie vote in the Supreme Court, which doesn't always happen but has happened, means that the decision below becomes the law. It's not a ruling on the merit. It is just a refusal to disturb that decision below. But I can tell you that the Supreme Court does want a ninth member, no matter who it is. Because they feel they have more integrity when they have a full membership. President Trump believes that.
KELLY: When he was confirmed in the '80s, right?
NAPOLITANO: Yes.
KELLY: It is all part of the nation, still divided government, it was confirmed I think it was in 98-0.
NAPOLITANO: Correct.
KELLY: He doesn't have anything against it. It was two people were missing.
NAPOLITANO: Correct.
KELLY: It wasn't that there were fewer liberals or Democrats.
NAPOLITANO: It was a different time, it was more civility. It doesn't matter, no matter who it is -- that this will happen that time.
KELLY: Great to see you Judge.
NAPOLITANO: Likewise.
KELLY: Well the Judge has mention. Senate Minority leader Chuck Schumer is already threatening to keep the seat vacant for the duration of Mr. Trump's presidency. I'm sure he always felt this way. Well, wait, wait, it's a dramatic turn actually, from the position taken by the New York senator, just last year when it was a Democratic president choosing the nominee.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
CHUCK SCHUMER, SENATE MINORITY LEADER: He doesn't even know who the president is going to propose and he said no, we are not having hearings. We are not going to forward to lead the leave the Supreme Court vacant for 300 days in a divided time. This kind of obstructionism is going to last and you know, we Democrats did not do this. It is hard for me to imagine a nominee that Donald Trump would choose that would get the Republican and support that we can support. So you are right.
KELLY: So you would do your best to hold the seat open?
SCHUMER: Absolutely.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
KELLY: And they wonder why the approval rings are so very low. Joining me now Karl Rove, former Deputy Chief of Staff under President Georg W. Bush and a Fox News Political Contributor and Mo Elleithee founding Director of Georgetown University Institute of Politics and Public Service. Let me start with you on this one, Mo, as a Democrat. That is my question, to you.
MOE ELLEITHEE, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY INSTITUTE OF POLITICS: You've got to love congress. Both sides have gone back and forth on this. I listen to Mitch McConnell's response to that today and he sounded like Chuck Schumer did back then, right? You know, I think there is one important distinction here. I'm going to come around and knock my party a little bit and a second. But I think there's one important distinction between this and what the Republicans did in the with the Garland nomination. They said we are not going to even entertain or listen to a hearing on anybody that President Obama nominates. They said he shouldn't even make a nomination. That is not what Chuck Schumer is saying, what he is saying is we don't want someone who is going to be outside the mainstream. He is not saying we won't hold a hearing, she saying we probably won't vote for someone on less it's in the mainstream. It sounds more like a leveraging tool here.
Having said that, they do run the risk of sounding like obstructionist and nobody sounds good whether it is Democrats or Republicans when they sound like obstructionist. I would hope Democrats say more along the lines of this is what we want to see. No different than when Republicans say, we won't support a candidate who is pro-choice. It Democrats say, we are not going to accept someone against the mainstream.
KELLY: You know what Karl, the Republicans say things like that, that is true, but we have a Justice Alanna Cagan and a justice Sonia Sotomayor sitting on the U.S. Supreme Court, nominated by president Obama a Democrat, because Republicans, they did get through, they were not stop and the question is - I understand this has gotten politicized after Robert you get bounced out of they are if you are considered two partisan, but it didn't used to be this way. Is there ever going to be a point where we do what was intended? Which is you look these nominees and you decide whether they are qualified as a U.S. Senator and you don't try to Trump the will of the president who is duly elected by the American people.
KARL ROVE, FORMER SENIOR ADVISOR TO PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH: First of all, let me thank you for inviting me earlier for using my whiteboard, Andrew Jackson in return, so I really appreciated that.
KELLY: Oh, you do get money for that?
ROVE: It was my whiteboard. You think I am going to let him use it free? I am a free marketer and so is he.
ELLEITHEE: (Inaudible)
(LAUGHTER)
KELLY: I know it used to be rented.
ROVE: Now look, let's put this in a little bit of perspective. For 80 years, no president in their last year has been able to nominate and see confirmed a nominee for the Supreme Court, Democrat or Republican. This has been around for a long time. Joe Biden in June of 1992 said if President George H. Bush nominates anybody, we shouldn't even consider them until after the November elections. You have basically six weeks in order to name somebody, do the background, and hand over all the material, have the hearings. That has never happened at least in the modern era. Chuck Schumer rose this a little bit earlier in July of 2007 and he said if Bush nominates anybody in the last 18 months, we are not going to change. We are not going to take in to confirm.
KELLY: And he said we should reverse the presumption of confirmation. We should make them prove that they are in the mainstream rather than us having to prove that they are not.
ROVE: Exactly right. And now he changed for last year for political reasons. I write this off largely to playing to the cameras and playing to the base and trying to demonstrate that he is going to be a strong, effective leader for the left-wing Democratic Party. But his problem is in 2018, he is got a lot of Democrats in states like Montana, North Dakota, in Missouri, in Indiana, and Ohio, in West Virginia, who not going to be inclined to march off into San Francisco Bay or live in a tent in Cambridge, Massachusetts. As a result, I think it's going to be very hard to keep up.
KELLY: I will give you the final word, Mo. Go ahead.
ELLEITHEE: Look we just heard a report from Shannon Bream who said, that there is conservatives out there saying, they don't want to entertain a Republican or a nominee who is not pro-life, who is pro-choice. I think it is fair for senators to go in there and say these are the benchmarks by which I will or will not support a nominee, well put them up for a vote, left the senate then have the hearing. Left the senate and have the vote, use whatever benchmark you want to decide what votes you are going to be, but have the vote. That is where I think the Republicans had the bigger problem with the Garland thing done this.
KELLY: I will just give you one set, Tony Sotomayor, confirmed by the senate 68-31. That means she has some bipartisan support, this is how it is going in a direction that I would submit to you is going to be never intended. Good to see you both.
Breaking tonight, we're getting new details on a truly horrifying it attack in Chicago. Filmed and broadcasted on Facebook.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (BEEP) Donald Trump. (BEEP) white people.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
KELLY: Four people now under arrest. And David Wohl and Richard Fowler are next on why this could become a federal case.
KELLY: Breaking tonight, four people now in custody following a disturbing video posted to Facebook live. It showed a man being held hostage and apparently tortured in Chicago. We warn you. It is disturbing.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (BEEP) Donald Trump, (BEEP) white people.
(LAUGHTER)
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: My sister said this is not funny.
(BEEP)
(END VIDEO CLIP)
KELLY: In moments, we will be joined by David Wohl, and Richard Fowler with reaction, but first we check in with Trace Gallagher who has the new details on the breaking news, Trace.
GALLAGHER: Megyn, police believe the victim who is mentally disabled met a man that he knew and some others on the Chicago suburbs and that they drove him in a stolen car to the west side of Chicago, took him to a home, tied him up, taped his mouth and began torturing him for between 24 and 48 hours. At least 30 minutes of the torture was streamed live on Facebook and the woman who was taping acknowledged that she knows it is streaming live. During the video which as you say is very hard to watch, they cut the man's clothing, saying they are going to get him naked and ask him to kiss the floor. Then they kick him, punch him, cut his scalp and laugh about how much he is bleeding. Throughout the video, you can hear the four suspects going after Donald Trump and white people. Let's watch again.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (BEEP) Donald Trump, (BEEP) white people.
(LAUGHTER)
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: My sister said this is not funny.
(BEEP)
(END VIDEO CLIP)
GALLAGHER: later they ask the victim to say how much he loves black people. Police are now investigating this if this is a possible hate crime and possible kidnapping. They also say it could be a case of young people making stupid decisions. Here is Chicago superintendent Eddie Johnson.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
EDDIE JOHNSON, CHACAGO SUPERINTENDENT: It is sickening. It makes you wonder what would make individuals treat somebody like that. And also, I have been a cop for 28 years I have seen things that you shouldn't see in a lifetime. It still amazes me how you still see things that you just shouldn't.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
GALLAGHER: Officers found the victim distressed and wandering the streets of west Chicago, they say he is out of the hospital and being interviewed by detectives but it's having a very difficult time communicating. The four suspects including at least two females that are all 18 years old, they remained in custody, Megyn.
KELLY: Trace, thank you. Joining me now David Wohl, who is an attorney and Donald Trump supporter. And Richard Fowler who is a Nationally Syndicated Radio Host and a Fox News Contributor, deeply disturbing, mentally challenged young man tortured for a day? First of all, what kind of crimes are we looking at here, David, and do they include a hate crime increase? Because of the racial undertones and the language we heard.
DAVID WOHL, TRUMP SUPPORTER: The underlying crimes, Megyn are kidnapping, torture, assault with deadly weapon, false imprisonment probably several others. What I found a little bit disturbing is the cops in a press conference, they are not quite sure if this is a hate crime. It is being investigated. That is after viewing this video. Rest assured, if the races were reversed, and they said that they would be fired the next day. I think Richard would agree with that. So what is going to happen here is, they only prosecuted regarding the state crimes and they leave this hate crime, don't forget who's going to be the attorney general of the United States in a couple months. Jeff Sessions. I guarantee he takes this very seriously. This could easily turn into a federal civil rights prosecution along with several other piggybacking federal crimes. And the hate crime would definitely be included. They need to take this very seriously. They can't allow political correctness to dictate the prosecution here.
KELLY: I don't know, that is obviously a legal call and I know you not here to play the role of legal analyst but what you make of it, a hate crime. You get an aggravation when someone is committing the crime based on race. And in the tape you hear them say [bleep] white people.
RICHARD FOWLER, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR AND SENIOR FELLOW FOR THE NEW LEADERS COUNSEL: This is a hate crime, I don't care what race you are and that is why we have hate crimes in this law. And folks like Joe Biden worked at night and day to keep those laws. Politics aside, it's disgusting and I think, we as a nation, black, white, yellow, blue, orange, purple and have a conversation about how we really come together. How we come together as Christians and Muslims. And have this larger conversation. We are all American. This is sickening.
KELLY: Let me ask you something, does this one act. This disgusting, awful, criminal act is it any sort of a larger statement on who we are as a people? Or are these guys just thugs? Not just young people making stupid decisions, thugs. Who are torturing a man, but does it say something about us as Americans?
FOWLER: Here is the thing, I think what we can read what the election show us, that's why we as Democrats or Republican, our nation is pretty much equally divided. Some people sit on one side. Other people sit on the other. And it's really time for us to come together and really have a conversation about how we work together to keep America being the great country it is. We only thrive when we work together. Some of our best moments are when we work together.
KELLY: You tell me David, whether people who are so depraved that they would they would do this to another human being, one who is mentally challenged no less, can be reached by an effort at the federal or any other level for us to come together.
WOHL: Well you know, Megyn I think you are right about that. The other thing is they think somehow that sort of invoking Trump is sort of their ticket to doing this, because everybody hates Trump. They see celebrities hating on Trump so they put his name on there and somehow that fuels or gives them justification. I will say this. It's another social media problem Megyn. We see social media propelling this. They think it is cool when it on social media, they get their 15 minutes of fame. The good thing is that somebody saw it on social media and apparently reported it. To that extent, it turns out well.
FOWLER: I beg to differ on that. If it wasn't on social media, then we wouldn't be talking about it tonight.
KELLY: I know. That is right. The videos so shocking that it requires attention and it became national news in an instance. Not enough lifting note to end the segment on but an important story. Thank you.
WOHL: Thank you.
FOWLER: Thank you, Megyn.
KELLY: Well Mr. Trump may have fired her from the apprentice, but he has hired her at the White House. And tonight Omarosa, is here for her first interview since tap to work in the West Wing, next.
KELLY: Major news from the President-Elect team this week as they make what they are calling the first wave of additional staff announcements. One may be drawing more attention than others as one woman goes from an unsuccessful contestant on Mr. Trump's reality show two being a role in his White House. Joining me now Omarosa Manigault, who is just name assistant to the president and director of communication from the office of public via son. It is a mouthful. What does it mean?
OMAROSA MANIGAULT, FORMER CONTESTANT ON THE APPRENTICE AND DIRECTOR OF AFRICAN-AMERICAN OUTREACH: Public engagement is so important particularly to President-Elect Trump, because he wants to connect with Americans. He wants to hear that there are issues that are in their community. And we are going to fight for them to. So my role is to go into the communities and continue the work that I was already doing on the campaign and with the national diversity coalition.
KELLY: What interesting about you, this is not your first time working in the White House. Last time it was for a Democratic administration, President Al Gore, right?
MANIGAULT: I worked for Gore and I was deputy associate director of presidential personnel for Bill Clinton.
KELLY: And obviously you voted for Bill Clinton.
MANIGAULT: I did in fact.
KELLY: Are you a Barack Obama supporter too?
MANIGAULT: I was, you know traditionally, I think that the Democrats have taken advantage and taken advantage for the African-American vote. We see a huge movement of African-Americans moving to the Republican side. And I am one of them, I'm a Trumplican.
(LAUGHTER)
KELLY: I have not heard that. That is the first time I heard that.
(LAUGHTER)
KELLY: I have to ask you, because we are talking about your role on the White House you made controversy earlier this year on this PBS frontline documentary when you said, well, I will just play the sound bite.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
MANIGAULT: Every critic, every detractor will have to bow down to President Trump. It's anyone who is ever doubted Donald. Whoever disagreed, who ever challenge him, it is the ultimate revenge to become the most powerful man on the universe.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
MANIGAULT: Wow. It sounds so ominous with the music.
KELLY: It does with the music and the lighting. You want to explain that?
MANIGAULT: Probably four or five months before I joined the campaign. I think if you look back on all of the people that said Donald Trump would never be the president of the United States, who mocked him, who made fun of him, who made wagers, and all of the poser who are wrong, I think out of 30 only two of them had him winning. And yes, this is the moment were people who stop who said that he will never be president have to stop and recognize that Donald Trump will be the 46 president of the United States.
KELLY: But no bowing. Great to see you, Omarosa see you soon.
KELLY: So it is a New Year and time for a little inspiration. That is the one word I hear more than any other about how people feel on reading settle for more, my memoir. Sarah Nemon for example tweets, I never felt more capable of chasing my dream, challenging myself, and settling for more. She thought it is inspirational. Bobby spoke this is a great confidence booster and motivator, like giving one internal strength and fire. I like that, Bobby. Kaitlyn Smith wrote, so inspiring. I laughed, I cried, me too. And it taught me how to be stronger woman. Jake Purtua tweets out, such a great story, especially for young people with big aspirations. I highly recommend it.
So the book has been in the top ten in ""The New York Times"" bestseller list for seven weeks now, and if you would like to read something that might inspire you to be your strongest most fiery self, check it out. ""Settle for more."" Good night, everybody, see you tomorrow."

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'm just thinking about the kids. Didn't want to see more kids laying on the ground bloodied.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: When I look down at the park, it smells like urine down there, it seems like we don't have no police.
O'REILLY (voice-over): In Chicago, murder is out of control. In San Francisco, property crime through the roof. And there are political reasons why. Tonight, ""Talking Points"" will address it.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: If you walk out (bleep) on the street (INAUDIBLE) (bleep). 
O'REILLY: Incredibly California minors can now sell themselves for sex without punishment. When will you hear about this?
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I felt disgust before, but never, never the kind of fear that you feel now. It's as simple as the fear of, is someone simply competent enough to do this particular job?
O'REILLY: Also ahead, why is singer Bruce Springsteen continuing to bash Donald Trump? Martha MacCallum on the case.
(END VIDEOTAPE)
O'REILLY: Caution. You are about to enter the ""No Spin Zone."" THE FACTOR begins right now.
Hi, I'm Bill O'Reilly. Thanks for watching us tonight. A tale of two cities. And that is the subject of this evenings Talking Points Memo. As we have been reporting, the city of Chicago is the most violent place in America. And little is being done about the incredible murder rate in some black neighborhoods. A quick look at the stats. Last year murders in Chicago were up 57 percent from 2015. Shooting incidents up 46 percent. Shooting victims of 46 percent. On New Year's Day alone, 28 people shot in Chicago.
Obvious that Mayor Rahm Emanuel and the Governor Bruce Rauner will not protect innocent people and solve the problem. But what is the problem? The vast majority of shootings are being done by low-level gang members who are running wild in the streets. Investigation by the ""Chicago Sun-Times"" shows that even if the cops do find a gang member with a gun, even if they arrest them, that person when convicted given a very light sentence, maybe a year for having a gun.
So, the justice system in Cook County, Chicago, not punishing the thugs convicted of carrying illegal weapons with any severity at all. That is problem number one. Secondly, policing. Here in New York City, shooting incidents are at an all-time record low. And this is a tougher town than Chicago. The reason shootings are down here is because the NYPD target the gangs and arrest them for any and all violations. They hound gang members, truth be told.
But in Chicago, the opposite is true. Police do not want any part of engaging violent gang members. Why? Because the liberal politicians in Chicago are making it impossible for street cops to do their jobs. In fact, the ACLU is now running street crime in the windy city. Mayor Emanuel has instituted an ACLU suggested policy that mandates a two-page police report every time a cop stopped someone for questioning.
That means the police are spending hours filling out paperwork, if they even ask anyone what they are doing on the street corner at 4:00 a.m. How insane is that? And then there is the racist angle. Most of those shot in Chicago are poor black people. If the mass murder were happening in Chicago's business district, believe me, it would be stopped cold. So, Mayor Emanuel and Governor Rauner can be accused of racism because they allow the madness to continue. They allow it.
Now let's look at San Francisco. There, its property crime. Since 2010, crimes like arson, car theft, larceny are up a whopping 64 percent. Why? Because San Francisco politicians have stopped the police from enforcing quality-of-life crimes. Therefore, homeless people are all over the place. Urinating and defecating on the streets, panhandling. And when they need money to buy booze and drugs, committing crimes.
The situation is out of control and a disgrace. And that's what happens when incompetent politicians demand the police stop enforcing laws. Look, there's a civility factor in every country. With nearly 325 million folks living in America, there have to be some standards of public behavior. But in San Francisco, there are none. You can do whatever you want in the street. And therefore, a beautiful city has now become blighted.
Add to that insane social policies like San Francisco's general assistance program. Ready? This city gives indigent people, homeless, those roaming around, 300 bucks a month in cash and benefits. And where does that money go? Many times to buy drugs and alcohol. So, if you are a west coast drug addict, where would you go? San Francisco. Where the money is free. Summing up, terrible loss, cowardly politicians, apathetic voters all lead to violence and chaos. People continue to die in Chicago, and San Francisco is a mess. But unless voters wise up, nothing will change.
And that's the memo.
Now for the top story reaction, joining us from Washington, George Terwilliger, who was deputy Attorney General under President Bush the elder. Also Ken Cuccinelli, the former Attorney General for the Commonwealth of Virginia. So, Cuccinelli, I'll begin with you. Well, there are people dying right now.
KEN CUCCINELLI (R), FORMER ATTORNEY GENERAL OF VIRGINIA: Yep.
O'REILLY: Okay? And the local government and state government of Illinois, local government in Chicago.
CUCCINELLI: Right.
O'REILLY: We can't handle it. We can't stop it. I think this can be stopped. Do you disagree?
CUCCINELLI: No, I don't disagree at all. And you can look at Rudy Giuliani's tenure as mayor of New York. He was elected in a liberal city for two reasons. The failure of the economic policies before him and the rise in crime that even liberals wanted to get rid of. And a lot of people said just what you just did, Bill. Gosh. It just can't be stopped. There is no point in doing this. Well, Rudy Giuliani prove them wrong, and he did it starting with the kind of low-level crime you were talking about in San Francisco. That invites more crime. And then of course, when you are paying people to come and do drugs, et cetera, you're going to get more people showing up.
O'REILLY: Okay. But you are the governor of Illinois, Mr. Cuccinelli.
CUCCINELLI: Right.
O'REILLY: All right? What do you do tomorrow? What do you do?
CUCCINELLI: Yes. Your only real short-term option Bill is to flood the zone with police. But if your judges are only going to give them slaps on the wrist, even that is --
O'REILLY: But that would inhibit -- call for the National Guard. And that brings us to you Mr. Terwilliger. Okay? Donald Trump has said, look, if Rahm Emanuel can't do it, the federal government may have to. I don't know if the federal government has the authority to march in to the south and west sides of Chicago and do anything, do they?
GEORGE TERWILLIGER, FORMER DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL: No. They can do a lot with law enforcement but not with the National Guard or military troops unless the situation were to go into complete civil unrest. And as bad as it is, it's not that.
O'REILLY: So, if you were the governor of Illinois, what would you do to stop the, you know, it's mass murder in ghetto neighborhoods. That's what it is. What would you do?
TERWILLIGER: Well, two things I think, Bill. First, you nailed it when you said at the end of your memo that it's the voters who really have to speak here. Just as they have spoken and elected Donald Trump president, they need to start electing people who believe that the law needs to be enforced, that criminals need to be dealt with. And particularly that violent criminals need to be incarcerated so they are incapacitated from committing more violence.
O'REILLY: So, that means mandatory sentencing. The judge giving somebody one year, a gang banger one year when they catch them with a glock. I mean, and that is what's happening in Cook County. That's crazy.
CUCCINELLI: Well, and that's Bill, if I could jump in --
O'REILLY: Sure.
CUCCINELLI: Richmond was, per capita, the murder capital of America 25 years ago. And just what you two are talking about was implemented on the partnership between state and federal prosecutors using federal mandatory minimums and relying on the old 80-20 rule. Eighty percent of your crime is committed by 20 percent of your criminals. You go after those folks who are using the guns, who are killing people and you put them away and you get disproportionate --
O'REILLY: Would you say ten years if you are convicted of carrying an illegal gun would be an inhibitor for this gang people?
CUCCINELLI: Well, whether it would inhibit them from doing it in the first place, once you've caught them and --
O'REILLY: You want to do both. You want to punish and inhibit. Finally in San Francisco --
TERWILLIGER: Bill, I have to --
O'REILLY: Go ahead.
TERWILLIGER: Thank you. I have to thank Ken because when I was deputy attorney general, we designed and implemented that program called trigger lock. And it worked.
O'REILLY: It works! I know.
TERWILLIGER: Because it targeted the most violent. So, when you ask a question about Chicago, one of the things that the federal authorities can do in Chicago, and I hope will do in the Trump administration, is come in there and work with the state and local police to identify those people who need to be hauled into federal court and prosecuted.
O'REILLY: It's never going to happen under Rahm Emanuel or Governor Rauner -- Republican. I mean, those guys are disgraceful, what's happening in that state --
CUCCINELLI: They can bypass that. What George is talking about is they can bypass that at the federal level if they have to.
O'REILLY: Okay. Gentlemen, and we will get to San Francisco in more in- depth soon.
Next on the rundown, the state of Maine cracking down on food stamp distribution. We will tell you how that's working out. And then later, Miller has some New Year's resolutions that he will impart up ahead.
O'REILLY: ""Impact Segment"" tonight. Government welfare. Today, Vice President-elect Pence scorched ObamaCare promising it will be repealed and replaced with a Republican health insurance program as yet undefined. We'll get to that in a moment. But over the country, states are getting hammered by giving entitlements, assistance to Americans across the fortune. And Maine is a good example. The fall of 2014, more than 13,000 Mainers, healthy adults without children were receiving food stamps.
But once the state law was passed that says in order to get free food you had to work. The number dropped to 2700 in three months. Thirteen thousand to 2700 with work required.
Joining us now here in New York City, Eric Bolling and Geraldo Rivera. So, this tells you, it has to tell you Geraldo, even you.
(LAUGHTER)
GERALDO RIVERA, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT AT LARGE: Even me.
O'REILLY: That the majority of people on the food stamps don't really need it, okay? And once required to do some work for the free food, they don't want it.
RIVERA: Well, I disagree with your characterization that the majority of people on food stamps don't need it.
O'REILLY: The main thing that's improved that to you.
RIVERA: I think that the majority of able-bodied --
O'REILLY: Well, that's what we're talking.
RIVERA: -- adults between 18 and 50 years old, they don't need it. And I am all for work-fare. I think Bill Clinton, 1996 along with Newt Gingrich, they were on the right track. I think Governor LePage up in Maine is on the right track. I don't think that entitlements do any good. So, right now they require, you can't have more than three months of food stamp assistance in three years. I think that's a good plan.
O'REILLY: In Maine.
RIVERA: In Maine.
O'REILLY: Able-bodied adults. Not children.
RIVERA: You can't minimize the impact of drug abuse. Maine has this terrible heroin epidemic. Most of the young adults are also a drug --
O'REILLY: Then you have to go to rehab. What do you say Bolling?
ERIC BOLLING, FOX NEWS CO-HOST, ""THE FIVE"": I'm going to agree with Geraldo. The numbers are staggering across the country not just Maine. Look at the numbers on food assistance. Snap program. When President Obama took office, there were about 30 million, maybe 32 million people on food assistance. It skyrocketed to 47. Now, Obama will take the victory lap on the academy getting better, unemployment rate going down, stock market going up. Home values going up. But the numbers of people coming off the food stamps isn't coming down at the same rate. It is bleeping down. Forty four million from 47. Meanwhile, half the amount of people --
O'REILLY: But if you impose the work fare rule on the able-bodied adults that would come down from 45 million --
(CROSSTALK)
RIVERA: But you also have to know that many of the people get those little cards. They go to the merchant, they say it's a $100 card. Give me $50 in cash.
BOLLING: Sure.
O'REILLY: Yes. And then they buy the drugs.
(CROSSTALK)
Okay. All right. Now, today, big dog and pony show in Washington. Vice President-elect Pence basically scorching ObamaCare. Roll the tape.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
MIKE PENCE (R), VICE PRESIDENT-ELECT: ObamaCare has failed. The promises of ObamaCare have all been proven to be false. The first order of business today for the President-elect, and I'm grateful for the leaders of the House and the Senate, is to keep our word to the American people. To repeal and replace ObamaCare. With health care reforms that, again, will focus on lowering the cost of health insurance without growing the size of government.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
O'REILLY: Okay. So, we don't have a Republican specific plan yet. We don't know exactly. I mean, Trump has said on the campaign trail he's going to keep the pre-existing conditions, that you can't deny anybody. And he's going to keep the kids getting insurance in their mom's home until they are 26 or something. But for you, the biggest failure of ObamaCare is what?
BOLLING: That every civil promise it made failed miserably.
O'REILLY: Give me one.
BOLLING: The cost, okay, they promise that premiums would come down $2500.
O'REILLY: And for most Americans they've gone up.
BOLLING: They've gone up by the amount they promise it was going to go down and they're playing games, Bill. They keep saying, well, look, the rate of increase has slowed. In other words, it's still going up but it's going up at a slower --
O'REILLY: Deductibles and the combination.
BOLLING: They're throwing it into the deductible side of the equation. So, if the premiums are still going up but going up at a lower rate, then deductibles are skyrocketing. Going from one to 2,000 per family to 10,000.
O'REILLY: It depends on what state you are in.
BOLLING: And we keep the premiums down. That's where they play with the - -
O'REILLY: The poling says most Americans Rivera don't want ObamaCare, they don't like it. Okay? And it's because of the cost. It just cost working people too much money. The trade-off was giving free medical care to again, coming right back to drug addicts, people can't make a living. They get ObamaCare free. But the working people pay for it.
RIVERA: Right. I think that in a way, that is as it should be, first of all.
O'REILLY: What is it, it should be?
RIVERA: That it should be means tested. If you are too poor to afford your insurance cover than the government should help you. I believe, let me give you my prejudice. First of all, I credit Bolling. I think that he was the first that I heard on interstate that insurance should be sold interstate, not intrastate. That I think that is b.s. and a function of state lobbying. So, I credit Bolling with that. Secondly, I am a believer and medicate for everybody. I wanted socialized medicine.
Republicans now are squawking about ObamaCare. They squawked about Social Security. They said it was compared -- they compared it to slavery. They squawked about Medicaid or Medicare.
O'REILLY: They don't want the government Rivera --
RIVERA: Giving free beer and free vacations. I think that you got 30 million people now getting insurance they didn't and the Republicans who say that --
O'REILLY: But you think that working-class families --
RIVERA: Repeal it for what? Repeal it for what?
O'REILLY: Hold it. But what it comes down to, when you strip way all of the -- that you want working-class families making 60,000 to 120,000 to pay for the other people's insurance. That's what you want.
RIVERA: If you've got a person impoverished, there is real property out there. I mean, we can't --
O'REILLY: There have to be safety nets.
RIVERA: President-elect Donald Trump has said he wants every American to be covered. I trust him when he says that.
O'REILLY: There's a difference between safety nets and the imposition of income redistribution. I'll give you the last word.
BOLLING: This is Medicaid on steroids. It is what it is. And you are 100 percent right. I don't think the number is 30. I think the number is somewhere around 15 million additional and the vast majority of them are either getting fully paid for.
O'REILLY: Right. Subsidized.
BOLLING: Highly subsidized.
O'REILLY: And that's why everybody else's payments are going up.
All right. So, it's a philosophical thing. There is no question.
Gentlemen, thank you for the good debate. Directly ahead, a new report about sanctuary cities that may anger you. Then, did you know child prostitution now is legal in California? Did you know that? Shocking report coming up.
O'REILLY: FACTOR ""Follow-Up"" segment tonight. New report on sanctuary cities according to the Department of Homeland Security. In the year 2015, there were 395 jurisdictions in this country that wouldn't cooperate with the federal government on illegal immigration matters. In 2016, that number dropped to 279, still a big number. But nearly 2,000 illegal immigrants were shielded by these outlaw sanctuary cities.
In fact, 1970 of the undocumented people detained were actually let go. All of them -- all of them convicted criminals. With us now here in New York City, Trish Regan and Eboni Williams.
So, it looks like California is going to fight Trump on the sanctuary cities. They've hired our pal Eric Holder, former Attorney General who wouldn't enforce federal law. I love this guy.
Miller, who is coming up, calls him Steadman. Because he looks like Oprah's boyfriend.
EBONI WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Okay.
O'REILLY: He does. He looks exactly like --
WILLIAMS: Bad looking guy.
O'REILLY: Right.
WILLIAMS: Okay.
O'REILLY: So, anyway, California has hired him and his law firm to fight the Trump administration on sanctuary cities. Who do you think is going to win?
WILLIAMS: They are getting ready for battle, Bill. I don't have my crystal ball but I can tell you that the law is actually on the side of the Trump administration. To be exact, it's article eight, U.S. code 1324. That really actually talks very exquisitely about the fact that you really can't do this. Now, people do do it. They hired Eric Holder, California did because they couldn't be more clear where they are ideologically on this issue.
O'REILLY: Right. So, the taxpayers of California --
WILLIAMS: Yes.
O'REILLY: -- are going to be paying Holder. And you know he's going to be charging big bucks. He's a lobbyist now. And his law firm to try to block --
WILLIAMS: To make very strong arguments.
O'REILLY: Anything that the Trump administration does --
WILLIAMS: Talk about jurisdiction Bill --
(CROSSTALK)
And anything like that.
O'REILLY: All right. What about the social deal, Trish? I mean, we have covered the Steinle family extensively here, okay? Illegal alien harbored by the county of San Francisco, deported seven times. Comes back and shoots this young woman to death. She's 33 years old. Okay. All over the country we see this.
TRISH REGAN, FBN HOST, ""THE INTELLIGENCE REPORT"": Uh-hm.
WILLIAMS: All right? We see this criminal aliens defined deportation coming in and killing Americans. More than 1900 last year were allowed to go free by sanctuary cities. These are convicted criminals. How do you process that?
REGAN: It doesn't make any sense. Right? Because common sense would tell you I don't want someone in my town that has committed these crimes. I'm not going to enable them and leave them.
O'REILLY: But they do. These cities do.
REGAN: And you know why, because it all comes down to politics, Bill. The left is working aggressively to bring us many immigrant voters into the population if they possibly can. And this is one way to do it. They don't even know what Trump is going to do.
O'REILLY: There's a strict line in Homeland Security stats between gardeners and maids and law-abiding people who are here with undocumented status. And the criminals. We are talking about the criminals here.
REGAN: It's the narrative. Right? They are trying to see the narrative that Trump is going to be anti-immigrants.
O'REILLY: Right.
REGAN: So, they're trying to --
O'REILLY: This has been going on long before Trump. Long before Trump.
REGAN: Now they have a chance to really work it. And I think that's what you're saying.
WILLIAMS: And I do think President-elect Trump has ran on the promise that he will be the enforcer of these laws.
O'REILLY: Yes.
WILLIAMS: Like sanctuary cities, like you. And actually, I don't like them either. I want to be clear about that. I am a person of the law. I feel like the federal law deports criminals for a reason. I've seen them. I have had clients. I've represented them and said, you know what? You've got to go to ICE because you are convicted. And that is how it goes in this country. But I will say this. If I'm a progressive person, I have these, you know, reasons that I want to say that it's a broken immigration system and these people shouldn't be victims. But that argument doesn't flash Bill because what we are seeing is an increase of crime, of violent crime in these scenarios.
O'REILLY: Here is what I don't understand.
WILLIAMS: That can't happen.
O'REILLY: The Obama administration deported a lot of people, a lot of undocumented aliens. They've deported it, okay? Mostly at the border, mostly a turnaround situation. And everyone they turned around was counted as a deportees. So, the President can say, hey, don't tell me I'm lax on immigration. I deported this many people. However, they looked totally the other way for eight years and now this should be embarrassing to President Obama. His Attorney General for six years is now signed on to help sanctuary cities. Should be embarrassed.
REGAN: Well, and it's amazing that you see Rahm Emanuel for example come out and say, I will do everything in my power to defend these people. You're seeing this in California.
O'REILLY: People shot dead in the street in record numbers.
REGAN: So, no common sense here. But there is an overall political narrative I think that they are trying to get it.
O'REILLY: And you can never win that argument.
WILLIAMS: Final point about Eric Holder's -- sorry Bill, is I like him in this role because I think that he was playing politics at the AG, which I didn't like, Bill.
O'REILLY: Of course he was.
WILLIAMS: I think this is a proper suiting of his temperament. He likes to do this political --
REGAN: But it is still a continuation of politics. Right? I mean --
WILLIAMS: At least it's better played here.
O'REILLY: Here's the deal. Jeff Sessions is going to be Attorney General and he despises Steadman. I mean Eric Holder.
(LAUGHTER)
He hates him.
And this is what makes it interesting. So, Sessions, the Alabama, all right? Is going to get in there and he's going to go up against Steadman, all right, in California. Mano o mano. It's personal. All right? And we will follow the story for you guys. All right? And how this all works out. Because Trump has got to go in with a hammer on sanctuary cities. Last word, Trish.
REGAN: He's got leverage. He's got leverage because it's money. At the end of the day, you know --
O'REILLY: No, end of the day --
REGAN: Ten percent of San Francisco's budget comes from the federal government.
O'REILLY: Okay. End of the day. Got to find him 25 bucks for IndependenceFund.org. Okay? We're ended the days. We're going to carry that rule over for 2017.
Ladies, thank you very much. More ahead. As FACTOR moves along this evening, aggressive teenagers now confronting police. Things are getting very nasty. Martha MacCallum is investigating.
Also Miller with his New Year's Eve -- New Year's resolutions I should say. And a new law about emails. We hope you stay tuned for those reports.
O'REILLY: ""Unresolved Problems"" segment tonight. Protecting young Americans. In California, Governor Jerry Brown signed a law decriminalizing prostitution for minors. Those under 18. I did not know that. That means that California authorities will not arrest teenage prostitutes. Because the California legislature believes they are victims, not criminals.
Joining us now from Sacramento, Travis Allen, a Republican California assemblyman. So right now on the streets of LA, San Francisco, San Diego, kids 12, 13 can sell themselves to adults and the cops aren't going to do anything about it. Is that correct?
TRAVIS ALLEN (R), CALIFORNIA ASSEMBLYMAN: That is actually -- absolutely correct, Bill. And, you know, as a legislator, I saw this on the assembly floor. I voted against it. But, you know, and I thought this is a terrible law. That we see all kinds of bad laws here in California.
O'REILLY: But this is travesty though. This is shocking. This law is shocking. And I understand it's because the liberal legislature in Sacramento says, well, we can't punish these children and give them a criminal record or anything like that because it's not their fault. That's the mentality, right?
ALLEN: Yes. Look, you know, the California Democrats might have good intentions with legalizing child prostitution but there is absolutely no way that this will have good consequences.
O'REILLY: You can understand the victimization. I can anyway. Do you understand it? That if you are 12, 13, 14 year old, that screwed up, maybe, if you've been abused yourself by your parents or whoever. And now you're out on the street and you don't want to do. You have to feel sorry for those kids. That's why they have covenant house and these charities. You understand that, right?
ALLEN: Oh, absolutely. Look, you know, we want to fix the problem. The difficulty is those legalizing child prostitution absolutely can't be the answer.
O'REILLY: It isn't the answer because now it's much easier for the pimps, the people who run these kids to operate because the way that the pimps were caught was that the children would testify against them. Now the kids can't testify against anything because they are not even taken into the police station.
ALLEN: That is exactly right. The district attorneys are up in arms about this. This takes away the ability for them to use a plea bargain to go after the pimps and now the pimps will say to the minors, look, if you get approached by a cop on the street corner, just tell them to basically go away and it's violating your constitutional rights and there is nothing that that cop can do.
O'REILLY: Has there been any outrage among the people of California? I know it's a progressive state and all of this but I mean, I am just stunned here. How about the church groups and civic groups and the child protection people? Have there been any organized outrage about this?
ALLEN: So, when the law passed, you know, it kind of -- and not many people notice. It wasn't -- I was reading --
O'REILLY: I didn't know about it. Yes.
ALLEN: That's it. I was reading an article of all the new laws that are coming in. And these were laws that I'd see, and seeing it again in print, you know, I'm an ordinary Californian myself -- I just thought, wow, this is heinous. And so, I wrote an op-ed in the Washington Examiner because I had to let everybody know not only in California but across the country. This is what the California Democrats are up to.
O'REILLY: Did Jerry Brown, the governor of your state, say anything? Has he mentioned this at all in the public arena?
ALLEN: To the best of my knowledge, they are trying to sweep this under the rug and then they are trying to claim that, you know, any minor is a victim so we don't want to give them a criminal record. The problem is they are entirely missing the point which is by not allowing us to put them in a secure facility away from their pens, off the street, we can't get them the sort of rehabilitative services that they need.
O'REILLY: Right. They have to go voluntarily which is, if they are being coerced by an adult, him, they're not going to do. I mean, who is looking out for these kids? By using a theory of victimization which again I understand the theory. Okay? You are putting the children in more danger, catastrophic danger. If you are a child prostitute, you're going to get all kinds of disease. You're probably going to get addicted to drugs. You're going to get beaten up. You're going to get the base. And by the time you're 16, you are through. And it doesn't seem like the liberal politicians of California care one bit. Last word.
ALLEN: It's absolutely heartless. This is an unbelievable law. It's a law that has to be overturned. The California Democrats did just legalize child prostitution in California, and the people of California, the people of the United States, you've got to let them know how you feel and we've got to overturn this law.
O'REILLY: All right. We appreciated it, Mr. Allen. Thank you and good luck. And let us know how it goes. Miller is on deck. He has some resolutions in an email situation that will get your attention. The D-man is next.
O'REILLY: Thanks for staying with us. I'm Bill O'Reilly in the ""Miller Time"" segment tonight. Let's get right to the sage of Southern California who joins us from Santa Barbara.
All right. Miller, lay a few resolutions on us for the New Year.
DENNIS MILLER, COMEDIAN: Sorry, I had a check over my shoulder. I wanted to make sure I didn't have a bridge coming out of my head like the guy in Sacramento did.
(LAUGHTER)
New Year's resolutions, Billy. Let's see. I wrote a few down here. Number one, and most importantly, I must not accidentally go into the hair salon that Representative Patty Murray uses. That's number one right there. Number two --
(LAUGHTER)
O'REILLY: A lot of people don't know what Patty Murray's hair looks like.
MILLER: It looks like the owner of the Oakland Raiders. Secondly, when I emailed my good friend Hillary Clinton now, I am just going to cc Putin so I can eliminate the middleman. That is another thing I am going to do this year. Third, and Eric Bolling reminded me of this. I'm going to work on something to replace the phrase, on steroids. Because I am so sick of that. We use it every day. It is getting so mindless. It's like short people, tall people, just short people on steroids. Okay. I get it. I get it.
O'REILLY: It's like ""at the end of the day"" and it's like, ""what do you make of that?"" This resolution, we are not saying, what do you make of that on THE FACTOR in 2017. Go ahead, you are smoking, Miller. Go ahead.
MILLER: All right. The next one. I'm going to get in shape and I am going to go on the Gerard Depardieu diet, you don't lose any weight. It's just -- you take your shirt off and everybody looks away so you might as well be thin because nobody looks at you.
Next up, I'm going to lay low, Bill, because when you were talking at the beginning about the tale of two cities, I was watching the news today and there are two countries now. You know that? I think you talked about this and that book ages ago about the culture war.
O'REILLY: Yes.
MILLER: But there really are two countries right now.
O'REILLY: Yes.
MILLER: When I looked at the Schumer step up with that stupid ""Make America Sick Again."" And by the way, that can also stand for ""Make a Stupid Acronym"" if you want to do it that way. And people are behind him nodding and agreeing with that. When I see us getting guys out of Gitmo, it seems like the President is in a hurry to get maybe 19 more I heard Katherine Harris say before he leaves and half the country thinks that good and half the country is going, why are we in a rush? We have a tale of two countries. And as they said in the book, it was the best of times. It was the worst of times.
O'REILLY: Yes. There is no doubt. We will visit both parts, both countries. And now in France, you like France. You go there once in a while, right? And hang out?
MILLER: Yes. I do.
O'REILLY: Okay.
MILLER: I just spent the holidays with two of my dearest friends in the world who are from Paris.
O'REILLY: Okay. So, there's a new law that if you have a company in France with more than 50 employees, you have to negotiate with your employees about when you can email them, Miller. Because the French don't want to be annoyed after work. I like this. What do you say?
MILLER: Well, I kind of -- I get it, Bill. You know, like in America, I don't think it would play because, you know, there's always -- there's always a hustler who wants to get ahead and will take the emails after work.
O'REILLY: Yes.
MILLER: You know, in France, it's not really like that. They want to, you know, what is the old saying about they don't live to work? They work to live.
O'REILLY: I want a croissant and I'm not going to be interrupted. I want that croissant now.
MILLER: So, I think for them, it makes sense. Because they get off work and they just want to put a bearnaise drip in their arm.
(LAUGHTER)
O'REILLY: All right. So, Miller and I are on the same page. That's another cliche. On the same page. But we will not use -- well, at the end of the day, we will not use ""on steroids"" and we will not use, what do you make of that?
MILLER: Bill, the word but is like the word however on steroids.
O'REILLY: Dennis Miller, everybody. A quick reminder, nine days, the D- man, me, Watters, you are rolling into Tulsa, Oklahoma. The Spin Stops here shows. Should be a blast. Few tickets also for the shows in Omaha and Tacoma remain. Details at BillO'Reilly.com.
Martha MacCallum on deck. American teenagers getting more violent. Write back with it.
O'REILLY: ""Back in the Book"" segment tonight. Did you see that? Aggressive teenagers. The first in Philadelphia.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Take a look at this part of the video which shows the Philadelphia police officer and a girl going at it in the middle of the street. The officer on top of the girl, punching her over and over.
RICHARD ROSS, PHILADELPHIA POLICE COMMISSIONER: The one thing that is not depicted in the video that the female indicated that she did was smack the officer in the face and knocked her glasses off.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
O'REILLY: Also in North Carolina, there was this.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
This morning, 15-year-old Jasmine Darwin, the high school student being slammed to the ground by a school resource officer in this video, is speaking out.
JASMINE DARWIN, LOUISVILLE, NC HIGH SCHOOL STUDENT: When I watch the video, I get really angry. Like you did not have to slam me like that. You could have just pulled me away.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
O'REILLY: Here now to explain further, FOX News anchor Martha MacCallum. There is always more to these things. Let's take North Carolina first. Fifteen-year-old girl gets slammed to the ground, the video is pretty explicit. What did she do?
MARTHA MACCALLUM, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: It was a rough video. She was apparently trying to break up a fight that her sister was in at school. She tried to pull the two people apart and the person came in, grabbed her and slammed her on the ground.
O'REILLY: The person is a security guard?
MACCALLUM: He is a police officer who was on the scene, a guard at the school.
O'REILLY: Right.
MACCALLUM: And both of these cases the police officer that you see in the video has been put on leave, administrative leave while they continue this investigation. The story of this young girl is apparently an honor student. She wasn't really involved in the fight but, you know, things got out of control and that's what see happening in so many situations.
O'REILLY: All right. But I want to just stay on North Carolina thing.
MACCALLUM: Okay.
O'REILLY: So, this girl here, it looks like from our investigation and reports, really didn't deserve this kind of treatment.
MACCALLUM: Apparently not.
O'REILLY: Okay.
MACCALLUM: There was a fight. Her sister was involved. She tried to intervene and in the melee, this is what happened.
O'REILLY: Right. This is what happened. Okay. We don't want to try it on TV but we do have to report the facts. In Philadelphia, it's a different story. Right?
MACCALLUM: Different story. Right. In this the story, the video we just showed you, the young woman admitted in their police report that she slapped the cop.
O'REILLY: She's a woman cop. Right?
MACCALLUM: Yes. A brawl going on in the street. The police come into straighten things out. And in this case, you know, the police officer and this young woman get into it. They are punching each other, going at each other. Both sides admitted that they punched and slapped the other. The young woman apparently started it, and slapped the police officer first. But, you know, there is absolutely no sort of understanding of authority. When the police officers come in and tell everyone to calm down, it's like there's --
O'REILLY: Yes. And we don't know what the girl is saying to the officer. And if the girl had slapped the officer beforehand, obviously the officer is not going to be real happy about that. What has happened here in this case?
MACCALLUM: So, the officer is also on leave, paid leave while they investigate what happened.
O'REILLY: Right.
MACCALLUM: There are no charges that are being filed against this young women even though she admitted to the police that she reached out and slapped the police officer.
O'REILLY: Well, if she slapped the police officer, they have to charge her.
MACCALLUM: They're not. Right now they are not.
O'REILLY: The Philly D.A. has just not going to charge her.
MACCALLUM: She's not going to charge her.
O'REILLY: He's got to explain that. Has he said anything about it?
MACCALLUM: You know, it may be because he feels that the police officer then overdid it.
O'REILLY: But that doesn't matter though.
MACCALLUM: Agreed.
O'REILLY: You charge them both.
MACCALLUM: But whatever reason, or maybe it's because they deal with these kinds of situations so often these days. I mean, out of control. Look at what's going on in the malls over Christmas.
O'REILLY: Sure. These kids invading malls and --
MACCALLUM: It's very distracting when you watch this --
O'REILLY: Right.
MACCALLUM: You know, you pull them up and suddenly there are 17 others that are just like it.
O'REILLY: And this is all in social media and that's what's encouraging --
MACCALLUM: Yes. Exactly.
O'REILLY: All right. You are a Jersey girl.
MACCALLUM: I am a Jersey girl.
O'REILLY: Bruce Springsteen, big fan?
MACCALLUM: Yes. Sure, since high school, I've been going to Bruce Springsteen concerts.
O'REILLY: Really?
MACCALLUM: I think around the Bush years, he started to get increasingly political.
O'REILLY: All right. So, let's listen to his latest. Roll the tape.
MACCALLUM: Okay.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN, SINGER: I felt disgust before but never the kind of fear that you feel now.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Right.
SPRINGSTEEN: It's as simple as the fear of is someone simply competent enough to do this particular job?
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Right.
SPRINGSTEEN: Forget about where they are ideologically.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Right.
SPRINGSTEEN: Do they simply have the pure competence to be put in the position of such, you know, the responsibility?
(END VIDEO CLIP)
O'REILLY: That's not terrible. I mean, he doesn't like conservatives. I think he's a very far left guy, Springsteen.
MACCALLUM: Yes.
O'REILLY: But he is just questioning whether the President is going to be able to do the job.
MACCALLUM: It's fascinating. Because he called Donald Trump a moron. He said he was a threat to democracy during the course of the election season. But then he sort of concede. He said, well, I understand why people would vote for him. Because they are concerned about jobs and they're concerned about ISIS. He said I'm sure there are plenty of good people out there who voted for Donald Trump. And I just find those concessions interesting in light of his other comments. Because he's obviously acknowledging, you know, this is a guy who's been championing the working class.
O'REILLY: Yes. I mean, almost the same -- but you say that when Bush the younger was elected, then Springsteen started to go left publicly. All right?
MACCALLUM: Yes. I'm not sure why some of these people feel like their artistic talent gives them license. Start spouting on stage but if for one don't really care what they think about these things when they're there to see a concert. But they feel strongly.
O'REILLY: Yes.
MACCALLUM: Bruce Springsteen clearly feels strongly that it's his obligation to get out there and tell people how he feels about it.
O'REILLY: I guess. All right. His concert is like eight hours long.
MACCALLUM: It's long.
O'REILLY: Yes. So, you have to kind of bring a change of clothes.
MACCALLUM: And Bruce just keeps going on. I mean, he's in amazing shape and the guy can, you know --
O'REILLY: Yes. Well, all right. I have never been to a Springsteen concert.
MACCALLUM: Never.
O'REILLY: And I believe that will stay that way. Martha MacCallum, everybody. FACTOR ""Tip of the Day,"" why FOX News remains on top. ""The Tip"" moments away.
O'REILLY: FACTOR ""Tip of the Day,"" FOX News continuing to dominate the cable news landscape in a moment. But first the mail.
Tom Boone, Houston. ""Bill, your entire Talking Points Memo on the inauguration was speculation. I get a kick out of how you say you don't speculate. Nonsense.""
The fact is that talent for inauguration day is scant, and politics is the reason why.
Peter Chan, Los Angeles. ""I can attest that the Talking Points on the inauguration is right on the money. After Jackie Evancho announced she would sing, she was smeared on the net. The vitriol and vulgarity she received was terrible.""
Nancy O'Connor, Great Neck, New York. ""I agree with Charles Krauthammer that there have always been challenges for conservative entertainers. But in this case, it's worse. Hillary Clinton losing, there is the bitter taste of sour grapes.""
Val Sanchez, Albuquerque, New Mexico. ""Some artists are afraid, some just refused to help unite the country.""
I can tell you guys this. In the case of the blind tenor, Andrea Bocelli, the man has been threatened with career damage if he performs at the inauguration. A very reliable source told me that just hours ago. I usually don't go with anonymous sources but I believe what I've been told.
Maritha Jeffrey, Riverside, California. ""Bill, when you said, respect the process of the election and stop the nonsense. I believe many are plotted in their living rooms.""
Joe Hardy, Hilliard, Ohio. ""Bill, I need further clarification on what you said about Social Security in the Tip of the Day. I am 72 and depend on that money to live on."" You're safe, Joe. But the Social Security system will have to be revamped soon. That means that the age people get Social Security is going to be raised and wealthy Americans will receive less.
When Congress finally revises the bankrupt program, it's bankrupt, it is likely that those under the age of 50 will be most affected.
Tony Marell, Santa Barbara, California. ""Bill, so Watters gets to debut with you and Miller in Tulsa on January 13. Does he also get to go to Omaha and Tacoma?""
Yes he does, Tony. Spin stops here show includes Watters all this year. Unless of course, he is suddenly incarcerated.
Janine Corthworth, Northridge, California. ""O'Reilly, you badger your guests and degrade them. Do you ever listen to anyone other than yourself?""
You know, Janine, I don't usually say this, because I want everyone to watch THE FACTOR. But this program might not be for you. We do robust debate here. Best argument wins. A lot of back and forth. PBS, right down the dial. They're happy.
Finally tonight, THE FACTOR ""Tip of the Day,"" if you believe in capitalism, you also believe that performance usually wins the competition. So it is here at the FOX News Channel. As we reported last night, FOX News dominated all cable channels. In 2016, not just news, we beat the zombies. We beat them bad. The reason is, both on and off the air, FNC staff is top-notch. Here's a good example. Tucker Carlson recently took over the 7 p.m. slot. His ratings have improved 71 percent in the demographic from November to November.
Carlson puts on a feisty direct program. Viewers notice. Hopefully in 2017, eventually we will continue its dominos. Of course, we compete in a free marketplace, and it's up to you to decide who is the winner. FACTOR ""Tip of the Day.""
That is it for us tonight. Please check out the FOX News FACTOR website different from BillO'Reilly.com.
Also, we'd like you to spout off about THE FACTOR from anywhere in the world. O'Reilly@FOXNews.com O'Reilly@FOXNews.com Name and town, name and town, name and town if you wish to opine. Word of the day, do not be arcane when writing to us.
Tomorrow, there is a group that is spending lots of money to try to undermine the Trump organization, the Trump administration. And they are serious, these people. They are really out there trying to do damage. So we are going to report on that. Name the names and have a lot of lead discussions as we always do.
Again, thanks for watching us tonight. I am Bill O'Reilly. Please remember that the spin stops here. We're definitely looking out for you."

Lame duck President Barack Obama attempted to salvage his political legacy today with a stop by the Capitol. His mission, fighting to repeal of his eponymous healthcare law.
Here's Democrats now to rescue Republicans when they try to pass replacement to it and to brand any new law as Trumpcare. Democrats seem to embrace that strategy. The stage is now set for yet another fiery healthcare debate.
Take a look at part of it.

MIKE PENCE, VICE PRESIDENT-ELECT OF THE UNITED STATES: Let the first order of business is to repeal and replace Obamacare.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We're here today to warn the American people that the Republican plan to cut Medicare, Medicaid, repeal the ACA will make America sick again.
REP. PAUL RYAN (R-WI), SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE: This law has failed. Americans are struggling. The law is failing while we speak. We need to reverse the damage that has been done.
REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA), HOUSE MINORITY LEADER: In this case, all politics is personal.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We are going to work hard everyday not just to repeal Obamacare, but to replace it with reforms that actually put patients back in charge of their health care decision.
PENCE: We're going to keep our promise to the American people and we are going to repeal Obamacare.
The only thing that has going for it is alliteration.
PELOSI: The Republicans say repeal and replace. The only thing that has going for it is alliteration.
(END VIDEOTAPE)
CARLSON: Congressman Jim Himes of Connecticut was in that meeting with President Obama and he joins us now from the Russell rotunda over at the Capitol.
Congressman, thanks a lot for joining us.
REP. JIM HIMES (D), CONNECTICUT: Hi, Tucker. How are you?
CARLSON: I'm great. So, I mean, just a macro question here, I understand that this is the president's signature achievement as president, has his name on it and there are probably some things about it that we can all agree are fine. But, basically, it's a flawed piece of legislation that the public has never fully embraced. Why are Democrats defending it as vigorously as they are?
HIMES: Well, you know, at some level it has nothing to do with the politics. I mean, you said the public has never embraced it and you are right. It's always sort of been 50/50 here and there.
CARLSON: That's right.
HIMES: But the fact of the matter is that when you talk about the various elements of it like you don't get turned away if you have a pre-existing condition.
CARLSON: Right.
HIMES: The fact that, you know, in my own state, the coverage rates have gone way, way up. The idea, 70 percent of Americans supporting the fact that your kids can stay on your insurance until you are 26, if you list the five or six things that are core to Obamacare, people love it.
The problem is, of course, for seven years they've been told it's evil as Obamacare and whatnot. So now the Republicans find themselves in a position of having to navigate that paradox.
CARLSON: Is that really your argument, that people don't love it because they've been lied to? I mean, people are experiencing Obamacare. And you have gotten it. The law has not gotten the cost under control. You've conceded that's your own constituents. Let us watched the tape of you admitting that.
That was the core of Obamacare. We're going to get healthcare cost under control and it didn't do it. So why don't you just admit that?
HIMES: So that wasn't the core promise of Obamacare. The core promise of Obamacare was that for the first time in a very long -- for the first time ever, the United States would have the ability to cover all of its people.
And I will reiterate what I've said. No one including under Obamacare has manage to get the cost of the industry under control the way we would like to. But at the end of the day, look, this isn't about who says what or who -- and yes, there was a lot of lying, but the fact of the matter is you've got 20 or 30 million Americans out there who have insurance that didn't have it before. You've got seniors who are paying less for their drugs.
So, you know, this idea that somehow this thing is a massive failure, that it's crumbling of its own weight is something that is a bumper sticker that most Americans -- and this will be the test. When most Americans, if there is a repeal and no replace, and they realize oh, my God, look at what just happened, they will be infuriated. And this of course -- that's why we're hearing from Rand Paul, you know, that if we can't do a repeal, we've got to talk about replace.
CARLSON: OK. I understand you've got a lot vested in this. You voted for it. I'm sure you agree with lots of parts of that. All of that is fine. But you are making a non-sensible argument. You are saying that the public loves Obamacare, but you are also conceding that they don't actually love Obamacare because it's never really gotten above 50 percent.
A law that transform the life of every person in this country does not have the majority of support nationally. That is itself a failure, isn't it? And by the way, why don't they love it if it's so great. I don't understand.
HIMES: Well, look, it's a very complicated thing. And part of the reason they don't love it is because the conservative right wing started out and you use the word lie. But they started out with death panels, OK.
There are going to be panels that decides whether grandma live or die, right? And every single moment in, you know, in states that if they had in fact expanded Medicaid, very poor states like Mississippi and Alabama, if they've expanded Medicaid, they would have much healthier populations. They didn't do that.
So there are people on those states who should have the benefit of it, who haven't experienced it, but I promise you this, Tucker -- and look, public perception goes here or there and it will move around. Or something as complicated as health care, it's not surprising that it's not up at 70 or 80 percent approval, but they have -- yes, they have been lied to. They were fooled about that death panels.
(CROSSTALK)
CARLSON: I mean, look, you are a smart guy. You are in business before you went to Congress. Do you really believe that because conservative Web sites criticize Obamacare or -- Sarah Palin use the term death panels -- that all these many years, after its passage, Americans are still ignoring their own best interests and saying they don't like it just because they believe Sarah Palin from seven years ago? I mean, you don't really believe that, do you.
One third of counties in America have only one insurance provider. That's not a win, is it?
HIMES: I'm not making the argument and I wouldn't make the argument. I've never made the argument that Obamacare was perfect. We are talking about a massively complicated thing here.
So, yes, there is some instability in the exchanges out there. There have been areas in small businesses and other areas where premiums have gone up more than we would have like.
But, look, you cannot argue with the fact that every senior on Medicare out there is now paying less for their drugs. That the donut hole is closing.
Again, 20 or 30 million Americans -- the number is 20 million of people now have coverage that don't. Those are facts that you -- look, we don't need to argue about this because if the Republicans repeal this thing without a replacement, you are going to see an uprising. You're going to see anger.
And we'll be talking, you know, two months from now about my God, what did they just do.
CARLSON: OK. So, in other words, it's on the Republicans now. And you maybe be right. I mean, Republicans now run everything or they will at the end of this month.
But you haven't, you're not telling the entire truth about the cost here. So the cost fall disproportionately on the young and healthy. Has it occurred to you that that is the poorest segment of our society? Look at any chart. The poorest people are the youngest. The richest people are the oldest.
HIMES: Right.
CARLSON: Obama shifts the cost from the young and the healthy, there's the chart right there to the old and the sick. It is the most regressive possible way to pay for anything and as a Democrat who believes in helping the needy, I'm surprised you would support something like that.
HIMES: Well, actually, I think you've got it exactly backward. As you know, the poor and the elderly are precisely the populations that are covered by Medicaid and Medicare respectively. Programs that are highly, highly popular.
(CROSSTALK)
CARLSON: Right. By the way, I guess another obvious question which is, those programs are very popular. You've never explained why Obamacare is not as popular as Medicare or Medicaid, but anyway, the truth is Obamacare is entering a debt spiral in a lot of states precisely because young people have decided it's not in their interest to sign up for it.
So that's just a very basic problem, but it's also revealing of the basic unfairness. The poorest people are paying for the richest people to get healthcare.
HIMES: Well, that's -- again, you are just dead wrong about that. The only people who are paying more under Obamacare are the people who have incomes over $250,000, who saw a little bit of an uptick on the Medicare payment that they have to make on their passive income, on their interest and their dividends. So you've got it exactly backwards.
But let's go back to young people because I think they are really core. OK, young people, you hate the mandate. The Republicans hate the mandate. I get that. I don't like the idea --
(CROSSTALK)
CARLSON: You hate the mandate?
HIMES: I don't like the idea that the government tells me what I have to do. But, look, the idea that a young person who immortal -- look, I was 23 once too, and I was immortal. But what happens when I get hit by a bus and I am not insured? You and I both know what happens, which is that you and I with health care plans pay for that immortal 23-year-old to get treated in a hospital.
So this idea -- the core of what people hate at the mandate is about personal responsibility.
(CROSSTALK)
CARLSON: It's about personal responsibility.
HIMES: It's about personal responsibility. You know what, that's a deeply with respect disingenuous thing for you to say.
CARLSON: As the father of a 22-year-old, I can tell you, my child will be happy to buy catastrophic care coverage for that incident you referred to and yet my kids have to buy -- we all do covers that includes pregnancy and maternity care -- breastfeeding coverage, birth control coverage.
Why can't my children who don't make much money buy catastrophic care coverage? The coverage they want, because they are subsidizing other people. That's why and you know that.
HIMES: OK. Well, let me answer that question with a question to you. Your 22-year-old who would like a catastrophic plan with no coverage for pregnancy or for breastfeeding, is it possible Tucker, that your 22-year- old might someday, I don't know if your 22-year-old is a man or a woman, but might have a child? Is that possible?
CARLSON: Probably unlikely that my son will have to pay for his breastfeeding, but look, my point is leaving aside my --
HIMES: That's disingenuous, Tucker. He may not have to breastfeed, but his wife will. Come on.
CARLSON: Please, look, your argument is that young people are not likely to get sick. True. But it's possible they will -- some sort of tragic will befall them and will be stuck with the cost. So why shouldn't they be able to buy insurance against that? And the answer is that a bunch of lobbyist here in D.C. where I live and I know how this works, got in there and said, no, cover the service I represent. Cover the company I represent.
This was a trough. A lot of people got rich on it and it shafted young people who don't have any money. As you know, it's why they're not buying cars, they're not buying houses, they are not getting married and part of the problem is Obamacare and you know that.
HIMES: You know what, Tucker, what I know is two things. I know and you should know how the insurance industry works. I have never had a car accident in my 30 some years of driving and yet I pay my car insurance premiums.
Maybe I shouldn't pay for insurance because I don't have car accidents. So your argument is actually disingenuous.
Number two, young people, you are saying --
(CROSSTALK)
CARLSON: No, it's not.
HIMES: Well, they don't have the money to do it. As you know, if they don't have the money to do it, they get subsidies, they get subsidies to help them by plans. That's a big part of Obamacare.
CARLSON: But why can't they just buy catastrophic plans that suit their needs? Because they are subsidizing other people who lobby you and every other member of Congress, all the Democrats with money to include all this stuff that they don't need and you know that's true.
HIMES: Well, how about this. Let's agree on this. So you said your 22- year-old son should not have to pay maternity care or for the possibility that he may choose to have a child someday.
How about if I introduce an amendment that says we will cut his premium if he signs a paper that says I will never have children? What do you think about that?
CARLSON: Yes. I think that's the kind of solution that you may come up with, actually. The government telling you how many kids you can have and under what circumstances.
HIMES: Oh, yes, yes, that's where we're going, Tucker.
(CROSSTALK)
CARLSON: How about this, you can do what you want. You might not benefit, I can tell.
(CROSSTALK)
HIMES: That's where we're going.
(CROSSTALK)
CARLSON: Congressman, thanks a lot for -- thanks for your game attempt. I appreciate it. Good to see you.
HIMES: All right. Thanks, Tucker.
CARLSON: Well, President-elect Donald Trump spent the day in New York City and that amazingly is also our correspondent Peter Doocy spent his day. He is live outside Trump Tower tonight.
Hey, Peter.
PETER DOOCY, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Hey, Tucker. The head of the intelligence agency that the president-elect says he does not blindly trust are on their way here to Trump Tower for a briefing on Friday. America's top spies are going to bring the evidence they have that makes them so sure it was Russia and not somebody else meddling with the U.S. electoral process and some of the names on the guest list for this briefing on Friday include director of National Intelligence James Clapper, CIA director John Brennan and FBI director James Comey, who many Democrats accuse of interfering in the election themselves for making an official update on the Clinton email case just days before people headed to the polls.
These officials were announced as briefers even after the president-elect wrote this online, quote, ""The intelligence briefing on so-called Russian hacking was delayed until Friday. Perhaps more time needed to build a case. Very strange.""
And that's not the only thing that should make Friday's briefing very interesting.
There is this, too. Julian -- from Mr. Trump's Twitter account -- ""Julian Assange said a 14-year-old could have hacked Podesta. Why was DNC so careless? Also said Russians did not give him the info.""
Well, that's all happening down in D.C. We saw one key member of the Trump team already scoping out the west wing today. That is soon-to-be councillor to the president Kellyanne Conway, spotted by our crew walking into the west wing for a meeting with Valerie Jarrett.
Remember, Valerie Jarrett called the result of the November election soul crushing. And Conway obviously would have something to do with that, because she was the last campaign manager. But Conway told our producer there at the White House that so far the long-time Obama aid Jarrett has been gracious during the transition.
Tucker?
CARLSON: Peter Doocy, live outside Trump Tower in New York.
Thanks a lot Peter.
Well, a group of House Republicans came in for some embarrassment yesterday when they tried and failed to gut an independent ethics office. Donald Trump killed that effort in less than a day with two well-armed shots with .60 caliber Twitter rifle.
""Fox News"" senior political analyst Brit Hume joins us now to explain exactly what happened.
Brit, it's great to see you.
So all the coverage, as you know, has been hostile to this group of Republicans attempting to do away with an ethics oversight board in effect. There's another side to this story. You are in Washington for so long. What is the other side of the story?
BRIT HUME, FOX NEWS SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST: The other side of the story is that this oversight ethics board really didn't mounted very much at all in the first place. The only official power it really had, Tucker, and it had no subpoena power so its investigation to the extent there were investigations were highly limited was to make recommendations to the House Ethics Committee, which remains in place.
They did, however, have the ability to receive anonymous tips, investigate them in whatever way it could, and then publish them. So that what you had was sort of half finished, half baked investigative material being released. A material that might or might not even be the subject of a recommendation to the House Ethics Committee.
And this was an operation, I think, that is fair to say was in bad need of reform because the potential for incomplete investigations was very real and the potential for views and the release of these materials was very real as well.
And gutting is a sort of useless word to apply to announce that it really never had any official power to begin with.
CARLSON: It does sound like some sort of justice panel on a college campus. But I did wonder, it's just a matter of appearances, if you are coming in to a new Congress, the 115th and your first order of business appears to be making the ethics rules later on yourself, that was the appearance anyway, probably an unwise thing?
HUME: Right. In political terms, it was, it was ridiculously poorly timed, clumsy, and in the end, of course, ineffectual. So now we still have this weird, sort of unelected body of people who advise the House Ethics Committee and it's still there. And they're going to try to take this on later in the year having stumbled in the effort to reform it to begin with, which is regrettable all the way around.
It was very badly handled. There's no question about that. And, of course, the Trumpet tweet which got everyone talking about it had a lot to do, I think, with the outcome.
I mean, the public was alarmed to hear this.
CARLSON: Right.
HUME: And, of course, all the reporting that, you know, that this watchdog body, which everybody suddenly imagined they met although they may never heard of it, was very important and very useful. Although, you know, Tucker, you've got to ask yourself this question. How much of either of us ever really heard about anything of a consequence of this outfit did before the day before yesterday.
And I think the answer probably in both our cases is not very much.
(CROSSTALK)
And, nonetheless, it became a big story --
(CROSSTALK)
It certainly does. And, look, of course it looked terrible that it was made to appear that they were doing something really, you know, in the dead of night. They were trying to gut the ethics watchdog which is kind of a ridiculous exaggeration.
CARLSON: So I had lunch here today with a lobbyist in Washington. The lunch options here are limited here, as you know, so you do wind up a lunch with lobbyist. And I asked him what is the Congress -- what do members think of Trump? And the first thing he said was, this was two weeks ago, he said they are terrified of his Twitter account.
That he could marshal all this public attention on them. That they are afraid to run afoul with that. Is that why and it's clearly true, we see it from this, is that why he is keeping his Twitter account, do you think?
HUME: I would think so. And, you know, you can say what you will about the tone and even the substance of many of his tweets, but it's beyond argument that the use of the Twitter account has not been effective for him.
And if you look at the upcoming legislative battles that are ongoing, it will be important for Trump to do a couple of things and one of them will be to keep, obviously, the Republicans in line in House and Senate. It will be harder in the Senate perhaps. It always seems to be. And, of course, the margin there is much narrower for the Republicans.
And it will also be important for him to be able to successfully pressure Democrats, who they will need for say, to break a filibuster on a Supreme Court nomination. So he's got this, he's got this dartboard that he's got called Twitter and he can aim these little missiles at various members and take them on.
Now it doesn't mean he will win the argument, but it means that he has the power to start the argument and to call attention to all kinds of things.
CARLSON: Yes.
HUME: So I think it's interesting that they are afraid of his Twitter account and I think they have a right to be.
CARLSON: Yes, I think that's right. At least we got to see his work with Boeing.
Brit Hume who knows more about government and politics than anybody I have ever met. A walking encyclopedia. Thank you, Brit. It's great to see you.
HUME: Thank you. Thank you, Tucker. I'm still barely walking.
(LAUGHTER)
CARLSON: Time now for our ""Twitter Storm."" It's our nightly forecast of social media's most intense weather pattern. Tonight, a dark cloud of ignorance and elitism of some over Hollywood. That's always the forecast there, by the way.
A group called Humanity for Progress, formerly called Humanity for Hillary during the campaign released a video featuring a number of celebrities and semi celebrities begging Congress to obstruct President-elect Trump's agenda, all of it.
Here's part of the video.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We need you.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: And we expect you to have our backs.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: To protect our civil liberties.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And to use your congressional powers --
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: To obstruct.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: To obstruct.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Obstruct.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Obstruct.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Defeat.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Anything.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Anything.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Anything.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Anything that violates our core values as diverse Americans.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Sign --
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: The majority.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The majority --
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: The majority.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: The majority.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: The majority
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The majority of the American people.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
CARLSON: (INAUDIBLE) call them celebrities. I didn't recognize many of them. There was an Episcopal priest in there, not surprisingly. Not everyone on Twitter was a fan of the message, though.
Here is part of the response.
EinsteinInMe said this, ""They should totally continue to lecture Americans on why they should reject Trump, because it worked out so well before the election.""
Carlos tweeted this. ""These people never stop, do they? Now they want to run the country? Unbelievable."" And yet true.
Lloyd wrote, ""These people are seething with elitism and condescension. They are part of the reason Trump was elected.""
And a man called Rambo Braveheart, probably not his real name, wrote this, ""Did Sally Field and Rosie Perez qualify as celebrities still?""
Wow, first dorm-room from way back.
And, finally, Sean Robert (ph) wrote, ""Come on, celebs, you are ruining my good movie memories. Stick to acting.""
Yes, there's a cost to videos like this and that's tonight's ""Twitter Storm.""
Coming up, the WikiLeaks email dump exposed many reporters as partisans, hardened partisan. Well, they even admitted he is a pro-Hillary hack and yet now they are back on the job covering the administration they sought to defeat.
Radio show host Chris Plante is here to talk about it, what it means, that's next.
Also, a professor is calling on Trump to quit Twitter entirely, but not for the usual reasons. He'll explain why soon.
And then a terrifying and awful new video. It shows captors beating a hostage while ""F Donald Trump"" and ""F white people."" It happened in this country, recently. We will hear that disturbing footage up ahead.
CARLSON: Well, as you know, a ton of journalists were completely disgraced after WikiLeaks revealed their throne-sniffing with the Clinton campaign. Totally, sycophantic, grovelling.
Well, now, rather than being drummed out of the business, they are back. Some are covering the Trump White House as if nothing ever happened.
A seasoned radio show host Chris Plante is here to discuss what exactly this means and how it happened.
Chris, it's great to see you.
So I'm in the gym today and I look up on one of the screens, and they are standing in front of Trump Tower with a microphone is John Harwood and I thought he can't be covering Trump. I mean, he was working on behalf of Hillary.
CHRIS PLANTE, RADIO SHOW HOST: Yes.
CARLSON: But he is.
PLANTE: Well, you said that they disgraced themselves. They didn't disgraced themselves, they are petting their resumes.
(LAUGHTER)
CARLSON: Come on.
PLANTE: They were found out in WikiLeaks. John Harwood, who is with CNBC and he writes for ""The New York Times,"" all right?
CARLSON: Yes.
PLANTE: And he is sending -- well, he is trading emails with Podesta and talking -- they are strategizing. He is warning him about Ben Carson. He could be trouble in a general and they are just kind of spit bowling and they are on the same team. It's quite clear that they have common goals.
CARLSON: And he's not even getting paid. He's doing this for free.
PLANTE: Well, that's right.
I was talking to somebody about this earlier and saying, you know, it's almost like the Soviet Union. But honestly, it's worse, because in the Soviet Union, there was a penalty for not collaborating with the state.
CARLSON: Right.
PLANTE: These guys do it quite voluntarily. They do it because they are on the team. And Hardwood is far from alone. I mean, Glenn Thrush, who was with ""The Politico"" was caught sending emails to the Clinton people for their prior approval.
CARLSON: Right.
PLANTE: He called himself in his own email a hack. He confessed, kind of lamenting perhaps that he's a hack.
(CROSSTALK)
CARLSON: So now he's got to be selling aluminium siding in Boca Raton, right? He got out of the business.
PLANTE: Well, he was with ""The Politico"" and I'll have you know he's no longer with the Politico.
CARLSON: He got out of journalism, right?
PLANTE: Well, ""The New York Times"" saw this and they said, well, we like the cut of his jib. So they hired him away from ""The Politico"" and now he's at ""The New York Times.""
CARLSON: I don't believe you, Chris Plante. Come on now.
PLANTE: Oh, it's true. He's now at ""The New York Times,"" Glenn Thrush. It's considered to be a big promotion. You are at ""The New York Times."" Now ""Politico"" it's a little sort of left-wing blog site here in Washington that once showed premise but no more.
And ""The New York Times"" saw Glenn Thrush collaborating behind the scenes surreptitiously with the Clinton campaign and they hired him away from ""The Politico."" So this is the realization of the --
(CROSSTALK)
CARLSON: But see, I'm confused by ""The New York Times."" You are a liberal paper, OK, and you want to also simultaneously pretend to be America's paper. So why would you just hire people who are surreptitiously liberal, secret liberals.
Why do you have to hire someone who everybody knows has a political agenda? You are basically not trying anymore, are you?
PLANTE: Well, no, you're right. And it's kind of, look, the news media is now conspiring out in the open against the Trump administration, against the Republican Congress. Obstructionism is now a virtue.
Remember when it was horrible? Mitch McConnell suggested that he wasn't going to support Barack Obama's agenda and the agenda of the opposing party. Now it's noble and it's a holy mission. And, honestly, there is this thing.
Have you caught on to this, where the dreaded normalization don't normalize Trump. And members of the media are chastising one another if they even meet with Trump in an off the record session or meet with him or his people behind close doors, they are being chastised by other journalist.
CARLSON: The same people that were sending campaign advice to the Hillary campaign?
PLANTE: That's exactly right.
CARLSON: Saying don't get too close.
PLANTE: And they are not all -- absolutely. Mark Leibovich, again, at ""The New York Times,"" sending his work to the Clinton people for their prior approval. They get editorial control over stories in ""The New York Times"", ""New York Times"" magazine, ""The Politico"". You know, this isn't a conspiracy theory. We know all of this to be true.
CARLSON: I would say just in the defense of him. At least Mark Leibovich is really talented. The rest of these -- John Harwood? Has he ever broken a story, has he ever written a sentence that stopped you in your tracks? We thought what a beautiful sentence. No. Never.
PLANTE: No. He's awfully bland. He's the one that during the debate suggested to Donald Trump that his candidacy was a comic book candidacy. Mocking him openly on television.
CARLSON: Can I ask you? I mean, do you think the smartest people go into journalism, do you think that top 10 percent at MIT are rushing to our newsrooms?
PLANTE: It really is a problem. Who wants to be -- who wants to --
(CROSSTALK)
CARLSON: Pretty mediocre people.
PLANTE: And another part of the problem is the pipeline. And the pipeline -- journalism schools run by old, tired, has been journalists for the most part, who are teaching the next generation of journalist that it's about the crusade, it's about the cause, it's about the fight.
(CROSSTALK)
CARLSON: That's it right there.
(CROSSTALK)
PLANTE: Look, Maggie Haberman also caught at ""The New York Times"", political reporter, award-winning.
CARLSON: Yes.
PLANTE: You know, these are all award-winning journalists at the top of the industry in the United States of America, and they've all been proven to be hacks and there's no consequence whatsoever.
Now if you ever caught one, which would never happen, collaborating with Trump behind the curtain like this, that would be the end of their career.
CARLSON: Yes. I don't think we are getting those rewards.
But your reward is in the good work that you do and it is excellent. Thanks a lot.
PLANTE: Thanks, good to see you.
CARLSON: Well, a professor from California says Trump needs to stop being on Twitter. He's been ban from Twitter actually because of his views on global warming. That professor joins us next.
And a really upsetting video of captors beating a hostage in Chicago while screaming ""F Donald Trump"" and racial epitaphs. It's a breaking story tonight. Our Oren Cass (ph) will have the latest.
CARLSON: Well, a man was taken hostage in Chicago. Pound, gag, and savagely beaten and all of it was broadcasted live on Facebook. You can find the video online and it is awful. In it, the captor yields F Donald Trump and F white people. Here is a clip.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (BEEP) Donald Trump, (BEEP) white people.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: (Inaudible).
(END VIDEO CLIP)
CARLSON: Fortunately the man is alive and recovering in a hospital. Some reports say he was disabled. Chicago police have four people in custody so far, no charges have been filed though. The victim is from one of Chicago neighboring suburbs. The story is continuing to break and we will follow it as we learn more.
Another person is calling for Donald Trump to be kick-off the twitter, this time for a very different reason. Cal State Sacramento Professor Joseph Palermo wrote in the Huggington Post quote. If Trump is cohort believe the science of global warming is bogus. Then it should not be allowed to use the science of the internet in their Twitter accounts. Professor Palermo, who specializes in American History, joins us now, Professor, thanks a lot for coming on. I am assuming you were not speaking literally but figuratively about Trump being banned from twitter. I don't imagine it as a professor you are in favor of banning people from expressing themselves, but what point are you trying to make?
JOSEPH PALERMO, CAL STATE PROFESSOR: Well I think what happened was I was visiting family in Wyoming and they are very excited about the fossil fuel boom that they expect and some of my relatives believed that they were using technology to kind of prove that on the internet and I thought it's kind of ironic for people who kind of denounce science in one area that they don't want to believe but then they benefit from science in these other areas and the idea was.
CARLSON: You said that straight those silly religious people, who don't even have (inaudible) job like you do.
PALERMO: No, no they are my love ones and you are talking to a first person who's the first in his family to go to college. Listen Tucker, let me just clarify. It was a rhetorical point that I accept the science of climate change, I've been told even Rex Tillerson does now and the Pentagon does. And here I am in the state capital, the governor, the legislature, it was uncontroversial for me to accept the science of climate change and 98 percent of the world scientists believe it is true. No matter by ideology is going to change the physics of that. What I meant was. It was misconstrued on some of these right-wing web sites. They didn't really read it. I think they came up with some really catchy headlines to get eyeballs.
CARLSON: Ok. I get it. I am giving you the benefit of the doubt I don't think you meant that from twitter. Ok, but I am interested in the claim you made that climate science that it is settled. And that 98 percent of worldwide scientist believe that. How do you know that, are you a scientist? Have you polled the scientist or what? Where did you get that figure?
PALERMO: Well, see, you know, that is another one of those interesting kind of questions is that that wasn't what the blog was about. I was accused (inaudible) censorship.
CARLSON: You just said I'm not holding you to account for censorship. I am asking about the claim you just made that 98 percent of the world scientists believe in something called climate science, if you could explain what that is in a minute. First of all, how do you know that 98 percent of all of the world scientists believe what you believe?
PALERMO: Well listen Tucker, I didn't want to get in to, are you a climate change denier or are you a skeptic? Is that where you are at?
CARLSON: The essence of science and of journalism is skepticism, because it seeks to get the truth. And I am merely asking you as someone who just said as a statement of fact that 98 percent of the world scientists agree with you whatever you believe. I'm wondering how you know that.
PALERMO: Well, ok. Well science is not just what I believe, Tucker. I mean all you need to do.
CARLSON: But how do you know that 98 percent scientist -- I often hear people say that. How do you know that? I just ask a simple question, how do you know that?
PALERMO: Well you know what, with your giant research team, you can send people out and find out about it. I am accused of advocating censorship by the President of the United States by a bunch of right-wing web sites. Now, you tell me, a professor in California, to censor the president? I mean that is such an absurd idea. So what I am saying is, you can't pick or choose your science.
CARLSON: I get it. I am not accusing you of censorship. I am not accusing of anything. I merely asking you to explain something you just said live on her show, which is the 98 percent of the scientist of the world, agree with you. The answer of course, is you have no idea what climate science is, really and you have no idea that 98 percent of the world scientist agree with you, because that is unknowable, right?
PALERMO: Well let me tell you. They predicted a long time ago that we would have high precipitation and some low precipitation events. In California, we have both. We have droughts and some wildfire which are low precipitation event. We are having high precipitation events which are floods and the hurricane and strong weather.
CARLSON: Who is that they, by the way?
PALERMO: The Clinton scientist. Do you believe in NASA, Noah, GARPA, and the Pentagon? Really, Tucker, you're going to contradict the Pentagon? The Pentagon accepts climate science, now please.
CARLSON: I merely saying, you are practicing (inaudible) religion where anybody who doesn't agree with what you believe is a heretic. It should be penalized. No, because the essence of science is asking question and I ask you a very direct question, you couldn't answers because you have no idea what the answer is. You are running around saying science this, science that, but you don't know.
PALERMO: So ok, fine, but when you go to a doctor, you don't say I need heart surgery to a doctor but how do you know how to do it? There are trained scientists all over the world.
(CROSSTALK)
CARLSON: You do not ask questions. They are not shut down for it. What you're trying to do to me is calling me names, because I am asking you a question that you can't answer.
PALERMO: I am not calling you anything. I am not calling you anything!
CARLSON: I'm a denier?
PALERMO: Well, no, I ask you when you are a skeptic or a denier. That is fine.
CARLSON: I am skeptic on everything including your answers.
PALERMO: When you get on a plane, are you skeptical of a pilot trained to fly? I mean I don't get it.
CARLSON: If the pilot smells booze I am happy to ask questions whether he is fit to fly, because I am an adult who is autonomous and I can ask questions like an adult. You are a member of a religious sec that can't deal what honest question and that is my point and I think you know that I am right.
PALERMO: that is why I called Sean Otto in my piece, brought a book called war on science, you should read, Tucker.
CARLSON: I am against on war on science.
PALERMO: Pick up a book and read about it. Try it out.
CARLSON: All right, professor, I believe in reading. Good to see you.
PALERMO: Thanks for having me on.
CARLSON: Well, Professor Palermo is not alone. In fact the liberals are so dominate. Some people say it is ruining college for everybody, not just conservative believe that, liberals believe that. One of those people is up next.
CARLSON: Our nation's colleges are kind of liberal, how liberal? Well one report says that Liberal professors outnumber conservatives, in New England in a way, 28 to one. The New Piston Boston Magazine argues that this echo chamber, this left-wing echo chamber it's ruining college for everybody liberals and conservatives alike. We offer that piece Chris Sweeney joins us now. Chris it is great to see you tonight. I went to high school and college in New England, you seem pretty liberal but 28 to 1, and I mean that is like soviet level. Is that true?
CHRIS SWEENEY, WRITER BOSTON MAGAZINE: Yes, you know it is based on 25 years with the data collected by the higher education research institute and with professor by the name of Sam Abram who looked into this and started crunching the numbers, in New England, it is 28-1 and in the rest of the country it is nowhere near that, out on the liberal west coast, it was 6-1, down south it was 3-1, Midwest it was 3-1, but in New England it was 28-1.
CARLSON: That is amazing. They have very high concentration in some of our most famous colleges and secondary schools for that matter. That doesn't happen by accident it was 28-1. There is something intentional going on. They are only hiring people who agree with them, is that what you think?
SWEENEY: Try to get into this a little bit for my reporting and I pulled a lot of people and interviewed dozens of people for this story. I could never get a one explanation as to why this is such a phenomenon in New England. Some people said you know that it is self selection. Liberals live where they work. Of course, you are going to see this type of bubble. So I think I was part of the problem. Everyone kind of has their theories as to why it's this way. Some say it's a matter of history if you go back centuries, you could look at, you know this has always been a progressive area and a lot of the great universities were progressive colleges is driving them.
CARLSON: Isn't the whole rationale for the diversity regimen, the rest of us leave under that likeminded people tend to make bad decisions, because there is no air in the room and you need someone who disagrees with you or to keep you honest. Has no one at say, Harvard, Brown, ever thought maybe we should live by the rules we impose on others?
SWEENEY: I think this is an issue that is getting a lot of attention now. I think professors are starting to become increasingly concerns about this and trying to figure out, why diversity viewpoint is essentially nonexistent in New England. You know, looking for ways to address this.
CARLSON: (Inaudible) I know I would want to around all people who agree with me on everything, I mean that really would be kind of looking on the mirror all day, what the fun on that. What is the other downside to this?
SWEENEY: You know it really undermines the whole purpose of college education which is expensive nowadays. You are supposed to be exposed to conflicting viewpoints. To learn how the world works and as one of my sources said that, the world is not full of progressives so when students are coming out of college and they are going to the workplace or whatever the next step is, you have to wonder whether they are actually prepared to step out of that bubble into the real world.
CARLSON: You know that such a good point. So, you wrote this piece for Boston magazine, is that right?
SWEENEY: I did. Yes.
CARLSON: What kind of response did you get to it? I mean, it is got to be one of the most liberal cities in the world. Did people get your car? What did people say when this piece came out?
SWEENEY: Surprising, we got a ton of letters from the editor and what we've noticed is there are a lot of old-school liberal saying this is a major problem. I got a few nasty emails but I was shocked at the number of people who emailed us saying I'm a bleeding heart liberal, 70 years old and I am shocked to read this. It wasn't as vicious as I was anticipating or at least what we have so far.
CARLSON: I believe that. A lot of the old school liberals are pretty honest and they believe in free speech, and they are not all bad. Actually it was the young ones are scary, I think. Chris thanks a lot for joining us. That was a really interesting piece.
SWEENEY: Thank you.
CARLSON: Trump's inauguration will be the first inauguration since marijuana possession was legalized in Washington D.C. Will it be reefer madness? Looks like it, the tales next.
And Kimberly Guilfoyle, ladies and gentlemen, back due to popular demand, in the friend zone tonight. Missing out you apparel it is going to be excellent. Stay tuned.
CARLSON: Well, here is something new. President-Elect Donald Trump Inauguration will feature free marijuana, thanks to a group of D.C. Pot activists. The organization D.C.M.J. will hand out thousands of free joints on circle on Inauguration morning. It will wake and bake here in the Capital before walking to the National Mall, 4 minutes and 20 seconds into Trumps speech. Participants will light up in the effort to convince the federal government to legalized pots. That will work for sure. The group's founder said we give away as legal as long as it done on D.C. property, smoking on federal land could put protesters in handcuffs. (Inaudible) one city that is how weird D.C. is.
Time now for the friend zone, we invite one of our friend in the building at Fox on to the show. Tonight, we are joined by one of our best friends, co-host to The Five, Kimberly Guilfoyle, ladies and gentlemen. K.G., how are you?
KIMBERLY GUILFOYLE, THE FIVE CO-HOST: Very good, Tucker, very well, tonight.
CARLSON: Thank you. The thing about having -- I hope you will come on every night. Because every time you do, I learned something about you I didn't know, and I did not know this, our producers found it, maybe ten or 15 years ago there with a famous dog case in San Francisco where a woman walking back to her apartment in Pacific Heights was killed by two dogs and they were owned by lawyers who got the dogs from a white supremacist, it was in prison. You were involved on that case.
GUILFOYLE: Here I am. You see me right there at the table.
CARLSON: That was crazy.
GUILFOYLE: Yes, I was one of the prosecutors and it is actually a precedent setting case in the United States for second degree inside Malice murder. I charged the two attorneys that owned the dogs with murder, brought it to the grand jury and it was changed, the venue down to Los Angeles so I actually filed the case in front of one of the jury's downtown where O.J. Simpson was tried. Was able to get a second degree murder conviction, I had a contract on my life to have me killed, because they didn't like the Puerto Rican lawyer that was prosecuting these people that were there lawyers. They said no, we don't want her. So I stayed on the case, bulletproof vest, lock place, the whole deal had security sleeping with me. You know in the room. And managed to survive and convict and persevere. And it's actually how I got my start in television, because after doing that, then I got the call to come work in television.
CARLSON: That is amazing. So, what happen - it was every here. The guy was in Pelican Bay as I remember.
GUILFOYLE: That is correct in a maximum security and so they were running a dog breeding business out of Pelican Bay and then these two attorneys fell in love with this guy. I am not making it up. They adopted him and took these two dogs, Fame and Harah, the two dogs were the ones responsible obviously for mauling the woman to death. It is very sad case, very disturbing national lacrosse champions from St. Mary and then went back to coach there. That is a picture of me and some video you have from the court room. It was a pretty amazing experience. I still think about it to this day. I have the medical examiner on the stand for four hours, because of all that extended injuries, 76 straight and defined areas of injury.
CARLSON: that was a horrible story. I remember that so well. I just completely forgot that you were the center of it. How would you compare the intensity of trying a case like that, a murder case, to cable news?
GUILFOYLE: These days?
(LAUGHTER)
CARLSON: Yes these days.
GUILFOYLE: Well I think it prepared me well. For any kind of television cross examined live cross examination, it really did make me being a lawyer like that that, I tried everything up through death penalty cases. It prepared me for television certainly it prepared me for the friend zone. And you know back and forth and I say most especially, for the five, right?
CARLSON: That no one goes to prison. And most other people, very much, including me, there been like most journalists, she has lived a life.
GUILFOYLE: Live a life.
CARLSON: K.G. thanks a lot.
GUILFOYLE: All right, Tucker. It was a pleasure my friend.
CARLSON: See you. Well coming up we make you king for a day. We have that authority. That is next.
CARLSON: And now retrieve your crown, because you are king for day. If you have absolute power and you could do one thing to change and improve this country, what would it be? That is the question we ask every week and we got great answers like this, from DV who wrote this. Give everyone a four day work week and making same amount and volunteer for their favorite charity one day a week. In other words become France.
Tom Magdaleno wrote create moving sidewalks just like at the airport inside large cities and minimize inner-City vehicular traffic. Yes, wouldn't help the obesity crisis though.

0	35	 36 von 72	Fox News Network	January 4, 2017 Wednesday	 FOX SPECIAL REPORT WITH BRET BAIER	 6:00 PM EST		"BRET BAIER, FOX NEWS HOST: Obamacare on life support. So what's next? The President and the Vice President-Elect pitch their parties on Capitol Hill.
This is SPECIAL REPORT.
Good evening. Welcome to Washington. I am Bret Baier.
Vice President-Elect Mike Pence promised lawmakers today that dismantling Obamacare will be the first order of business when Donald Trump takes office 16 days from now.
But President Obama is not going out without a fight. Both the President and the Vice President-Elect were on Capitol Hill today, meeting their respective parties and gearing up for what surely will be a contentious fight in Congress on this issue.
We have Fox team coverage tonight. Correspondent Kevin Corke is at the White House with the President's call to action that lacked specifics for Democrats pushback. Chief Washington correspondent James Rosen also from the White House with a look at Obamacare's controversial journey until now. But we begin with chief congressional correspondent, Mike Emanuel on Capitol Hill where the Vice President-Elect laid out the new administration's plans to do away with this law. 
Good evening -- Mike.
MIKE EMANUEL, FOX NEWS CHIEF CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Bret -- good evening.
Vice President-Elect Mike Pence told Republicans they are all on one team. And starting January 20th, Inauguration Day, they will have a new coach, and they intend to hit the ground running.
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
MIKE PENCE (R), VICE PRESIDENT-ELECT: The first order of business is to repeal and replace Obamacare.
EMANUEL: Vice President-Elect Pence was back on Capitol Hill for the first full work day of the 115th Congress and tweeted a photo of his meeting with House Republicans. His goal was firing up the GOP about moving forward on a new agenda.
PENCE: We are 16 days away from the end of business as usual in Washington, D.C. Today our message is very simple -- working with the leadership here in the House and in the Senate. We're going to be in the promise-keeping business.
EMANUEL: As Pence was heading to Capitol Hill, President-Elect Trump took to Twitter to warn ""Republicans must be careful in that the Dems own the failed Obamacare disaster with its poor coverage and massive premium increases like the 116 percent hike in Arizona. Also deductibles are so high that it is practically useless. Don't let the Schumer clowns out of this web. Massive increases of Obamacare will take place this year and Dems are to blame for the mess. It will fall of its own weight -- be careful.""
Chuck Schumer, the Senate Democratic leader fired back.
SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D), MINORITY LEADER: Republicans will soon learn that you can't keep the good parts of the ACA and remove the rest of the law and still have it work.
EMANUEL: Pence said he echoed Mr. Trump's social media message behind closed doors.
PENCE: I admonished members of the House Republican Congress today. It's important that we remind the American people of what they already know about Obamacare. The promises that were made were all broken.
EMANUEL: And Speaker Paul Ryan said while repeal of the President's signature healthcare law would come swiftly, lawmakers will be careful to make sure consumers aren't hurt.
REP. PAUL RYAN (R-WI), SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE: We want to make sure that as we give relief to people to Obamacare, we do it in a transition that doesn't pull the rug out from anybody during that transition period. That's the point that we are all trying to make.
EMANUEL: As Republicans leaders call for an orderly transition, what comes next is unclear. Some GOP members are proposing a simultaneous repeal and replace. Others are suggesting a lengthy and deliberative process of two to four years to limit disruptions.
After a lunch with GOP senators, Pence was asked what happens if replacing the law gets messy.
PENCE: The simple fact is the American people know who owns Obamacare.
(END VIDEOTAPE)
EMANUEL: Lawmakers are hoping to have the Obamacare repeal on President Trump's desk by the February 20th. Before that Pence said Mr. Trump will take a series of executive actions to start unraveling the law -- Bret.
BAIER: Mike Emanuel, live on the Hill. Mike -- thank you.
Despite the fact that Republicans will soon control both chambers of Congress and the White House, President Obama wants to make sure his party does not let his signature health care law go down without a serious fight.
Correspondent Kevin Corke reports tonight from the White House on the President's nonspecific but impassioned push to hold on to his legacy domestic policy achievement.
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
KEVIN CORKE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Less than three weeks before he begins a long and reflective walk into history, President Obama left a short message for the congressional Democrats he will leave behind.
BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Look out for the American people.
CORKE: Look out for the American people as in, continue to fight for his signature legislation, the Affordable Care Act, Obamacare. Mr. Obama's comments following a rare trip to Capitol Hill for a closed-door meeting with House and Senate Democrats.
SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D), NEW YORK: The President articulated the importance of preserving the Affordable Care Act, Medicare, and Medicaid as only he can. And it was an inspiring meeting for all of us.
REP. ELIJA CUMMINGS (D), MARYLAND: He basically said he envies us because he would like to be still in office to some degree, to fight with us.
REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA), MINORITY LEADER: The President's message was one of confidence, confidence in the Affordable Care Act and what it means and does for people, confidence in its implementation.
CORKE: From creating national monuments in Utah and Nevada to banning offshore oil drilling in the arctic, deleting the database of Muslim men at the Department of Homeland Security and expelling Russian operatives because of alleged hacking during the run-up to the election critics suggest the President's trip to the Hill today to pitch the merits of Obamacare was little more than yet another push to preserve his legacy.
And at least one Democrat, West Virginia Senator Joe Manchin, wanted no part of it.
SEN. JOE MANCHIN (D), WEST VIRGINIA: I thought it would be counterproductive for me to go and sit there. And I thought why couldn't we have come together? Why couldn't he have invited both sides and said whoever wants to come, come, we'll give you our opinion?
REP. STEVE SCALISE (R-LA), MAJORITY WHIP: I hope he comes here to apologize for those broken promises. But I don't think that's what's going to be the case. I think he is going to be here more concerned about preserving his legacy than about fulfilling those promises.
CORKE: White House officials do admit Mr. Obama is concerned about the prospects of seeing much of his agenda undone in the coming years but they're holding out hope that Democrats who will serve long after he's gone will stand up to the GOP.
JOSH EARNEST, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: The people who are in by far the best position to prevent that from happening are congressional Democrats who are unified around the idea that those things are worth fighting for.
CORKE: A clamorous political battle ahead at a time when most presidents quietly walk off the national stage.
(END VIDEOTAPE)
CORKE: Keyword there, most presidents are expected to sort of walk away quietly. Not this one, apparently. And Bret -- we can tell you that while the White House acknowledges the President will likely remain engaged behind the scenes in many of the policy and agenda items that basically shaped his presidency over the past eight years, we also learned tonight that Vice President Joe Biden will have posts at both that the University of Pennsylvania and the University of Delaware where he is expected to talk about policy both foreign and domestic -- (Inaudible).
Back to you.
BAIER: Kevin Corke, live on the north lawn. Kevin -- thank you.
President Obama meantime will stay here in Washington, D.C. with his family.
Now some perspective and a look back. The term ""Obamacare"" began as one of derision, but the man whose name it carries eventually came to embrace it with gusto.
As our chief Washington correspondent James Rosen reports tonight from the White House, just about everything associated with the President's signature domestic policy has been shrouded in controversy from the very beginning.
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
JAMES ROSEN, FOX NEWS CHIEF WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT: It was the defining promise of Barack Obama's presidency.
OBAMA: If you like the plan you have, you can keep it.
ROSEN: That promise repeated three dozen times made the patient protection Affordable Care Act, the law better known as Obamacare -- the President's most contentious domestic initiative.
At town halls, critics vented their anger, in part stirred by the Tea Party Movement --
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Strike it down. Strike it down.
ROSEN: -- which arose to oppose what it called socialized medicine. Even a bipartisan brainstorming session at Blair House saw the President abrade (ph) his 2008 opponent.
OBAMA: We are not campaigning. The election's over.
ROSEN: To cover the 44 million Americans who lack health insurance, the 900-page measure expanded Medicaid subsidies, offered online exchanges embraced by 39 states, fined noncompliant employers and penalized uninsured people. The measure also allowed children to remain on parents' plans through age 26 and banned insurers from denying coverage on the basis of pre-existing conditions.
When Republicans mustered 41 votes against Obamacare, the Democrats employed the parliamentary tactic of reconciliation, requiring only 51 votes for passage.
BAIER: And we don't know exactly what's in the fixed bill. Do you --
OBAMA: No, we will -- by the time the vote has taken place, not only I will know what's in it, you will know what's in it.
ROSEN: The House Speaker memorably reversed that.
PELOSI: We need to pass the bill so that you can find out what is in it.
ROSEN: Ultimately Obamacare passed with no Republican support and was signed into law in March 2010. As its provisions took effect, the online exchanges suffered pervasive glitches and an estimated four million people lost their plans, if violations of the President's promise for which he begrudgingly apologized.
OBAMA: And, you know, that's on me.
ROSEN: More than 20 million Americans have received coverage under the law.
OBAMA: For the first time in our history, more than 90 percent of Americans are insured.
ROSEN: But it has been dogged by problems.
BILL CLINTON (D), FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: and then the people are out busting it sometimes 60 hours a week, wind up with their premiums doubled and their coverage cut in half. It's the craziest thing in the world.
(END VIDEOTAPE)
ROSEN: Regardless of how the effort to repeal and replace Obamacare goes, it will go down in history as one of the most ambitious White House projects of the post-war era. And if it is discarded by the Trump administration, it will also go down as one of the shortest lived -- Bret.
BAIER: James Rosen in the White House briefing room. James -- thank you.
The President-Elect says he is suspending judgment until Friday over whether Russia really was behind the hacks of the Democratic Party and the Clinton officials leading up the U.S. election. Friday is when President- Elect Trump is expected to receive a briefing by leaders of the intelligence committee about what they know. But the CIA director is not waiting until then to say he has proof Russia is to blame.
Chief intelligence correspondent Catherine Herridge has our report tonight.
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
JOHN BRENNAN, CIA DIRECTOR: He's not exactly a bastion of truth and integrity.
CATHERINE HERRIDGE, FOX NEWS CHIEF INTELLIGENCE CORRESPONDENT: In the PBS interview, CIA director John Brennan cast doubt on the credibility of WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who told Fox News the Russian government was not his source for the DNC and Clinton campaign emails.
BRENNAN: I wouldn't, you know, ascribe to any of these individuals for making comments that it is providing the whole, unvarnished truth. Again, this report is going to include what it is that we know about what happened, what was collected, what disclosed.
HERRIDGE: Pressed on the hacker's intent, which usually requires intelligence from human spying or an intercepted phone call, Brennan promised specifics.
JUDY WOODRUFF, PBS ANCHOR: Do you think the motive of the Russians was to help Donald Trump?
BRENNAN: That's one of the things that will be addressed inside their report. I'm not going to address that in advance of its release.
HERRIDGE: In 2010, Assange's WikiLeaks worked with then Army Private Bradley Manning to release several hundred thousand classified Defense Department documents, endangering sources and methods, according to a former FBI operative.
TIMOTHY GILL, FORMER FBI INTELLIGENCE OFFICER: Sensitive intelligence is just not words on paper but it's lives in danger.
HERRIDGE: At the time, Donald Trump told Fox's Brian Kilmeade the leaks were un-American.
DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENT-ELECT: I think it's a disgrace.
BRIAN KILMEADE, FOX NEWS HOST: You don't think it's a disgrace --
(inaudible)
HERRIDGE: In the new Fox interview broadcast Tuesday, Assange also claimed the theft of Clinton campaign manager John Podesta's emails was child's play.
JULIAN ASSANGE, WIKILEAKS: Podesta gave out that his password was the word ""password"". His own staff said this e-mail that you've received, this is totally legitimate. So this is something a 14-year-old kid -- a 14-year- old kid could have hacked.
HERRIDGE: In a tweet Mr. Trump picked up Assange's charge saying the Democrats were careless and to blame. On Capitol Hill, the Vice President- Elect defended his boss.
PENCE: Given some of the intelligence failures of recent years, the President-Elect has made it clear to the American people that he's skeptical about conclusions from bureaucracy and I think the American people hear him loud and clear.
HERRIDGE: Although the Republican House Speaker told a conservative radio show he has no opinion of Assange.
RYAN: Other than I think the guy is a sycophant for Russia -- he leaks, he steals data and compromises national security.
(END VIDEOTAPE)
HERRIDGE: Tonight Fox News is told the classified report is virtually complete and President Obama could be briefed as early as tomorrow, the same day that Director of National Intelligence James Clapper and the NSA director Mike Rogers will testify to the Senate about foreign cyber threats to the U.S. -- Bret
BAIER: We'll follow it. Catherine -- thank you.
HERRIDGE: You're welcome.
BAIER: So what do you think? Do you think President-Elect Trump is right to seemingly side with Julian Assange over the intelligence community about Russia and the hacks? Or at least express that skepticism on Twitter? Let me know on Twitter @BretBaier, you can use the #SpecialReport or on Facebook at facebook.com/BretBaierSR. We may use your comments later in the panel.
President Obama asked for a seamless transition to the next president at his last meeting with his top military leaders today. The commander-in- chief said he's doing everything possible to ensure that Donald Trump benefits from the advice of his current military brass. He cited the ongoing fight against ISIS in Iraq and Syria as conflicts the next president will inherit. President Obama was then honored for his service at a ceremony at Joint Base Myer in Virginia where he reflected on his tenure in front of a sparse crowd.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
OBAMA: We live free under the red, white, and blue because of patriots like you. It has been a privilege of a lifetime to serve with you.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
BAIER: The U.S. and its allies are doubling the number military advisors helping Iraqi forces battle ISIS in Mosul. For the first time, the Pentagon admitted U.S. forces are operating inside Mosul saying the forces are moving in and out of that city. But a U.S. military spokesman said the advisors are not operating on the front lines there.
Four Gitmo detainees are slated to be transferred to Saudi Arabia in the next 24 hours -- the first of the final wave of up to 20 transfers expected before inauguration day. U.S. officials are telling Fox News, they say that President-Elect Trump strongly opposes any more transfers off the base. But senior Pentagon officials saying until Trump is president the transfers will go on as scheduled.
Well, candidate Donald Trump held his last formal press conference 161 days ago. Since that time now, the President-Elect has sent nearly 1,300 tweets weighing in on everything from nuclear arms to who may be performing at his inauguration.
Correspondent Peter Doocy reports from New York tonight on the latest news coming out of Trump Tower.
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
PETER DOOCY, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: The inauguration is inching closer and closer but the President-Elect still doesn't think people get him. He tweeted today about a 16-year-old singer set to start his ceremony with the National Anthem by saying this. Quote, ""Jackie Evancho's album sales have skyrocketed after announcing her inauguration performance. Some people just don't understand the movement.""
Mr. Trump is also using Twitter to forecast that we will see headlines about additional American companies doing what Ford just did, investing in the States to avoid hefty import taxes. Writing quote, ""Thank you to Ford for scrapping a new plant in Mexico and creating 700 new jobs in the U.S. This is just the beginning, much more to follow.""
A big part of the Trump economic plan is cutting red tape. But he's going to need someone to make sure companies are still following the new rules. So he picked regulatory lawyer, Jay Clayton to run the Securities and Exchange Commission.
That selection comes as Mr. Trump's pick to be the next secretary of State is working ahead of next week's confirmation hearings to eliminate any concerns about a conflict of interest with ExxonMobil where he was on the payroll until New Year's Day. Rex Tillerson is in line to get $180 million from the oil giant as a retirement package, money that would go into a trust that would not be allowed to invest back in Exxon stock.
Two other picks for top Trump administration jobs are having bumpier beginnings to '17. Liberal groups are up with ads accusing Trump Treasury secretary pick Steven Mnuchin of profiting off the foreclosure crisis.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Tell Senator Heller to vote no on Mnuchin.
DOOCY: And in Mobile, Alabama, an NAACP protest about decades-old comments made by Senator Jeff Sessions, Trump's pick for Attorney General got half a dozen people arrested, including that group's president.
Up in D.C. Senator Chuck Schumer is now outlining his plan of attack against Senator Sessions, one of the eight nominees he wants to slow down on their way to the cabinet room.
SCHUMER: It's hard for me to countenance an attorney general who is so anti-immigration.
(END VIDEOTAPE)
DOOCY: The President-Elect has expressed very little faith in the intelligence community. But just a few minutes ago, a senior transition source texted to confirm that a leading contender to come in and clean things up as the next director of National Intelligence is former Indiana Senator Dan Coats. Sources tell our colleague Mike Emanuel that the Vice President-Elect, Indiana governor Mike Pence is really pushing the Indiana connection with that one -- Bret.
BAIER: Peter Doocy outside Trump Tower. Peter -- thank you.
Turkey's foreign minister says they know the suspect behind the New Year's Eve nightclub attack that killed 39 people in Istanbul but they still have not named him publicly. The state-run news agency reports police have detained 20 suspects, including 11 women who are believed to have lived with the terrorist. ISIS claimed responsibility for that attack but tonight suspect who carried it out is still on the loose. Police in Istanbul have set up checkpoints and are checking vehicles across that city.
Israel's prime minister is calling for the pardon of an Israeli soldier convicted today of manslaughter in the death of a wounded Palestinian attacker. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's request for a pardon plunges him into a political debate that has divided the country over this case and puts him at odds with the Israeli military. Israel's president has the authority to issue a pardon but said he will wait for the legal process to run its course before making a decision.
Up next, a closer look at some of the conservative credentials of President-Elect Trump's picks to fill the vacant seat on the U.S. Supreme Court.
First, here is some of what our Fox affiliates around the country are covering tonight.
Fox 13 in Seattle where health officials have confirmed nine flu-related deaths in Washington just three weeks into the flu season. The state's Health Department says cases are now at epidemic levels and widespread across that state. Doctors seeing the spike in flu cases are urging everyone to get a flu shot.
Fox 35 in Orlando where Republican Governor Rick Scott wants nearly $6 million to hire more state agents dedicated to counterterrorism efforts. The governor's request follows last year's terror attack on the Pulse Nightclub that left 49 people dead.
And this is a live look at New York from our affiliate Fox 5. The big story there tonight a train derailment during this morning's rush hour that injured more than 100 people. Investigators say a Long Island railroad train hit the bumping block as it came into the Brooklyn station a little after 8:00 this morning. New York's governor said the most significant known injury was a possible broken leg. The cause of the crash is still under investigation -- one of several in that region in recent months.
That is tonight's live look outside the Beltway from SPECIAL REPORT. We'll be right back.
BAIER: Democrat Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer promises a fight over President-Elect Donald Trump's pick for the U.S. Supreme Court vacancy. But even before he has a chance to try to block any potential nominee, some pro-life leaders are raising their own concerns over some of the conservative credentials on the President-Elect's list so far.
Chief legal correspondent, Shannon Bream joins us now live with a look some of their records. Good evening -- Shannon.
SHANNON BREAM, FOX NEWS CHIEF LEGAL CORRESPONDENT: Hi -- Bret.
Well yes, the new senate minority leader is not going to take it easy on the President-Elect's Supreme Court nominee once we find out who that will be. Schumer says the GOP basically stole the Supreme Court seat left vacant by the death of Justice Scalia by refusing to move on the President's nominee, Judge Merrick Garland. And it sounds like things could get complicated on Capitol Hill.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
SCHUMER: It's hard for me to imagine a nominee that Donald Trump would choose that would get Republican support that we could support. So, you are right.
RACHEL MADDOW, MSNBC HOST: And so you would do your best to hold the seat open?
SCHUMER: Absolutely.
SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY), MAJORITY LEADER: I think that is something the American people simply will not tolerate. And we'll be looking forward to receiving a Supreme Court nomination and moving forward on it.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
BREAM: It is not surprising the left would question Mr. Trump's eventual nominee but there are growing concerns from some on the right as well. A coalition of pro-life groups and leaders just sent a letter saying they are worried about some of the candidates on the list of 21 potential picks Mr. Trump has released. Quote, ""We urge you to consider, not consider candidates lacking a pro-life record. Several of these judges on the list have even written or spoken in ways that are at odds with the pro-life position.""
The Trump transition team says not to worry. All are being thoroughly vetted.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
LEONARD LEO, TRUMP TRANSITION MEMBER: The President is working very hard to get this right and these are people who have very deep records that have to be analyzed very carefully and lots of cases have to be read. And there is no one particular statement or comment by any of these prospective nominees that can be viewed in isolation.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
BREAM: First Liberty Institute, a group that takes on religious freedom legal fights has been pouring through all of the opinions of the judges on Mr. Trump's list and says there's a way to calm conservative fears.
KELLY SHACKELFORD, FIRST LIBERTY INSTITUTE: There are many other excellent judges on the list that have no red flags; and in fact, a very solid judicial background that would make excellent choices at the U.S. Supreme Court.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
BREAM: It will take 60 votes in the Senate to get any Supreme Court nominee passed, the first procedural hurdle. So unless something changes, Republicans will need some help from across the aisle -- Bret.
BAIER: Shannon -- thank you.
The sentencing phase began today for the man convicted of killing nine black church members in South Carolina. And speaking before the court, the convicted killer did not ask jurors to spare his life from the death penalty.
Correspondent Jonathan Serrie reports from Charleston tonight on day one in court.
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
JONATHAN SERRIE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: In his opening statement, Dylann Roof made no mention of his crime or his motives. Instead, the defendant calmly and quietly told jurors he chose to act as his own attorney to prevent his defense team from entering evidence about his mental health. Roof insisted quote, ""There is nothing wrong with me psychologically.""
The same jurors who last month convicted Roof in the 2015 massacre at Charleston's historically black Emanuel AME Church must now decide whether he should spend the rest of his life in prison or face execution.
Prosecutor Nathan Williams argued for the latter, citing Roof's racist motives and lack of remorse for the crime. Williams read from a hand- written statement found in Roof's cell a month after the crimes in which he states ""I do not regret what I did. I'm not sorry. I have not shed a tear for the innocent people I killed. I do feel sorry for the innocent white children forced to live in this sick country.""
Prosecutors have begun calling on relatives of the nine deceased shooting victims to describe the emotional pain that Dylann Roof inflicted on their families and their community.
MALCOLM GRAHAM, BROTHER OF SHOOTING VICTIM: There is no room for him in a civilized society. I believe there's no room for him in America's smallest jail.
SERRIE: Malcolm Graham plans to testify about his sister, Cynthia Heard (ph) a dedicated librarian and active church member who perished in the shootings. He tells Fox News some crimes are so heinous the only logical penalty is death.
GRAHAM: My sister and eight others died simply because they were there that and they were black. And that cannot stand in a civilized society. And that has to be punished.
(END VIDEOTAPE)
SERRIE: The hearing is expected to go into next week with prosecutors calling on as many as 38 witnesses. Dylann Roof on the other hand says he intends to call no witnesses and present no evidence. However, he does plan on making a closing argument -- Bret.
BAIER: Jonathan Serrie in Charleston. Jonathan -- thank you.
Crime in New York City is down according to data released today. The Big Apple had its fewest number of shootings last year and narrowly missed setting a record low for homicides. And overall crime was at its lowest in New York City. The city's police commissioner says the numbers are the result of careful police strategies and increased work with communities.
Democrats in California say they will challenge the incoming Trump administration on everything from immigration to the environment. And now state legislators have hired a former attorney general to help them do just that.
National correspondent, William La Jeunesse from Los Angeles tonight on the man they have picked to lead their fight.
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
GOV. JERRY BROWN (D), CALIFORNIA: If Trump turns off the satellites, California will launch its own damn satellites.
WILLIAM LA JEUNESSE, FOX NEWS NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Two weeks before Donald Trump even takes office, California is preparing for battle, hiring former Attorney General Eric Holder to challenge the new administration.
ANTHONY RENDON (D), CALIFORNIA ASSEMBLY SPEAKER: It's up to us in this body to pass policies that would firewall Californians and what we believe from the cynical, shortsighted and reactionary agenda that is rising in the wake of this election.
LA JEUNESSE: From education to climate change, the state hopes to stop or stall Trump's policy reforms.
BROWN: We have the laws, we have the tools of enforcement, and we have the political will. And we will set the stage, set the example that whatever Washington thinks they are doing, California is the future.
HANS VON SPAKOVSKY, HERITAGE FOUNDATION: By hiring Holder, it is like they are firing a shot across the bow of the Trump administration's new liner.
LA JEUNESSE: Former Justice Department lawyer Hans von Spakovsky wrote a book about Holder, the only cabinet member ever to be held in contempt of congress.
SPAKOVSKY: It's going to cost them a lot of money to try to fight the federal government, for example, on immigration enforcement in sanctuary cities. And in the end, they are going to lose.
LA JEUNESSE: But with 38 percent of federal judgeships filled by Obama appointees, California offers other states and special interests that will act standing a platform to sue.
RENDON: We need to fight to protect our people and their rights.
LA JEUNESSE: State lawmakers say they will pay Holder $25,000 a month to be a thorn in Trump's side not unlike the hold Texas played against President Obama, filing 46 lawsuits, winning seven, losing or withdrawing 21, 18 are still pending.
The first battleground, likely immigration as defiant state Democrats offer $80 million taxpayer to protect 2.3 million illegal immigrants from deportation, an approach endorsed by the L.A. mayor Eric Garcetti.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: When people work under the table, when they're pushed to the shadows, that depresses wages for native born folks. That means fewer business starts.
(END VIDEOTAPE)
LA JEUNESSE: Holder said in a statement that he is, quote, ""honored to serve as the state's legal advisor as it considers how to respond to potential changes in federal law."" Bret?
BAIER: William, thank you.
The Dow gained 60 today, putting it fewer than 60 points from the 20,000 mark. The S&P 500 was up 13. The NASDAQ finished ahead 48.
Whether the outgoing president has a fighting chance to try to save Obamacare, his legacy, domestic policy issue. The all-star panel weighs in on that next.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
GOV. MIKE PENCE, (R) VICE PRESIDENT ELECT: The first order of business is to repeal and replace Obamacare. Our president-elect took his case to the American people to repeal and replace Obamacare, and the American people voted decisively for a better future for health care in this country.
CHARLES SCHUMER, (D-NY) SENATE MINORITY LEADER: Once they come up with a full replace plan, we will look at it, may be propose a change or two. But we're not going to the minute after they repeal sit down with them and say let's see what we can do now.
NANCY PELOSI, (D-CA) HOUSE MINORITY LEADER: The president's message was one of confidence, confidence in the Affordable Care Act, confidence in the humility that we have to listen to other ideas they have in their replace, something that works, that gets results. And we shouldn't be opposed to that.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
BAIER: President Obama meeting with Democrats. Vice president elect Pence meeting with Republicans up on Capitol Hill. The topic, Obamacare. If you look at this map from ""USA Today,"" it shows the premium rate increases around the country, and you can see there are some above 50 percent states in there, but a lot of them in the 30 to 50 percent shading on this. That doesn't even include the deductibles that people are dealing with in their health care situation.
This comes as the president-elect made clear his feelings on this battle. ""Republicans must be careful. The Dems owned the failed Obamacare disaster with its poor coverage and massive premium increases, like the 116 percent hike in Arizona. Also deductibles are so high that it's practically useless. Don't let the Schumer clowns out of this web. Massive increases in Obamacare will take place this year and Dems are to blame. It will fall on its own weight. Be careful"" is the warning on Twitter. A lot of people ask why do you read those tweets? That's the way he's communicating. So we're reading them, what's going on today.
Let's bring in our panel, Charles Hurt, political columnist for ""The Washington Times,"" Mercedes Schlapp, columnist for the ""Washington Times,"" David Catanese, senior politics writer for ""U.S. News and World Report,"" and Jonah Goldberg, senior editor of ""National Review."" OK, Jonah, it seemed like the president went up there and said, hey, you guys need to stop this. When it came to how, what are they going to do, there was not a lot there there.
JONAH GOLDBERG, SENIOR EDITOR, ""NATIONAL REVIEW"": You can mark it as a 2017 miracle. I agree entirely with something Donald Trump tweeted. I think he's absolutely right. This is a difficult position that the Republicans are in in part because a lot of Obamacare passed with 60 votes. You can't get rid of those parts through reconciliation.
They talk about how this is going to be -- the press is irresponsible in a lot of its talk about repeal. You can't keep all of the popular parts of Obamacare which Donald Trump promises to do and still call it repeal. It is something else.
And lastly, because of Obamacare's own internal flaws, it's sort of like a suicidal dying patient. And the Republicans are leaping into be the doctor of record for the patient, and that's a real political problem for them. They can make it die faster but they can't save it and they can't get a replacement for it very soon either.
BAIER: So, Dave, are the Democrats saying you guys hold the old maid card now?
DAVID CATANESE, ""U.S. NEWS AND WORLD REPORT"": It's incredible. You saw an entirely new frame of Obamacare presented today. The Democrats are now saying, they are labeling it Trumpcare as a potential replacement. They are saying Trumpcare will make you sick. And now the Republicans are sending out releases saying the Democrats are obstructing health care reform. Think about how that has flipped.
I think the bottom line is that leadership is going to have to come more than by tweets from the president-elect. Remember how President Obama got through the original health care reform. He drove the principles. They argued over the public option, whether there should be an individual mandate. We don't know what president-elect Trump wants in that and he's the only person that can unify the Republican Party. Otherwise you're going to have legislators every day saying this is what I wanted, this is what I wanted, 100 ideas that's not comprehensive. It has to come from Trump, has to come from the White House.
BAIER: We should take a moment, Mercedes. It is the Republican's ball now. The onus is on them. They have both chambers of Congress and the White House. But the president, you remember, said, he started his time in office saying 36 times if you like the plan you have, you can keep it. Now he's ending his time in office defending the plan that is falling apart.
MERCEDES SCHLAPP, ""WASHINGTON TIMES"": President Obama is trying to save his legacy on Obamacare. He is telling the Democrats stand your ground. And he's also saying he's taking responsibility for the fact that they didn't communicate. They didn't message it correctly. This is not a messaging problem. This is a failed policy problem. This is the fact that you have Obamacare where you've had tax increases, premium hikes. You've had one in five consumers who now only have access to a single insurer. The majority of Americans are not happy. They disapprove of Obamacare.
This is the opportunity for Republicans to take hold of this process. The problem is that if there's one lesson the Republicans should learn it's the fact that Obama pushed Obamacare and Congress pushed Obamacare only with Democrats. It was not a bipartisan effort. It would be wise for the Republicans to bring the Democrats along, create a bipartisan effort so both parties have responsibility.
CHARLES HURT, POLITICAL COLUMNIST, ""WASHINGTON TIMES"": One of the biggest misnomer's of all this is when people say that Obamacare -- Democrats admit that Obamacare is not working. Of course it's working exactly as they intended. What it means is a lot of people who work are going to face huge premium increases to pay for people who previously didn't have health care. So it is actually working the way it was designed to work.
BAIER: The problem was they were supposed to win the White House and change it into a bigger system.
HURT: Right. As Mercedes says, this is the problem. The James Rosen package I thought had the most important quote of the entire effort where President Obama is sitting there meeting outside the White House with Republicans. He said we are not campaigning anymore and the election is over, as if, you know, campaigns are just politics where we say stuff that doesn't mean anything. This is a knife fight now and we are pushing our agenda.
And I do think, whether you call it health care reform or whatever, getting buy-in from Democrats, while that meet uncomfortable for a lot of us, it's probably not a bad thing. And I think Trump is probably uniquely qualified to try to do that.
BAIER: Here is Speaker Paul Ryan on people potentially losing insurance in this whole change.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
REP. PAUL RYAN, (R) SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES: We have been saying all along we don't want to pull the rug out from people while we are replacing the law. The point is in 2017 we don't want people to be caught with nothing. We want to make sure that there's an orderly transition so that the rug is not pulled out from under the families who are currently struggling under Obamacare while we bring relief.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
BAIER: Jonah, according to HHS, they've had 20 million people gaining health insurance since the law passed in 2010 to early 2016. But 4.7 million had individual policies canceled in 2013 because they didn't measure up. One in five consumers only has one insurer. You go through this list, and it's pretty horrific. It seems like the challenge will be how do you get from point A to point B.
GOLDBERG: Right, I think the easiest part of the task in terms of messaging is that most of the people are signups on Obamacare are Medicare, and they are going to stay on that. You might have to tell them that may not be true couple years for now, but that's fairly safe.
The question is what you tell the people who have been jerked around by those clowns in Washington for six years in terms of their private, you know, market plans, all these other things, employer plans, been kicked off this, kicked off that, premiums going up, that the Republicans got in and they were supposed to have a solution and instead that process just accelerates for a while longer. I really think, sometimes firemen show up on the scene and they just let the building burned to the ground and then you build new. I don't know that they have to do repeal on day one. I think Mercedes is right, there is room for Trump to come up with a solution here, and taking ownership of this, if that's the risk, it's tough.
BAIER: And they have a lot of things out there. They have crossing state lines. They have opening up the markets, health savings accounts, they have a lot of things but they don't have one thing.
CATANESE: And there is already disagreement about whether to even keep the taxes and place among Republicans. You guys are focused on the Democrats. The Republicans aren't unified on how to approach this. And I talked to a Senate leadership aide today who said Mike Pence told us he wants legislation by February 20th. That's a month.
Now, given everything else that's going to suck up this news cycle, confirmation hearings, a Supreme Court pick, are Republicans going to be able to do this with repeal and a replacement within a month? I think that is a daunting task. This could consumed the entire first 100 days if not beyond Trump's presidency. And they you've got to ask the question, does he have the discipline to stay focused on this through March, April, if it takes that long to do this? I think this is going to be a Herculean task to get through it.
SCHLAPP: I think it's a massive project, but at the same time guess who has a plan. It's actually HHS cabinet nominee former Congressman Tom Price. He is the one that pushed forward this idea of the fixed tax credits, of expanding the health savings account ensuring that you can have a competition across state lines. There is a platform there, there's a framework there for the Republicans to start.
However, there is that sense of disagreement, and Republican leadership will be key in working with Trump to push forward something that would be acceptable to not only the moderate Republicans but the conservative Republicans who want to phase-in -- phase out quickly, in two years, as opposed to three to four years that the other Republicans want.
BAIER: It will be a big battle, no doubt. You mentioned the Supreme Court. One of the biggest things about Obamacare was that Supreme Court ruling. You have an open vacancy and you have the Senate minority leader saying they are going to fight tooth and nail if the person that the president-elect and environment president puts forward is not right. Take a listen to Chuck Schumer on this.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
SCHUMER: It is hard for me to imagine a nominee that Donald Trump would choose that would get Republican support that we could support. So you're right.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: And so you would do your best to hold the seat open?
SCHUMER: Absolutely.
We are initiating a letter, hopefully signed by Democrats and Republicans. This letter simply says to Mitch McConnell and Chuck Grassley, do your job, hold the hearing.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
BAIER: They said multiple times, Chuck, obviously fill the seat, get Merrick Garland in. Hold a hearing. Now he is saying we may try to hold it open.
HURT: Turnabout is fair play in politics I guess. But I think Donald Trump has taught Republicans one thing that is very good, and that is how to fight and take these issues. I think the Supreme Court is a perfect example where Republicans have very much adopted the Democratic notion that it's OK to twist the constitution anywhere you want to without constitutional amendments. And to go back to that original fight and have that fight in public, I think Republicans can win it, and I think Donald Trump will be a very good spokesman for that fight.
BAIER: But quickly, Dave, can Democrats continue to fight on every issue, on every nominee, on everything?
CATANESE: No. Look, Chuck Schumer did a big media tour yesterday and I think a lot of it was for the base to get them fired up, that I'm your new leader and I'm going to fight. He can't keep all these promises. They are in the minority. They are in an even bigger hole in the House. And they don't have the presidency.
GOLDBERG: They have the nuclear option.
CATANESE: Right. And Schumer helped kill the nuclear option. He's not taking credit for that now, but he's saying that was a Harry Reid thing.
But look, I think this was the Democratic base, the donors out there who are still upset about this election, saying we are going to fight. We're going to fight on all these things. We can do the fact-check in three months and see how much he lives up to his word.
BAIER: We invited the Senate minority leader here on SPECIAL REPORT.
Next up, a fact-check on WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange and the back and forth over this intel.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: He's not exactly a bastion of truth and integrity. And so therefore I wouldn't, you know, ascribed to any of these individuals for making comments that it is providing the whole, unvarnished truth.
SEAN HANNITY, FOX NEWS HOST: Can you tell the American people 1,000 present you did not get it from Russia or anybody associated with Russia?
JULIAN ASSANGE, FOUNDER, WIKIELEAKS: We can say, and we have said repeatedly over the last two months that our source is not the Russian government and it is not a state party.
SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM, (R) SOUTH CAROLINA: I hope the president-elect will get his information and trust the American patriots who work in the intelligence community who swear an oath and allegiance to the constitution and not some guy hiding from the law was a record of undercutting and undermining American democracy.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
BAIER: Well, the fight over intelligence as the president-elect gets ready to get an intelligence briefing on Friday, and the leaders of the intelligence community pushing back against some of his tweets. Donald Trump tweeting, ""Julian Assange said a 14-year-old could have hacked Podesta. Why was DNC so careless?"" Also said Russians did not give him the info. Then re-tweets, ""FOX News, Julian Assange on U.S. media coverage. It's very dishonest, more dishonest than anyone knows."" We are back to the panel. It seems clear, Mercedes, that the intelligence community is saying, listen, wait until you hear before you go after us. What about this public back-and-forth?
SCHLAPP: I don't like it. I think that one of the problems with the intelligence community is the fact that they have gone so public, especially around this election time, post-election in pushing forward the theory that the Russians have hacked and have basically said that Trump has been -- that the Russians went in favor of Trump.
I spoke to a former national security advisor, part of the team that basically said that this is not normal. This is not what the intelligence community should be doing. They should not be going public with this information. I think what you're going to find is that there is a chance Trump will hear the word circumstantial evidence, the likelihood, the possibility that this happened, and he's going to need to make his own judgment from there. But Trump going public with this as well, I don't think it's favorable.
BAIER: It is important to point out the history of Julian Assange. This is a ""Times London"" report on the WikiLeaks dangers back in 2010. ""Hundreds of Afghan lives been put at risk by leaking 90,000 intelligence documents because the files identify informants working with NATO forces. In just two hours in searching WikiLeaks archives the ""Times"" found the names of dozens of dozens of Afghans credited with providing detailed intelligence to U.S. forces. They're villages are given for identification and also in many cases their father's names.""
Back in 2010, Donald Trump called that very problematic. Other people went further and said that he should be taken up on charges.
GOLDBERG: I agree with 2010 Donald Trump. I think that a lot of things can be true. The WikiLeaks documents can be truthful. I think we know that they are true. Why ruin such a great platform by discrediting it with false information?
It can also be true that propaganda is true. There's nothing in the definition of propaganda that says it's untrue. Julian Assange is an anti- American radical who detests this country, has said so explicitly and implicitly for years, doesn't mind that he's responsible for the deaths of western allies, who is a ""Russia Today"" host, and the rush by conservatives who moments ago were talking about what a terrible human being he is, simply because it fits the narrative for the Trump administration, is outrageous.
It is not true, by the way -- it's technically possible a 14-year-old could have hacked this, but it's also absolutely true that a 14-year-old did not hack this, because the phishing app they used to get John Podesta was a classic piece of major intelligence gathering statecraft that is mostly used by foreign governments. And it's not used by 14-year-olds or fat guys on their bed.
(LAUGHTER)
BAIER: Charlie, it's getting a lot of pushback inside the intelligence community. There are a lot of people out in America who say the intelligence community has been wrong before. Donald Trump is right to be skeptical and he should push and wait until he gets all the details. I guess it just feels like, for some of these nonpartisan intel folks, that they are caught in the middle.
HURT: Sure, they are. But it kind of reminds me a little bit of the people who are upset about the FBI, Comey being involved in the Hillary Clinton election. It's like well, if you don't want the FBI inserting itself into the election, don't nominate somebody who is being investigated by the FBI.
Donald Trump, I can't disagree with what you all are saying about Julian Assange except that if he were a reporter and didn't hate the country, he were just be a reporter, he would be held up as the next Woodward and Bernstein for getting all of these files. He would be celebrated.
But I do think it's a good thing I think for the president-elect to have this healthy skepticism about the intel. They have gotten things wrong. The weapons of mass destruction was not a slam dunk in Iraq. ISIS was not a jayvee team. All of that came from intelligence sources. So I just think everybody should sort of calm down a little bit right now and wait and see what happens. Let him get these briefings.
BAIER: Dave, we just heard officially that the report is done. The president will be briefed about it tomorrow. Catherine reported some of this earlier that the intelligence officials will go to the president-elect on Friday.
CATANESE: This is going to be the fault line where Trump could get into some real trouble with his own party. John McCain is holding a hearing tomorrow morning about this topic. He's going to have James Clapper, the director of national intelligence, in front of him. I'm sure Donald Trump is going to see it, be watching it, not like it. Maybe tweet about it. And then you've got him going into this private briefing on Friday. And I think Trump has to be really careful. These are Republican hawks that are going to be against him that he needs for his confirmation. McCain already signaled today probably not going to be voting for Tillerson. If he Trump loses two more hawks, maybe Lindsey Graham and Marco Rubio, Tillerson goes down.
BAIER: The House speaker saying ""I think Assange is a sycophant for Russia. He leaks, he steals data, and compromises national security."" So this is not over as far as the story goes.
That's it for the panel. Next up, more highlights from yesterday's swearing-ins.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
BAIER: Finally tonight, the classic moments from the ceremonial Congressional swearing in family photos with vice president Biden and Speaker Ryan just keep on giving. Take a look.
Vice President Biden going in for the kiss. Oh, no, rejected. Rejected by the baby. And then the dab photo form this. Speaker Ryan said, ""do you want to blow your nose?"" That's what Speaker Ryan said. He said ""What is your problem?"" And he finally got it right.
That's it for this SPECIAL REPORT, fair balanced, and unafraid. Here comes Tucker."

The battle over Obamacare begins, both sides strategizing today on the fight ahead. Republicans have the power to repeal President Obama's health care law. Vice president-elect Mike Pence made a trip to the Hill earlier and said it's going to happen.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
MIKE PENCE, VICE PRESIDENT-ELECT: What's clear here is the American people have spoken. They want to see us repeal and replace Obamacare and today my message to the members of congress is that we are going to be in the promise of keeping business. And the first order of business is to keep our promise to repeal Obamacare and replace it with the kind of health care reform that will lower the cost of health insurance without growing the size of government. 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
PERINO: On the opposite side of the aisle, President Obama tried to protect his legacy. He went to the Hill. He met with Democrats to plot a strategy to keep his signature law from being dismantled.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
NANCY PELOSI, HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVE MINORITY LEADER: Republicans say repeal and replace. The only thing that has going for it is alliteration. They have no replacement plan. To repeal and then delay is an act of cowardice.
We have a values debate on our hands. It's very personal in the lives of the American people, and say make America sick again? Is that what the Republicans want to do? I certainly hope not.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
PERINO: Well, Greg, she's got her slogan, make America sick again.
GREG GUTFELD, THE FIVE HOST, FOX NEWS: Looking at that dress, it's like Pepto-Bismol. You know what, I love the fact that they say, you know, all the Republicans, they have no replacement for Obamacare. They have no replacement for Obama. He's like the quarterback that's leaving college and they have nobody to replace him. They didn't think about it for next season.
PERINO: But thankfully he's not moving out of town.
GUTFELD: That's true. He's going to stick around. He's going to be like (INAUDIBLE) infused. He's going to hang out in the parking lot and hit on the younger chicks.
KIMBERLY GUILFOYLE, THE FIVE HOST, FOX NEWS: Somehow I doubt it.
GUTFELD: Look, I do feel bad for President Obama because in a way, he is like somebody who's watching his Ferrari being repossessed and he's looking out the window, and except it's not a Ferrari. It's a pinto about to explode because Obamacare is such a mess. You know, even his press conference tells you how bad big government is.
If Schumer is saying like if you remove one piece of it at all falls apart, it's like a game of Jenga. And if it's that bad, it tells you how bad big government is. That a centralized -- some kind of centralized monstrosity. Once something breaks, it's a calamity whereas in a free market, something else comes along.
ERIC BOLLING, THE FIVE HOST, FOX NEWS: Well that's what they removed. The Democrats removed the one thing that was going to keep premiums down. It was competition. So they took that out and they said you have to have it and what the opposite actually happens.
So you keep -- you're to keep your doctor, premiums are going to come down by $2,500 per year per families. The opposite happened. Doctors fled. You lost your doctor. Premiums went up $2,500 per family per year.
And so the Republicans have said yes, were going to repeal it first. First to repeal then to replace it with something that works for both sides. This makes the most sense and it will include competition across state lines, I'm guessing. Allowing more doctors to come in and paying them more.
So part of the problem is, like a jacked up Medicare system and Medicaid system, that's what Obamacare is. The doctors are saying I'm not going to take Obamacare. I'm going to go private practice, not take Obamacare or I'm leaving completely. So you bring those people back in and that will bend the cost. That will truly bend the cost curve down.
JUAN WILLAMS, THE FIVE HOST, FOX NEWS: Well, I think it's exactly the opposite and in fact I think competition was certainly at play when we saw premium rates skyrocketing previously without Obamacare which is why the Democrats likely to bring it into place.
And what we've seen subsequently is a tremendous drop in terms of premiums paid by people who have -- get health care from their work, from their employers, from their workplace. So, I mean, I don't think there's any question here that's benefit to it --
BOLLING: The premiums should not have risen by $2,500 per year.
WILLIAMS: No, they -- the premiums -- what did I say, Eric? I said about people who get their insurance, which is more than 80 percent of Americans, get their insurance from their employers. Those premiums have gone down at a record rate in terms of the rate of increase so that we --
BOLLING: No, whoa! There's the trick.
WILLIAMS: What's the trick?
BOLLING: The premiums haven't gone down. The rate of increase is going down.
WILLIAMS: Exactly.
BOLLING: Premiums are going up there Juan.
WILLIAMS: No, no, no.
(CROSSTALK)
PERINO: You and Juan just going to have to call it cut.
BOLLING: Of course, right.
WILLIAMS: The rate of increase was 80-something percent. You go down to 30 percent, you say, oh, there's no -- that's a tremendous benefit. In fact in this morning --
BOLLING: It's also inaccurate.
WILLIAMS: -- ""The Wall Street Journal"" there was an op-ed by your friend Ezekiel Emanuel pointing out how -- because I know you despise him. But I'm just saying, pointing out that big companies and people who benefit from those lower rates of increase are numerous.
PERINO: I found that Ezekiel's op-ed a little hard to swallow.
WILLIAMS: Well, I --
PERINO: I mean it came really --
GUTFELD: I didn't even read it like most of America.
(LAUGHTER)
PERINO: That's true.
GUILFOYLE: You can tell.
PERINO: One thing I noticed is that the Republican sort of have a tiger by its tail, right. So, they're going to have to figure out a way to deal with this in a way that is keeping people calm and reassured but delivering the change they voted for.
And you saw that Mike Pence, Paul Ryan, even Kellyanne Conway all being very careful to say we are going to do this responsibly. We don't want anyone who has insurance now to not have insurance. We're going to be careful.
I think that they're trying to just reassure people that they're not going to be without insurance. That's not the goal of this. It's to figure out a way to bring in more competition and bend the cost curve.
GUILFOYLE: And I think they're being honest. I don't think they want people to be without quality health and medical care. I don't think they want people to be struggling and have this whole abyss where they fall into because there's a gap in between.
I think they are being sincere when they say they want to do this in a responsible, respectful way, which is what is required. So , there is something here that really needs fixing. They made a promise to the American people. They have to see it through.
Now, in terms of the tiger by the tail, it's more like they've got a kitten or something by the tail since Schumer is just not that scary. He's on another network last night, making a promise I think that he cannot keep. That he was going to do also his best to delay Supreme Court picks. He's making a lot of promises.
PERINO: Will you play that sound?
GUILFOYLE: Yes, we'll play it now.
PERINO: OK, this is Chuck Schumer last night talking about all the opposition to come against Donald Trump.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY), MINORITY LEADER: Mr. President-elect, you went after both the Democratic and Republican establishments when you ran, but by your cabinet picks in your early pronouncements you seem to be embracing the timeworn, shopworn, hard right. The only way we're going to work with him is if he moves completely in our direction and abandons his Republican colleagues. Ninety to 95 percent of the time we'll be holding his feet to the fire and holding him accountable. But we're Democrats, we're not going to just oppose things to oppose them.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
PERINO: And yet you had Senator Manchin today -- Democratic senator from West Virginia who is up for re-election, decide not to go to the meeting with President Obama because he thought it was too partisan. Listen to this.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
SEN. JOSEPH MANCHIN (D), WEST VIRGINIA: We had the existing outgoing president coming up, speaking on to Democrats today and we had the newly elected vice president coming in speaking in to the Republicans. And I said, you know, we've got to start this dialogue and start building some type of relationships.
So, I said I'm not going to go. It will be counterproductive. I'm just not going to do it. I just did what I felt I was supposed to do and that's basically start building relationships and bringing America together, not letting Democrats and Republicans stay apart.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
PERINO: SO Greg, there's a senator trying to resist the team sport politics of health care.
GUTFELD: Well, I wasn't listening.
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: But anyway, I've got to be honest. No, I was listening.
GUILFOYLE: He's a mature adult in the room that you said looks like Joe Theissman.
GUTFELD: I don't care anymore about Obamacare. It's really hard to talk about it because we all know it's a bad thing. It's a corpse in the room. And it's hard for conservatives because, as a conservative, you should be against pre-existing coverage because, you know, you don't buy car insurance after you get the accident to pay for the accident. The point of insurance is you get it before you're sick. But you can't win on that argument anymore.
BOLLING: But that's why we are talking about it.
GUTFELD: You know what I mean?
BOLLING: You're 100 percent right because the left is painting it like hay, the GOP is trying to take the 20 million people who are now insured, try and take their coverage away and I think that's what this whole meeting was today. Relax, we're not pulling the rug out from underneath your feet, but we are going to revamp and bring competition in. May I throw one more number in --
GUILFOYLE: We are going to pull the bandage off.
BOLLING: Pull the bandage off, right. But here's the other number. So these insurance companies, because they have now gone down in some places where there is one option for an insurer -- one -- no competition. Some there are none, but where there is one they say, look, we'll keep these premiums rising but at a slower rate, but we're going to stick it to you on deductibles.
And that's what exactly what they've done. So, total outlays for health care over the year in annual outlays are still skyrocketing. You're not paying it in that premium. You're paying it when you use health care in the first, I don't know, five or six or 7,000.
PERINO: Which is keeping (ph) people from using it.
BOLLING: Which keeps people from --
PERINO: Which is OK, right. People have skin in the game and they know how much it costs --
WILLIAMS: Exactly. That's why you want that. So you talk about competition. Let's talk about the fact that more and more Americans, they're setting records for the numbers of Americans who are signing up for Obamacare, the Affordable Care Act, right now.
BOLLING: Are they paying though?
WILLIAMS: Yes.
BOLLING: Are they paying customers?
WILLIAMS: Well, yes, there are people who are signing up --
BOLLING: No. Well, the people are signing up and getting it for free or highly subsidized.
GUILFOYLE: Yes.
WILLIAMS: They highly subsidize. Most of Americans are highly subsidized who get Obamacare but that's not the point. The point is people want this - -
GUILFOYLE: It's kind of is the point.
(CROSSTALK)
GUILFOYLE: Somebody has to pay for it.
BOLLING: Who subsidizes?
WILLIAMS: Let me finish for once. So you have -- who subsidizes when you have unpaid tier (ph) when people go to the hospital, they have no insurance, you and me, Eric. So let's talk about something very real. ""The American Medical Association"" says, hey Republicans like Greg Gutfeld, you are so hateful of Obamacare --
GUTFELD: I am not a Republican. I'm not.
WILLIAMS: You said you're a big conservative --
GUILFOYLE: He's not.
GUTFELD: I'm not Republican.
WILLIAMS: All right, big conservatives like Greg Gutfeld. They hate Obamacare. Oh yes, the AMA says, well, can you do something responsible, like tell us what you want us to replace it with -- the tiger by the tail as Dana calls it. And guess what, Republicans -- and this is not like oh, it's a new subject, we just brought this up. Republicans have no idea about how to replace it. Instead they say, well, what we may do is wait two years, three years, four years.
PERINO: No, I don't think that's what they are saying.
WILLIAMS: Oh, that's what they're saying, Dana. Eighteen months to three years at a minimum, all right, at minimum.
GUTFELD: I've heard about choice.
WILLIAMS: Even Rand Paul, Senator Paul -- Republican, says it's irresponsible to repeal without replace.
GUTFELD: Well, the fact is -- OK, number one, Republicans have talked about choice, have talked about competition, private savings accounts, so the idea that they haven't said anything, you're being (INAUDIBLE).
(CROSSTALK)
GUTFELD: And I just heard an apology.
WILLIAMS: Oh, yes, what competition. No competition --
GUTFELD: Competition between state lines.
WILLIAM: Before Obama there was no competition. No competition. Blame Obama. Thanks, Obama.
PERINO: When government gets -- this is what happens and Obama knew it. As soon as the government gets a little bit bigger, it's hard to make it smaller again.
BOLLING: You're forgetting one key aspect of this whole thing. It's going to cost a trillion dollars. It's going to cost the taxpayer a trillion dollars. That's a new cost to taxpayers.
WWILLIAMS: What is going to cost them?
BOLLING: Obamacare.
WILLIAMS: OK, if Obamacare exist --
GUILFOYLE: Why don't you just give a speech about.
WILLIAMS: What you're talking about, you don't even have a price tag because you don't have one.
BOLLING: Thanks Obama.
WILLIAMS: No, here's what you're going to have, Trumpcare. That's what Obama said today when he was meeting with the Democrats --
BOLLING: And we didn't have a free market for health insurance prior to Obamacare.
WILLIAMS: No we have. Of course we did.
BOLLING: No we didn't. No, you can't sell insurance across state lines.
WILLIAMS: Oh, and that was Obama?
BOLLING: New Jersey can't compete with New York.
WILLIAMS: No, that was a pre-existing rule put in by other people.
GUILFOYLE: Well, Trumpcare, you should buy the gold package. That's my recommendation.
(CROSSTALK)
PERINO: The good news is we will be able to talk about this a lot more and Greg, you'll have lots of chances to talk about Obamacare. Coming up, president-elect Trump continues to push back against the intelligence community over Russian hacking findings. His latest jab, when ""The Five"" returns.
GUILFOYLE: U.S. intelligence determine Russia was behind cyber attacks to disrupt our election, but President-elect Trump is still casting doubts. He's openly expressing a lot of skepticism about the findings. He suggests there's been a deliberate effort to delay a briefing on the matter tweeting, ""The ""Intelligence"" briefing on so-called Russian hacking was delayed until Friday, perhaps more time needed to build a case. Very strange!""
While the intelligence community is pushing back. One U.S. Official is disputing this claim saying the briefing had always been scheduled for Friday. And here is more from John Brennan and John Kirby
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP).
JOHN BRENNAN, DIRECTOR OF THE CIA: There is no intelligence community worldwide that has the capability, the expertise, and capability as the U.S. intelligence community. And so I would suggest to individuals who have not yet seen the report, who have not yet been briefed on it, that they wait and see what it is that the intelligence community is putting forward before they make those judgments.
JOHN KIRBY, SPOKESMAN, STATE DEPARTMENT: President Obama and this administration is 100 percent certain in the role that Russia played in trying to sow doubt and confusion and getting involved through the cyber domain into our electoral process. There's no question about that. The information is there and it's rock-solid.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
GUILFOYLE: OK, so, a little bit of conflicting information back and forth but it sounds like Friday is the day. Greg, you're making weird ostrich faces.
GUTFELD: No, well, I've heard and I don't know if it's true.
BOLLING: It is true.
GUTFELD: That John Podesta's password was password. That's like writing your pin number on your debit card --
PERINO: One, two, three, four.
GUTFELD: -- or like -- is it one, two, three? -- or taking the key to your apartment and putting it under the flower pot right next to your door on the front porch. That is not hacking. That's not hacking. That's barely even phishing. Like a terrier could have done that.
GUILFOYLE: All right, so since you said --
PERINO: (INAUDIBLE) going to figure it out.
GUILFOYLE: -- we're going to ask for a little word from your favorite person, Julian Assange. Let's roll it.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
JULLIAN ASSANGE, FOUNDER, WIKILEAKS: We published several Podesta e-mails which shows Podesta responding to a phishing e-mail. Now, how did they respond? Podesta gave out that his password was the word ""password."" His own staff said, ""This e-mail that you've received, this is totally legitimate."" So, this is something a 14-year-old kid -- a 14-year-old kid could have hacked.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
GUILFOYLE: Al right, we're going to have more on that tonight. Part two of the interview with Sean Hannity at 10:00 p.m. eastern and Julian Assange. Do not miss it. OK, so could it be more obvious? Do you even know anybody that has password as their password (ph)?
PERINO: I believe that is true but I just don't trust Assange. I don't like WikiLeaks. I don't defend it. I'm not on that train in any way. But I believe that that is true. That John Podesta has very weak security to say the least or no security. I also believe that Podesta's e-mails are not the reason that Hillary Clinton lost the election.
GUILFOYLE: Also true.
PERINO: And so, there are -- I just feel this is so bewildering. I think that having an argument with the intelligence community in public about what date the intelligence briefing is going to be on is unnecessary. And I'm looking forward to, I think 16 days from now when the new administration is in place and you have hopefully the CIA director will be confirmed by then.
Get everybody in there and calm this thing down because I don't think it's good to have a public dispute between the incoming president and the intelligence community over something like this. I don't think it's necessary.
GUILFOYLE: All right, so Bolling, what do you say about this?
BOLLING: Strike one using password as your password. Strike two --
GUILFOYLE: Password (INAUDIBLE).
BLLING: -- giving it out to a random e-mail request, and strike three, having your staff concur that, oh yes, it's a good one. Don't worry about it. Go ahead and give your password out. It's amazing (INAUDIBLE) and Assange points out that even a 14-year-old -- what?
GUTFELD: Assange could have done it.
PERINO: Well, it's a guy who told him that it was a legitimate email. He said it was a typ.
BOLLING: Oh, it's a typo.
PERINO: He said that he meant to write illegitimate and that it's the thing that keeps him up at night.
BOLLING: I agree with Dana. It's not a good thing to be fighting with your intel community, but I would also like to see that the firm, you know, specific smoking gun evidence that they in fact -- the Russians did in fact hack. And if they did, OK, so --
GUILFOYLE: But we want to know.
BOLLING: -- take appropriate actions. I'm not sure they should be at this point because Dana also appropriately points out that if I didn't have (INAUDIBLE) anyway, so slap them. Do what you got to do. But if we're going to say the Russians are the only ones doing this, we're out of our minds. There are hundreds of them including stage actors who are doing it.
GUILFOYLE: Well, yes, that will be intelligence naivete. Right, absolutely. OK, so do you just wonder the many reasons why Hillary Clinton lost the campaign? The architect of her demise, John Podesta, password, ""password.""
WILLIAMS: I don't know, look, I think that's pretty funny. I agree it's pretty ridiculous. That's no security --
GUILFOYLE: Bad decision making.
WILLIAMS: But it's not, I mean, look, the fact is that his staff told him it was legitimate. Then he does the thing and then it unravels.
GUILFOYLE: But can he figure it out.
WILLIAMS: But that's not the point here. The point here is we have a foreign government interfering in an American election.
PERINO: Right.
WILLIAMS: That's not good stuff. I don't care if you're Republican or Democrat. We should not be tolerating this. You can't book this kind of behavior and then go back and say, well, I don't think this really affected the election. Well, you'll never going to know because guess what, there was one side that had a constant stream of innuendo, rumors, speculations - - did you see this? Can you counter (ph) that? Oh my God, Hillary Clinton, what about the Catholics? What about Podesta and this person? What about Juan Williams and his phone number? I think this is crazy. It is not fear because there was nothing from the RNC, nothing from the Trump campaign and so it makes one side seem like they're quite suspect. You know, I don't know about that Hillary Clinton. I don't know if she's trustworthy. Boy, you should have seen those numbers during her campaign.
BOLLING: Juan may be one distinction we should make is that this is a hack -- alleged hack to the DNC, not a government entity, right. The DNC is a private group. It's not part of the government. It's not funded by the government. So, there is less of a case for the United States to take action against Russia because they had said they didn't hack into the State Department.
WILLILAMS: Wait minute. Hold on, hold on.
BOLLING: They didn't hack into the White House. They didn't hack --
WILLIAMS: Are you kidding me? The Democratic National Committee is part of the government. That's like going back to Watergate and saying, you know that Nixon, so what --
(CROSSTALK)
BOLLING: Right. I'm just saying it carries a difference to -- in my opinion, a different retaliatory penalty.
GUTFELD: Yes. You know what's actually what you should be outraged about, and I hope I don't have this wrong, but Teddy Kennedy. Do you remember Teddy Kennedy commiserating with the USSR and may be the KGB in order to undermine an election? Was it Reagan's re-election or was it Bush? I can't remember this. Somebody at home knows what I am talking about.
GUILFOYLE: (INAUDIBLE)
GUTFLED: No, no, no. But I mean, talk -- there is precedence for this and it was the Democrats and it was Ted Kennedy actually talking to the USSR about undermining an election. I know I'm right. I just can't get the facts right.
GUILFOYLE: Check Twitter. Have your phone over. OK, Dana.
PERINO: The last thing I want to say is that the Democrats are trying to soothe themselves with this notion that Russia interfered in the election. I'm sure that Russia was up to no good but -- so Russia interfered in the election and therefore that's why she lost.
I think they're trying to reassure themselves with that. They're trying to delegitimize the Trump presidency and I think he's right to push back on that. The thing about the e-mails is that the Democrats are not at all taking responsibility for the thing that I think really did lead to the untrustworthy numbers, and that was that she set up her own private e-mail server.
WILLIAMS: Yes, but you can do that. You can say, OK, so she made a mistake, and that's like talking about the charities and say, oh, what about Donald Trump's charities or what about Donald Trump's (INAUDIBLE)? None of that comes out and everybody says --
GUILFOYLE: But they have a war room set up now to attack all of that after the fact, got it? Greg, go ahead.
WILLIAMS: -- yes, none of that comes out. But you know what, but I don't think Dana, to your point --
GUILFOYLE: -- got it? Greg, go ahead.
WILLIAMS: -- I don't think that the Democrats are trying to, you know, calm themselves by saying, oh, it's because of the Russians. I think the bigger point here is foreign governments should not interfere in American elections.
GUTFELD: Ted Kennedy secretly asked the Soviets to intervene in the 1984 elections according to ""The Federalist."" So, it happened before.
PERINO: OK.
WILLIAMS: Not good.
(CROSSTALK)
GUILFOYLE: OK. All right. Thank you for that. And next, some advice from Greg for all the critics out there who wish president-elect Trump would give up tweeting when he takes office. Stay tuned.
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: I wish there was another celebrity video tweeting to sop Donald Trump from running the world. Oh, here it is.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Dear members of congress.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Dear members of congress. I'm mad.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Flabbergasted.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Furious.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Concerned for my children.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I'm worried for everyone.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The majority of Americans regardless of who they voted for --
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: -- did not vote for racism --
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: -- for sexism --
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: -- or for xenophobia. And yet Donald Trump won.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We demand that you vigorously oppose him.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We demand that you block nominees who threaten the rights of women --
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: -- the LGBT community --
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: -- people of color, immigrants and the poor.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: And we want you to know that we are with you.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
GUILFOYLE: This is so ironic (ph).O
GUTFELD: Oh, I want to throw up. That's humanity for progress. The title that seems as legit as good people for peace or thoughtful stars against diarrhea. Typical of the demonizing left. The name Humanity for Progress suggests anyone who disagrees must be inhuman or against progress.
Clearly they are worried. And can you blame them? Donald Trump wakes up, tweets, and then stuff happens. He's on a third rail that they can't touch. It's as if the cool kids are now on the outside looking in, their faces pressed against the glass. It's exactly how half of America felt eight years ago when Obama marched us toward progressive Armageddon, gloating all the way. I guess this is payback. Chucky's response.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
SCHUMER: Making America great again requires more than 140 characters per issue. With all due respect, America cannot afford a Twitter presidency.
We have real challenges, and we have real needs to get things done, and many Americans are afraid, Mr. President-elect, that instead of rolling up your sleeves and forging serious policies, for you, Twitter suffices.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
GUILFOYLE: My goodness. He needs a teleprompter.
GUTFELD: ""Rolling up your sleeves?"" These aging hacks must be the only people left who still say ""rolling up your sleeves."" It's a cry from the diminished and irrelevant. Lost at sea, they cling to the same old baggage rejected by the American public.
Pity. Their side lost two months ago, and they still haven't figured out why. You could tell them it was the endless tantrum of identity politics and the paralysis of will that it caused. It was their own fear of the PC monster that they created and an American public who grew tired of being scared.
That's the hole that they dug, and each celebrity video only makes it deeper.
Do you know what's funny, Eric? It's not like Trump has done anything yet to tick them off. It's like he hasn't -- what has he done?
BOLLING: Well, he has.
GUILFOYLE: Well, he won.
BOLLING: Yesterday -- he won, right. Yesterday, he tweeted twice. One time, he tweeted he got $700 million worth of investments to stay in America instead of going to Mexico. And the second time he tweeted, he got the ethics committee gutting stopped by the Republicans.
GUTFELD: That's what I'm saying. They should like that.
BOLLING: They should absolutely be thrilled with that.
GUTFELD: Yes.
BOLLING: But by the way, the UAW is thrilled with that, as well.
So Chuck Schumer -- again, now we heard Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi in the same day saying, ""We're not going to work with the Republicans. We're going to hold our ground, stand firm.""
Guess what? You're a minority in both houses. It doesn't matter. It really doesn't matter anymore. Elections have consequences. You guys lost.
GUTFELD: You know, Kimberly...
GUILFOYLE: Yes.
GUTFELD: ... I'm worried about some -- half celebrities, I think half religious people in there. I am worried about the celebrities in that video. They're on the verge of panic.
GUILFOYLE: Yes.
GUTFELD: I think they need some kind of intervention. An anti-Trump intervention. A Trump-vention.
GUILFOYLE: They're about to plummet to the D-list.
The problem is it just makes all of them look like sore losers. And they're not in a planet by themselves, and they're not in a country that didn't vote. This country did vote, and they voted for Donald Trump to be the 45th president of the United States.
And the tweets are, in fact, working. He's just taking it directly to the people. So it's a direct pipeline.
GUTFELD: Yes.
GUILFOYLE: Keystone Pipeline to the American people. And they're frustrated. And they don't know how to do the limbo, like go above it, go below it. They don't know what to do.
So then they have Schumer with his head down, with, like, horrible reading skills, looking down. No whatever: charisma, no content, no ability to communicate. So this is actually going very poorly for them. And again: advantage team Trump.
GUTFELD: Chuck, more like upchuck. Am I right, Dana?
PERINO: You're right, Greg.
I was picking up on that, too, that the communication styles are just so radically different.
GUTFELD: Right.
PERINO: So for 16 months, 18 months, people were complete -- even if they didn't want to vote for him, they were entertained...
GUTFELD: Yes.
PERINO: ... by Donald Trump, who doesn't have to speak from a teleprompter. And I think that the more the Democrats focus on him using Twitter and urge him to stop it, he's going to keep doing it, because it's his most effective tool. Why would you do away with your most effective tool?
I think if the Democrats really want to try to beat him, they have to beat him either with ideas or ignore his tweets and figure out a way to work around it.
GUTFELD: It really is...
PERINO: They're not going to beat it.
GUTFELD: You know, Juan, it is a third rail that they can't get to, because when he tweets, the press follows. I think it's a parallel to whenever President Obama did something, the media reacted; and we would sit there and go, ""Why is the media always paying attention to President Obama?"" So this is just fair game. It's just the pendulum has swung back.
WILLIAMS: Well, you know, it's so curious to me. Because you know, as I've said, I feel so old school on this. Because I -- Charles Krauthammer said last night, he said, you know, this works. It's effective.
GUTFELD: Yes.
WILLIAMS: But on the other hand, when you're president of the United States, are you able to actually make a constructive, coherent policy...
GUTFELD: Yes.
WILLIAMS: ... on a tweet? He's going to suggest things on tweet, like for example, when he goes back and forth with the Chinese or whatever. I mean, that's a real consequence. So does he continue?
Now, remember, he said way back, I think right after he won the election, ""I'm going to stop this tweeting. It's not going to go well for me."" But he has continued the tweeting because to me, it's like he's addicted. I think I'm quoting Greg Gutfeld.
BOLLING: Even -- can I jump in?
GUTFELD: Yes.
BOLLING: More so than he's addicted, it's working. It's ticking off the other side. Quick story.
WILLIAMS: I think it's ticking off his side.
BOLLING: First day when I did this at the end of the show, this is ""The Five"" and it made you so mad. I said, ""You know? I'm going to do this every day.""
PERINO; True story.
BOLLING: Because this is what's happening, though.
GUTFELD: It bothered me, because I'd go, ""I know that's a hand, Eric."" You point at the hand.
BOLLING: Twitter is ticking off the left so badly, it's brilliant strategy for him to continue to do it.
PERINO: They should try to match it.
WILLIAMS: Well, I don't know how you match it, because he doesn't use email. So he can't even give away his password. But I'm saying, you know, it's very cute.
PERINO: No. Match his tweet for tweet.
WILLIAMS: No, I don't know if you can match him tweet for tweet. Like this thing about, you know, Trump...
GUILFOYLE: Well, Elizabeth Warren tried.
WILLIAMS: I think it's childish.
Who did?
GUILFOYLE: She tried.
PERINO: She didn't do too bad.
GUILFOYLE: Elizabeth Warren. She didn't do too bad. You're going to put Pocahontas back in.
GUTFELD: All right. That made no sense. I didn't make any sense.
GUILFOYLE: You didn't make any sense.
GUTFELD: I didn't make any sense.
I was going to read this. Is the Black Lives Matter movement responsible for the crime crisis of Chicago and elsewhere? The city's former police superintendent thinks so. Here him explain why when ""The Five"" returns.
BOLLING: There's been a crime crisis in Chicago for quite some time. But in 2016, the violence skyrocketed. Homicides topped 700 for the first time in 20 years. There were 762 murders recorded.
The city's former top cop blames the Black Lives Matter movement for contributing to that staggering tally.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
GARRY MCCARTHY, FORMER CHICAGO POLICE SUPERINTENDENT (via phone): There's a political atmosphere of antipolice sentiment that has swept across this country. A movement with the goal of saving black lives, at this point, is getting black lives taken, because 80 percent of our murder victims here in Chicago are male blacks.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
BOLLING: Here's more from Garry McCarthy explaining exactly what he means.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
MCCARTHY: I never said that Black Lives Matter causes -- is causing people to die. What I'm talking about when I point to the movement, I'm talking about the groundswell that has involved a number of different components.
I talk about the Department of Justice, which does go right to the White House, as -- as being a major component in hamstringing police while at the same time emboldening criminals, which is leading to the lawlessness that we're seeing in the streets of, certainly, many of our major cities across the country.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
BOLLING: But Greg, there are spiking crime rates in Chicago. Other cities, as well, but not the extent of Chicago, my hometown.
I will tell you, the vast majority of the spiking crime -- the murders that are going on are -- there are two big neighborhoods. And they are very much gang-related. They are very much...
GUTFELD: Yes.
BOLLING: Cops, you know, in their defense, if they don't have the mayors behind them, what incentive is there to go in and risk your life and then get called out for the way you engage someone?
GUTFELD: That mayor is so brave. Remember when he came out against Chick- Fil-A, you know, refused to have them come and move to Chicago? But he won't condemn the violence. Because in his head, he somehow must link, you know, talking about gang violence to race. So in a weird way, it might even be racist on his part for not coming up and saying it.
But here's -- you know, I wouldn't blame Black Lives Matter. I would blame the media. CNN, MSNBC, the hyper-focus on police shootings led to the protests against the police, which caused the police to pull back. When the police pulled back, the consequence was energized criminality. Right?
So the protesters who claim to help got the press involved, and that enabled this current bloodbath.
BOLLING: K.G., the murders, the homicides in Chicago exceeded New York and L.A. combined.
GUILFOYLE: Yes, well, obviously, what they're doing is not working. So the less hysteria, screaming and yelling about gun control and guns are bad. It's doing nothing except for littering the streets with more dead bodies.
What they need to do is do basically what O'Reilly talked about, which is put the National Guard there in those specific communities. No, Juan, that's what they need. They need more effective policing to take the illegal guns out of the hands of the drug dealers and criminals and make sure that they enforce actual strict sentencing and do sentencing enhancements, and make them stick. When someone gets caught with a gun like that, tack another five years onto their sentence. That's what actually works.
That's what works in cities that don't have this problem, where they aren't littered with bodies, with record numbers. That is the only thing that Chicago is succeeding in, is lives lost. They are the winner of that. So what does that say?
BOLLING: Let's take a step forward. What could Chicago do to scale back the rising crime rate?
WILLIAMS: Well, from all I can -- I'm fascinated by the story, because to me it's -- to me, it's one of the saddest, most tragic things going on in the country right now. Hats off to Donald Trump for saying it, for calling attention to it.
But the reality is, it's not a matter of putting the National Guard on the streets. What you said, and I thought was very insightful, was it's going on in very specific generally black, Hispanic -- mostly black -- neighborhoods in Chicago, South Side, a couple on the West Side. Very concentrated.
GUILFOYLE: That's what I said. Those communities.
WILLIAMS: Police have said -- that's why I said I don't think it makes a difference. You put -- in fact, the mayor, Rahm Emanuel, that you guys put down, he's put 1,000 more cops out there.
But I think what's going on is it's people who know each other killing each other. I read the other day how, you know, they say they're bored. They don't have a job, whatever. That they -- small grudges become, THEN, something you kill somebody over.
This is a pathology; this is real sickness. But it's endemic now in Chicago to the point that it's out of control. It's like a public health menace.
BOLLING: I don't hear...
WILLIAMS: Can I make one point...
BOLLING: Yes.
WILLIAMS: ... before we go? Garry McCarthy is a good cop, and he's widely respected by police around the country. But do remember...
BOLLING: Yes.
WILLIAMS: ... the reason that Garry McCarthy was let go was because Laquan McDonald, 17-year-old, was shot in the back...
BOLLING: Right.
WILLIAMS: ... by police. There's no disputing this.
BOLLING: Yes. There was the video of that. Yes, he did.
PERINO: I don't necessarily have an answer, but I wanted to ask Kimberly, is like is there -- because of your experience, and especially in California, in Los Angeles, when there was a big gang problem, what helped solve that? It was the same thing here.
GUILFOYLE: Los Angeles and San Francisco, you've got gang task force, and you have them specifically targeting the gangs; and they worked effectively there.
You have to have that sort of militant, you know, approach to be able to do it. Because they are really problematic, and it brings the whole community down. Nobody wants to open up businesses. Nobody wants to go to school. Parents are even afraid for their kids to go down the street or come home after school.
PERINO: Exactly (ph).
GUILFOYLE: Then they're afraid to not be there for them when they come back. And it's cyclical; it's deadly. And they need to do something different. Because what they're doing, Juan, clearly, clearly, there is specific factual evidence that it is not working. And so they need to pick up the pace a bit. This, like, soft approach isn't working.
WILLIAMS: I don't think it's the cops. I think we've got to talk about what is wrong in these communities where the people think it's OK.
GUILFOYLE: You have to make them safe first.
BOLLING: OK. Well, here -- right there. I took my earpiece out again, Susan.
Next, some very awkward moments yesterday on Capitol Hill during the swearing-in ceremonies for the new Congress. Of course, Joe Biden was involved in some of them. We'll show you all that when ""The Five"" returns.
WILLIAMS: Yesterday Vice President Joe Biden and House Speaker Paul Ryan were on hand on Capitol Hill to swear in in the 115th Congress. And whenever Uncle Joe's around, it always makes for an interesting photo op.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Do you want to do a goofy one?
JOE BIDEN, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: You sound like my daughter. Get in here.
Now, you will well and faithfully discharge the duties of the office upon which you're about to enter, so help you God.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I will.
(BABY CRIES)
BIDEN: She's not so sure.
Can I ask you all one favor? Tell him, in 14 days, when I'm no longer vice president, tell him to still say hi to me. You know what I mean?
Does anyone else want to be sworn in?
(END VIDEOTAPE)
GUILFOYLE: Aww.
WILLIAMS: But did Joe Biden get upstaged? Paul Ryan also found himself in the middle of an awkward family moment when a lawmaker's son photobombed Dad's swearing-in with a dab.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
SEN. PAUL RYAN (R-WI), SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE: Are you all right? Do you want to put your hand down?
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: All right.
RYAN: Are you going to sneeze? Is that it?
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes.
RYAN: He's sneezing.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
BOLLING: He's sneezing.
WILLIAMS: So Dana has been trying. Show us your dab, Dana.
PERINO: I can do it.
WILLIAMS: You've got it, girl.
PERINO: I learned that from some kids at Calvary Church...
GUILFOYLE: Look at Greg.
PERINO: ... in Savannah, Georgia, at their school. They asked me if I could dab. I was, like, ""I don't even know what you mean.""
WILLIAMS: That's why I'm so glad...
PERINO: And I did it.
WILLIAMS: ... that somebody's so cool as you.
PERINO: Very hip. I am.
WILLIAMS: But also Greg, did you know what a dab was?
GUTFELD: That's why I don't have kids. Children are the worst combination of, like, ignorance and enthusiasm. They have all this energy, but they don't what to do with it. So they're in this picture, this important moment and he does something so stupid.
I would have punched that kid in the face.
WILLIAMS: Wow.
GUTFELD: I would've dragged him outside, and I would have grounded him for four months.
WILLIAMS: So -- so guess what? So Paul Ryan then tweets, ""I don't even know what dabbing is."" But you're a cool guy.
BOLLING: I don't know. Can you teach me?
WILLIAMS: Oh, stop.
PERINO: It's not that hard. You just did it.
WILLIAMS: Yes, and besides that...
BOLLING: This? Wait a minute.
PERINO: You've got to put your head under.
WILLIAMS: I go to you, Eric Bolling, for all of my coolness.
GUTFELD: This is why I hate kids.
GUILFOYLE: So sad.
BOLLING: Can we show the tape?
GUTFELD: Why I hate children.
PERINO: I think it's like this.
GUILFOYLE: I don't think they dab on ""Special Report."" I'm just saying.
BOLLING: OK.
GUILFOYLE: I'm just saying. Right?
WILLIAMS: Well, did you think...
GUILFOYLE: But I do whip, and I nay-nay. So...
WILLIAMS: Oh, yes. There you go. You're having a good time. You're having a good time.
GUILFOYLE: I mean, what can I say?
WILLIAMS: By the way, what's with the baby who, like, ducked Joe Biden? The baby, like, totally, like, got out of the way.
GUILFOYLE: Oh, the baby threw the head back, ""Aaa!"" because he thought he was going to get a shoulder massage.
WILLIAMS: Uh-oh. Uh-oh.
PERINO: I'm going to miss Joe Biden.
GUTFELD: Yes.
BOLLING: He's...
GUILFOYLE: So am I. Isn't he fun?
GUTFELD: Where is he going?
BOLLING: Delaware.
WILLIAMS: Anyway...
GUILFOYLE: More midnight swimming.
WILLIAMS: ""One More Thing,"" up next.
PERINO: Amtrak.
PERINO: It's time now for ""One More Thing"" -- Juan.
WILLIAMS: Well, thank you. I'm just back from a holiday break, and my family has a tradition during our end-of-the-year getaways. Every year, we sport the same tracksuit as we march through the airports. This time in Baltimore, having breakfast, as we make our trip.
And here we are on the edge of the Emerald Sea, the Caribbean, on Jamaica. Looking fancy in our duds. And here I am in my Snoopy T-shirt with my grandkids. And one highlight of my trip, look at this. I saw a double rainbow out over the ocean. Pretty cool.
PERINO: That is cool. Well done.
Eric.
BOLLING: Nice. Very nice.
OK. So last week we told you about this painting hanging in the U.S. Capitol. This is amazing. It's a painting depicting law enforcement officers holding guns at people. But they're animals, and one of them is a pig. Now, we talked to -- about getting this painting taken down.
GUILFOYLE: Yes.
BOLLING: We called the Democratic congressman, Lacy Clay, from his -- Missouri, his office, who he had it placed after some sort of contest was won.
PERINO: It's a school contest.
BOLLING: Right, a school contest. But he refuses to have that thing taken down. It's still, like...
PERINO: It's a kid's art.
BOLLING: It's a kid's art. But look, over 100 cops were killed in action in America in 2016. I think these cops deserve, these families deserve to have that picture taken down.
And I also think it's -- you want to talk about offensive things. You know, you think a Confederate flag offends people. This offends millions of Americans. Let's call that congressman, Lacy Clay, and have that thing taken down.
PERINO: All right. Greg.
GUTFELD: Time for...

GUTFELD: Greg's Robot News
(END VIDEO CLIP)
GUTFELD: All right. This is pretty interesting stuff. It's -- it's a new companion robot named Curry.
GUILFOYLE: I love it.
GUTFELD: If you're very, very lonely, this little adorable creature is one of the first intelligent domestic robots. It's going to be in a few months, put out by Bot. Costs about 800 bucks.
Now, here's the thing. It's got a built-in camera. So when it's walking around, it's like filming stuff. But because it's so adorable, you really don't think about it. What it's doing right now is it's filming a dog on the couch. Now, the dog thinks he's alone, doesn't know that the frigging robot is a narc. That frigging robot is going to go back and tell their owners that the dog was sleeping on the sofa when he wasn't supposed to. And they're going to put the dog to sleep.
I hate these robots. They're going to destroy the earth. I don't care how cute that thing is. He's going to kill the dog.
GUILFOYLE: They're not going to kill the dog.
BOLLING: Just wait till -- wait till the Russians hack the robots.
GUTFELD: Yes. Dammit.
GUILFOYLE: I can't wait for you to get one of those.
BOLLING: Affect the outcome of your marriage.
GUTFELD: Exactly.
PERINO: K.G., I bet you have a more uplifting one.
No. Meaningful.
GUILFOYLE: Yes, thank you.
God bless the group of teenagers THAT you see pictured here who got together to give a navy veteran a send-off. His body was unclaimed at the funeral home, and there was no one to mourn for him. So what was very nice. Navy veteran Jerry Wayne Pino, who was 70 years of age.
So one of the funeral home directors asked her son to gather boys from his local high school to help. And within minutes, six boys came to carry this war hero's body and lay him to rest. What a wonderful thing. God bless them.
BOLLING: Yes, God bless those boys, too.
PERINO: So very sweet. They are very sweet.
GUILFOYLE: Their families should be very proud.
PERINO: They should. I actually have time to do a ""One More Thing.""
OK, so I have two. Mentoring tips for millennials. Annual tradition of mine.
GUTFELD: Boo.
PERINO: I posted it at FOXNews.com. Five great tips. So check it out.
I also want to pay tribute to Terry Hunt, a good friend of mine. He is an Associated Press reporter, worked for the Associated Press for 46 years. He covered all the presidents from Reagan, to Bush, Clinton, Bush and Obama. Just an amazing guy. I learned a ton from him when I was at the White House. He is got a good friend, Steve Holland, from Reuters. And I have to tell you, as the deputy press secretary, they taught me a ton of things.
That was the briefing room there. That's him there. I should have circled it. Right next to Jim Axelrod there on the right.
GUTFELD: Oh, I see him.
PERINO: And of course, I like to give him a little hard time. You can't see, because of the banner.
BOLLING: He's reading the banner.
PERINO: President Bush talking to Prime Minister Howard and Terry Hunt reading the paper. Anyway, congratulations, Terry. ""Desperado.""

0	37	 38 von 72	Fox News Network	January 4, 2017 Wednesday	 YOUR WORLD WITH NEIL CAVUTO	 4:41 PM EST		"NEIL CAVUTO, HOST: All right. I don`t know if the Ford voter CEO blinked, but Donald Trump tweeted about it.
""Thank you to Ford for scrapping a new plant in Mexico and creating 700 new jobs in the U.S. This is just the beginning. Much more to follow.""
A fellow who is likely very happy about this news is the Michigan governor, Rick Snyder, who joins us from Lansing, Michigan. 
Governor, good to have you. Thank you for coming.
GOV. RICK SNYDER (R), MICHIGAN: It`s great to be back with you, Neil.
Yes, this was an exciting announcement. And it just shows the comeback of Michigan. We won this against other states, all of North America. And it shows, when you have the right environment, you can make job creation really happen.
CAVUTO: Governor, do you think, is Ford just revamping an existing factory there or building a new one?
SNYDER: Well, it`s building next door to an existing factory.
CAVUTO: I see.
SNYDER: But this will be an all-new innovation center.
And so that`s what is so exciting for us, is we led the nation in the creation of manufacturing jobs in the last few years, Neil, automotive sector jobs, because we have got a great environment.
But this is a whole new green field kind of opportunity. And the key things I think are, when you step back and look at it, is, we`re the center of the research and development. Seventy-five percent of the R&D for the industry happens in Michigan.
We`re the center of the supply chain. And we have the most talented work force, because the key when you talk to companies today, you should be asking the question, do you have all the skilled tradespeople, all the talented people you need to work? And they`re looking for people all over the world.
And the good part is, is, we have really made Michigan a focal point to be at the center of that, in terms of having to best people in the world to build the best vehicles.
CAVUTO: Not surprisingly, sir, there are many of your colleagues of both parties in other neighboring states who say that they have the same talented workers.
And so I guess this comes back to Donald trump. Would this have happened without Donald Trump?
SNYDER: Well, again, I think Donald Trump and his focus on pro-growth -- really getting the economy going is a positive in that respect.
But I what say is, is we have natural competitive advantages in terms of, again, 75 percent of the research and development for the entire auto industry happens in Michigan. That`s huge, if you think about it in terms of our country.
CAVUTO: No. No. There`s no doubt amazing what has happened there.
I`m just wondering, though, Governor, because when I asked the Ford CEO about this, he said he would have done this regardless. Do you think that`s true?
SNYDER: Oh, again, I would take him at his word. Ford is a great company. Mark Fields is a great CEO.
The thing is, though...
(CROSSTALK)
CAVUTO: Yet Ford was getting criticized by the president-elect, right, for shipping jobs south of the border.
SNYDER: Yes.
What I would say is, it`s good that we`re all working together, because, again, the way I view it is, it shouldn`t be viewed as a competition between levels of government or who is doing what. The good part is, here we have got an iconic American company.
Ford is a wonderful company. We have got a lot of wonderful companies in the auto industry. We have got a president-elect working with the state, working with all different levels. The local people were fabulous in terms of making this happen down in Flat Rock.
So this is how things should happen, as people partner together to create jobs in our country. That`s the kind of attitude we need. And we need to grow faster in this country. So, let`s all work together. Let`s not make it a competition. Let`s make it a win for all.
CAVUTO: I talked to a lot of these laissez-faire economist types, Governor. And they kind of say to a man or woman, while we welcome American jobs saved and added, the strong-arming part of it or the appearance that Donald Trump would embarrass or tweet out a company and what it`s doing, that`s not the way to go. And that could be a dangerous precedent.
What do you make of that?
SNYDER: Well, again, I think we need to give him a chance to get in office and really look at the policies and practices, because I think there is an opportunity to grow the economy faster.
And I would recommend they look at Michigan as a model. If you step back and look at it, we need tax reform at the national level. We need regulatory reform. We have done this in this state and it`s led to us being number one in manufacturing jobs, number six in job growth in the country after being 50 for how many years, Neil?
You know that. So, you can make a real impact in making a more competitive environment and a better playing field for free enterprise to work.
CAVUTO: All right, Governor, great catching up with you. Happy new year.
SNYDER: Happy new year.
CAVUTO: All right, Governor Rick Snyder, the fine state of Michigan, in Lansing."
0	38	 39 von 72	Fox News Network	January 4, 2017 Wednesday	 YOUR WORLD WITH NEIL CAVUTO	 4:08 PM EST		"NEIL CAVUTO, HOST: One Democrat than didn`t meet with the president today with me right now.
Instead, West Virginia Senator Joe Manchin met with the vice president- elect, Mike Pence.
Senator, good to have you.
SEN. JOE MANCHIN (D), WEST VIRGINIA: Hey, Neil. How are you doing?
CAVUTO: Why did you opt for -- very good, sir -- the vice president-elect, rather than the president?
MANCHIN: Well, here`s how it began. 
I heard yesterday there was going to be this meeting and the president was going to come up and explain. And I said that would be great if we all meet together, get Republicans and the Democrats and hear the president and basically ask questions and go from there.
Well, I found out it was only going to be Democrat Caucus. And I can understand that. But, Neil, I have been here for six years. We`re the second day in to the new Congress with the new president and new staff and new secretaries coming in.
And here we start out in this most partisan way. And really I have said then we had the existing outgoing president coming up speaking only to Democrats today. And we have the newly elected vice president coming in and speaking to the Republicans.
And I said, you know, we have to start this dialogue and start building some type of relationships. So I said I`m not going to go. It would be counterproductive. I`m just not going to do it.
And then I thought I`m going to reach out. If I`m going to be talking about this, I ought to at least be reaching out and seeing if vice president-elect Pence would like to meet with me. I would like to meet with him. So we called, made our arrangements. He`s up here today. I met with him at 2:15. We had a productive very meeting.
We`re trying to find a pathway forward.
(CROSSTALK)
CAVUTO: Was it just you and the vice president-elect, Senator?
MANCHIN: Just me and vice president-elect Pence. Had a great meeting.
CAVUTO: What did your Democratic colleagues think of you deciding to meet with him rather than the president?
MANCHIN: I just reached out. I kept saying it has to be bipartisan. And the president could have reached out. And I`m sure Republicans could have reached out to the president.
Whether he would have met with them or not, I can`t answer that. But I just did what I thought I was supposed to do. And that`s basically start building relationships and bringing America together, not letting Democrats and Republicans stay apart.
He was willing to meet with me. I`m very appreciative of that. We had a very productive meeting. We built a relationship. We exchanged phone numbers. We`re going to keep in touch. I told him my job is to find eight, 10 or 12 moderate Democrats that will work with Republicans in trying to find a pathway forward.
So, whatever they`re going to do, we have got to be able to fix and repair. I have said I`m not going to vote to repeal. I sure do want to help repair in a lot of areas. Show me where we can find that middle and move forward.
That was our conversation. It was healthy, very good. And I`m very appreciative of that.
CAVUTO: All right, but you have heard this pitch that some of your Democratic colleagues have made today to say that Republicans and what they`re concocting is about making America sick again. What do you think of that?
MANCHIN: Well, here`s the thing.
What we`re saying is, we have -- I have heard president-elect Trump and I have met with him and we have a good relationship. And I feel very good about that. I think that we have a working relationship. And we can build on the personal relationship, too, which I think will be very healthy. That`s how this place used to work, Neil. And it hasn`t for a long time.
CAVUTO: I understand that, sir
But maybe I wasn`t clear. What do you think of that pitch that your colleagues have, Republicans are all about making America sick again, that Republicans, anything they`re doing will make Americans sick?
MANCHIN: Well, both sides hype it up. That`s not my...
(CROSSTALK)
CAVUTO: Do you think that`s hyper? Do you think that`s going too far?
MANCHIN: Well, that`s not my repertoire. You know me, Neil.
Basically, when you divide so far and push so far, it`s hard to bring people back. The bottom line is, I have 172,000 West Virginians that have health care now that didn`t have it. I have many seniors that are getting care now through the doughnut hole. I have people on the exchange.
With that being said, we have got to find a pathway forward and how we pay for it. There shouldn`t be winners and losers. I shouldn`t have people in the private sector, small business people like I am, that basically are basically paying double, sometimes 30, 40, 50 percent or more and trying to offset the cost on the other end.
There`s got to be a way to fix that. And the president-elect said he doesn`t want to do away with preexisting conditions. He doesn`t want to do away with the 26-year-old or the caps.
So, those things, if we agree on all that, don`t you think we could sit down and find out how we can preserve the good parts, get rid of the bad parts or repair them to the point they`re more acceptable? That`s all I`m trying to do.
So, I`m not going to say people trying to kill people, people trying make this sick or that. That`s not me. I can`t have a constructive dialogue.
CAVUTO: It`s a pretty crude marketing pitch, is it not?
MANCHIN: Well, both sides. I`m not going to say, because I have seen...
(CROSSTALK)
CAVUTO: But you did mention earlier, Senator, that you think you could maybe rustle up eight to 10 Democrats who could be cobble together as part of a bipartisan coalition to fix this.
Is that a realistic goal? Because, as you know, the health care law came to being without a single Republican vote.
MANCHIN: Well, here`s the thing.
That`s what I think is so bad about that. And I have told them, I said if you haven`t learned anything, learn from the mistakes Democrats made in 2009. I wasn`t there. Neil, I don`t know if I could have voted for the way the bill was presented, because I didn`t like the mandates, forcing people to buy something they don`t want and don`t need.
With that being said, it passed with not a Republican vote. But I told my friends on the Republican side, now you`re going to repeal without a Democrat vote. And don`t you think we could find the bad parts that we really don`t like, the things that have really caused some problems with people in their everyday lives and fix that before you repeal it?
Because here`s the thing, Neil. Whatever you repeal with 51 votes, and you want to put back in place, more than likely, it will take 60 votes to do it. And as toxic as this atmosphere is, until we start building some cohesion, it is going to be hard to get anything repaired or replaced that you repeal.
CAVUTO: All right. Senator Manchin, very good catching up with you. Happy new year.
MANCHIN: Hey, Neil, same to you.
CAVUTO: Senator Joe Manchin of the fine state of West Virginia."

CAVUTO: Looking at what has happened now and the fact that so many people are angry now, would you say that it didn`t work out as you wanted?
REP. JOHN GARAMENDI (D), CALIFORNIA: Actually, we knew from the very outset that there -- through time there would need to be changes made to the law. 
(CROSSTALK)
CAVUTO: Yes, I remember people telling me get ready for double-digit increases, get ready for eye-popping deductibles. I don`t remember it being sold that way. I could have missed something.
GARAMENDI: Well, actually, Neil, if you had been -- and I know you were listening -- before the Affordable Care Act occurred, there were in fact double-digit increases every year, way beyond the general rate of inflation across the United States, usually two to three times greater than the general rate of inflation.
(CROSSTALK)
CAVUTO: You know what? I never, ever remember a year where scores of states were dealing with premiums going up at a triple-digit rate. I don`t remember that ever.

As a former insurance commissioner, if you went back to voters in your state and elsewhere and let them know that it`s eye-popping increases now, you are still going to be looking at eye-popping increases, they might not be as eye-popping as they are now, but they are going to be eye-popping, and in some cases they are going to be ridiculously eye-popping, do you think this thing would have passed?
GARAMENDI: Actually, what I said then and what I have said today is that, as a result of the Affordable Care Act, we have seen a reduction in the rate of increases of health care. There`s absolutely no doubt that health care continues to increase substantially above the rate of inflation.
CAVUTO: And we`re bragging about the rate of increases not being what they were, even though that`s not borne out in state after state after state.
GARAMENDI: No, no, no.
CAVUTO: We`re bragging about the fact that costs are growing up, but they would have gone up a lot more without this law. You simply cannot prove that.
GARAMENDI: Yes, I can.
I can go back to the statistical analysis that has been set in all of the insurance across the United States and in the general health care across the United States and show you...
(CROSSTALK)
CAVUTO: But you`re bragging about an increase that would have been a lot more had we not had the health care law.
GARAMENDI: Absolutely true. It happens to be true.
CAVUTO: What do you tell folks in Arizona? What do you tell folks in Georgia? What do you tell folks in North Carolina? What do you tell folks in Texas?
GARAMENDI: Well, what I tell folks in those states is that their governor did not set up a proper insurance exchange. And because there was no insurance exchange set up...
(CROSSTALK)
CAVUTO: You`re down to two now, because these exchanges were such a marvel.
GARAMENDI: No, the exchanges have actually worked well across the gamut of the United States, not everywhere.
CAVUTO: They`re going out of business faster than me passing up fruit at a buffet. What are you talking about?
GARAMENDI: That`s not the -- in certain parts where there are anomalies in the insurance market, where those exchanges were not broadly based, where there are very few insurers that are working in the exchange, yes, there are clearly problems.
And in my own state of California, the exchange has been unable to overcome the reality...
(CROSSTALK)
GARAMENDI: Wait a minute.
CAVUTO: You`re a good man and a patriot.
I just want to know, will you work with Republicans to fix what you don`t like in this and some of the provisions that might have surprised you on the cost upside, let`s say? Will you work with them?
GARAMENDI: I`m going to answer that two ways.
First of all, absolutely, yes. I have offered over the years, as have the Democrats since the institution of the ACA, to work with Republicans to fix the known problems. That didn`t happen. The Republicans refused to do that. Over 60 times, they simply set about repealing it or gutting it in one way or another. Yes. The answer is that.
CAVUTO: Well, they did have alternatives, as you know. They were just ignored, too. Both sides were childish.
GARAMENDI: No, that`s not -- what was the alternative, was to kill it, gut it and then bring back what? Selling insurance across lines, across state lines? That doesn`t solve anything at all.
(CROSSTALK)
CAVUTO: It`s a start.
GARAMENDI: It opens the door to rampant -- no, no. Depending -- the way they proposed to do it, it opened the door to rampant fraud and insurance companies that did not have the substantial backing to pay the bills.
CAVUTO: And you don`t think we have rampant fraud now and cost gouging going on now?
GARAMENDI: Of course we have fraud across the United States. Of course, there`s gouging across the United States.
But there`s a framework in place called the Affordable Care Act that does provide for the regulation of insurance rates for the first time.
Now, you repeal, you repeal the Affordable Care Act, and the regulation of insurance rates is gone.

MIKE PENCE, VICE PRESIDENT-ELECT OF THE UNITED STATES: The first order of business is to repeal and replace Obamacare.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Blockbuster brawl over President Obama`s signature legislative achievement.
SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D), NEW YORK: To cut healthcare wouldn`t make America great again, it would make America sick again.
STEVE KORNACKI, MSNBC: Vice President-elect Mike Pence and President Obama both going to Capitol Hill today.
BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Look out for the American people.
SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY), MAJORITY LEADER, SENATE: We`re going to move forward with the Obamacare repeal resolution first, and we`ll take the second step a little bit later.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What on earth is he talking about?
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I think the details are still very unclear at this point. Do we know --
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: To everyone, apparently.
REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA), MINORITY LEADER OF THE UNITED STATES HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES: To repeal and then delay is an act of cowardice.
SEN. CHRIS MURPHY (D), CONNECTICUT: Republicans were lying to you when they said they were going to replace it.
REP. PAUL RYAN (R-WI), SPEAKER, UNITED STATES HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES: We have a plan to replace it. We have plenty of ideas to replace it.
SCHUMER: Our Republican colleagues don`t quite know what to do. They`re like the dog who caught the bus.
PENCE: The simple fact is the American people know who owns Obamacare. It`s the first half of the title.
MURPHY: Oh, no, they own this, if they want to break this, they own it.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
MELBER: Today Vice President-elect Mike Pence told House Republicans the new administration will begin dismantling President Obama`s policies on day one, literally.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
PENCE: It will literally begin on day one. Before the end of the day, we do anticipate that the president-elect will be in the Oval Office, taking action to both repeal executive orders and also set into motion through executive action policies to implement promises that were made on the campaign trail.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
MELBER: And the focus is, of course, on Obamacare.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
PENCE: The first order of business today and for the president-elect, and I am grateful for the leaders of the House and the Senate is to keep our word to the American people.
To repeal and replace Obamacare with healthcare reforms that again, will focus on lowering the cost of health insurance without growing the size of government.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
MELBER: Now notice that Pence used a very key term there, R&R, repeal and replace. But there is no consensus right now among Republicans about that critical second R.
House leaders propose focusing on repeal now and delaying implementation, figuring out the actual replacement, the second R later.
Now there is no obvious ideological line to all this. This is more a line about responsibility.
Look at Congressman Mark Meadows, for example, he leads the very conservative house freedom caucus.
But he has said recently that the plan should be repealed and replaced. And all of that should be done in the 115th Congress, ""not left to a future Congress to deal with.""
Or look at Rand Paul, a very conservative libertarian saying he will vote against any GOP plan that does the easy part of repealing without tackling the hard part of replacement.
Now, you can tell it`s the hard part by the way, the topic threw Paul Ryan right off his game at today`s news conference with Mike Pence.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Why still no plan to replace it?
RYAN: We have a plan to replace it. We have plenty of ideas to replace it. And you`ll see as the weeks and months unfold what we`re talking about replacing it.
How we can get better choices with lower prices by not having the cost of government take over healthcare, which is causing all this problem in the first place.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
MELBER: The key part there is plenty of ideas for replacement. Ideas are nice.
But this is a law. It has over 2,000 pages of statutory text. That`s a point Republicans used to cite all the time. And we looked it up, it has another 10,000 pages now of executive rule making.
You can`t amend and replace with plenty of ideas. You have to write out your own plan, show people what they`re voting on, and see if you have the support for it. Congressional Republicans know that, even if they want to pretend this is more simple.
But does their incoming president know that? Unclear. Today, as Congress convened and these actual questions started piling up, Trump showed Republicans why it is not that helpful to bring tweets to a regulatory fight.
Donald Trump didn`t offer leadership on that big question today. Instead offering vague, fairly pundit-like advice that the GOP must be careful while taking on Obamacare.
""Republicans must be careful and that the Dems own the failed Obamacare disaster with its poor coverage and massive premium increases.""
And Trump added, ""don`t let the Schumer clown out of this web. Massive increases of Obamacare will take place this year, and Dems are to blame for the mess.
It will fall of its own (AUDIO GAP 00:00:58-00:01:01)."" Now, if you take Trump at his word, fall off its own weight makes it sound like he backs leaving Obamacare in place -- its own weight.
That`s also what he implied as you may remember it in that ""60 Minutes"" interview after the election.
But as ""Esquire"" writer Charlie Pierce has observed, nobody speaks for the president-elect, not even himself.
No one really knows where Trump stands on the GOP`s Obamacare dilemma right now, and that may include Donald Trump.
Joining me now for more is Ken Vogel; chief investigative reporter for ""Politico"", Ana Marie Cox; senior political correspondent for ""MTV News"" and Howard Dean; former chairman of the DNC and Msnbc political analyst.
And for anyone who`s forgotten, a doctor. So, I`ll start with you, Dr. Governor Dean, your response to everything we just heard.
HOWARD DEAN, FORMER VERMONT GOVERNOR: Well, first of all, it`s pretty clear to me that Paul Ryan, who used to be well respected, has no idea what he is talking about.
He is ideologically motivated. He is grasping around. You can`t replace any part of the insurance function of Obamacare with some ideological crackpot scheme and that`s what he is trying to do.
And it can`t be done. So they`re of course -- they`re going to replace and then never going to get around to repealing and they hope that nobody is going to notice until after the congressional election.
But I think they will, and I think the argument about who is going to wear it is pretty clear, it`s not going to be the Democrats.
MELBER: Ken, how about that?
KEN VOGEL, CHIEF INVESTIGATIVE REPORTER, POLITICO: Well, I mean, I think that in fact the Paul Ryan has put forward plans, a variety of plans to replace Obamacare.
But he doesn`t necessarily have buying from his full conference. And that`s really where you get into the problems here.
Not just with the Obamacare issue, but with a number of the other top agenda items for Donald Trump, including his infrastructure spending plan is that you already see fissures among the House Republican conference.
You saw it on that Office of Congressional Ethics fiasco where the leaders didn`t want this gutting of the independent ethics oversight agency within Congress.
Yet members of Congress -- members of the House Republican conference pushed it anyway and then they stepped back from it amidst the outcry.
And you know, Trump is sort of trying to lead with the -- you know, by going on Twitter and cowing them or suggesting that he has different proposals.
But in this Obamacare instance specifically, there is just no consensus. And I think that it puts them in a box because they have promised now that they`re going to repeal it and they don`t have the replacement.
Twenty million people`s healthcare is at stake.
MELBER: Right, I mean, Ana, it`s not an original thought to note that Donald Trump wants into the conversation whether or not he has something to say.
(LAUGHTER)
But I will point out that while the Republicans are struggling with what I was calling the R&R, and whether there is a replacement, this will matter a lot to Trump.
Because if you take a look at the states that have the highest Obamacare enrollment, all of the top five states right here are all states that voted for Donald Trump.
So, kicking people just off the roles if that were the plan without a replacement is something that he`s going to notice politically.
ANA MARIE COX, MTV NEWS SENIOR POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes, this is a really fascinating sort of time for the rubber to meet the road for Trump I think.
We all kind of know that Trump has no ideological core, that he kind of just does what he thinks seems right or sounds good or is the most popular thing in the room at the moment.
And I think he`s about to find that the people who voted for him don`t want Obamacare repealed. That the most unpopular thing about Obamacare among people who voted for Trump is that it`s called Obamacare.
They like about everything else with it. I think that probably what we might see is sort of some cosmetic changes and then throwing his own name on it like he`s done with buildings before.
I think that, you know, when we hear him and Kellyanne Conway talk about what they think should be replaced, should replace Obamacare, what they want to do is keep all the good parts and then get rid of the stuff that sounds bad.
Which I think any actuary would tell you, you can`t actually do that. So, I wonder if we`re going to see much change at all.
Or if he will sort of have to cave to people who say they have ideas but really, again, I think with even the Republicans in Congress, the most unpopular thing about Obamacare is that it`s called that.
Their plans aren`t that much more popular if you look at them.
MELBER: Well, and to that point, Governor Dean, the thing that the White House used to say under Obama, that sometimes sounded like a rationalization was, well, yes, you see the numbers on Obamacare has taken a hit.
But if you look at the ingredients, it`s really popular. That always felt like a little bit of a rationalization politically, right?
And they had to run with it as it was. Now from a policy perspective, it`s not a rationalization, it`s literally the undercurrent for all of these questions, right?
These questions of what do you really want to change? And so, Governor Dean, on the screen --
DEAN: Right --
MELBER: We`re going to put it up here, staying on the parents plan under Kaiser family foundation polling 85 percent support.
I mean, what do 85 percent of Americans agree about anything right now? Financial subsidies, 80 percent.
The state option to expand Medicaid which is federalism, do it or don`t, you have the option, 80 percent.
Pre-existing conditions, I actually would have thought this was higher. But 69 percent still very high.
And the mandate that businesses of a certain size, 50 plus, which is where they made the small business cut-off, 60 percent, Governor Dean?
DEAN: Well, I don`t know if this came from the same poll, but I saw -- I saw also a poll tonight that showed that 26 percent of Americans believe that Obamacare ought to be repealed, 26 percent.
These guys -- these guys cannot get out of their own way. They`re -- that`s what I meant before when I said they`re ideologically driven.
They`re not driven by practicality or even understanding healthcare. One of the things that could happen if they go ahead with this budget reconciliation reversal of Obamacare is that the insurance company, a lot of people have talked about this.
The insurance -- the individual insurance market could essentially fall apart immediately.
MELBER: Right --
DEAN: Because they can`t eliminate the subsidies and budget reconciliation. There`s a lot of things they can`t do.
So, the problem is they have no guide post. Nothing -- no idea what they want to do except for something from -- you know, the Heritage Foundation or something which makes no sense at all.
They`re ideologically driven. They don`t care what the facts are. You can`t run anything, including the country if you don`t care what the facts are.
MELBER: Well, you`re making such an important point that dovetails with what Ana was talking about that there is a void because Trump doesn`t have a center, right?
So, if Trump is sort of the Caramelo Candy bar here, and it`s all really soft Caramelo, no core to use your words on that.
(LAUGHTER)
Then what are we -- what are we dealing with? I mean, we`ll put up just one example, I think they`re well-known.
But Trump in May, right before he announced for this long shot bid that actually resulted in him winning the presidency, he said, by the way, I was the first and only potential GOP candidate to state there will be no cuts to Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid --
DEAN: I saw that.
MELBER: Huckabee copied me, Ana?
COX: Well, you know, I think sometimes we kind of forget that when we talk about Trump, that what made him popular is his -- I mean, he`s a populist, right?
Like we sort of threw that term around, and if you want to be a populist, you`ve got to do stuff that`s popular.
And he thrives on that, then I think this is a case where he is going to find that his -- the ideological opposition in Congress is going to go up against what he thinks is the most popular thing to do.
What you know, the number one answer in family feud is. And I think he is probably going to try to figure out a way to have everything.
I don`t know how that will work. I do know that anyone who goes into business with Trump winds up getting embarrassed.
And I think that`s going to be what happens to the Republican Congress members.
They think they can push him around, but he is a master manipulator, and he is a master of being the person who looks good when the deal falls through.
And I think that`s what we`re going to see here.
MELBER: Ken, can you bridge us from family feud to Caramelo and your final thoughts.
VOGEL: Well, I think so. I mean, I do think -- I agree that Trump is going to sort of go for where he sees the easy victory, and the victory which he could sort of take the most credit for.
But I do think that there are Republicans in the house conference in particular who do have an ideological core and do believe that Obamacare is problematic and do look at things that Trump himself cited on the campaign trail.
Like this skyrocketing premiums and say that they want a replacement and do have ideas about what that replacement should be.
And are not going to be satisfied if Trump merely tries to paper over some stuff and put his name on it and say hey, we fixed things.
So, that`s where there`s going to be a problem, is when Paul Ryan --
MELBER: Yes --
VOGEL: Tries to bring along --
MELBER: Right --
VOGEL: The House conservatives to something that Trump might like, and they`re just going to dig in their heels and say no.
MELBER: Ken Vogel and Ana Marie Cox, thank you both for joining, Dr. Dean stays. Coming up next, is obstruction a good political strategy?
Why are Democrats thinking about biting Mitch McConnell`s style? And later, the blue states determined now to stop the Trump administration policies in court.
Well, they just picked up an all star for their team, we`ll tell you who it is, coming up.
MELBER: Now coming up, should the Democrats do what congressional Republicans did to Barack Obama and simply obstruct the Trump agenda? That debate is next.
MELBER: I want to let you guys in on a little secret in politics, though you may have already noticed it.
Politicians love to make things seem important by pretending they`re unprecedented or one-of-a-kind.
And you noticed the last few elections we`ve been told they were the most important of our lifetime, like each one in a row.
And there have been obviously many such moments in the Obamacare wars. I fully admit. But I will tell you this, today there actually was a pretty unusual inflection point in this debate.
President Obama left the White House in the middle of a transition period where he`s offered a lot of cooperative and classy outreach to the incoming president.
And he huddled with Democrats on the Hill to explicitly try to thwart Donald Trump`s Republican Party attacks on Obamacare.
And our reporting today suggests this was no photo op. We can tell you the president spent two hours in that private meeting advising Democrats to give up no turf in this fight to make Republicans own any changes made to the law.
And to brand any new diluted healthcare plan, ""Trump-care"". That`s what Obama said according to the meeting.
Now this summary is from anonymous leaks from inside the room. But we also got a snapshot today on the record on Msnbc from Senator Chris Murphy.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
MURPHY: I think he wanted to make it very clear to us that we shouldn`t be -- you know, we shouldn`t be under the illusion that the majority of Americans want this thing to go away.
They want it to be made better. And right now the Republicans are at risk of losing this fight by repealing it without any offer of replacement, which turns the whole healthcare system into chaos.
Republicans were lying to you when they said they were going to replace it. And his message I think today was you have to hold them to that promise that they made.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Did he seem fired up?
MURPHY: You know, I think he was the no drama Obama that we`re used to. I mean, he`s -- at the very end he said, you know, listen, don`t mistake my cool demeanor for a lack of outrage, right?
I`m angry just like you are about what has happened in the election and after the election.
And I think you could sense that he -- you know, is you know, maybe feeling a little forlorn that he is not going to be in this fight --
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes --
MURPHY: In the way that we are.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
MELBER: Joining us now Eugene Robinson; Pulitzer Prize-winning columnist for ""The Washington Post"" and of course an Msnbc political analyst.
And back with us is Governor and Dr. Dean. Eugene, your thoughts here, the president has done a lot that`s been noticed to have what`s called a smooth transition.
This seems like one of the most public moments where he`s drawn a line, met with the Democrats and said we`ve got to protect this.
EUGENE ROBINSON, COLUMNIST, THE WASHINGTON POST: Yes, I thought it was fascinating that he actually went to the Hill to sort of buck up the troops and say look, you know, here is the line and let`s hold this line.
And you know, in practical terms, I think that`s what the Democrats plan to do, because it`s kind of the obvious thing to do.
If you want to repeal Obamacare, go ahead and do it, but it`s yours at that point.
And I can`t imagine the Democrats helping to put in place some sort of sub- standard and inefficient plan that`s you know, based on imaginary free market principles instead of real any kind of principles that doesn`t work.
MELBER: Well, that`s the fear. I mean, the last time you had a new Republican administration, none other than Ted Kennedy was making common core with George W. Bush.
Now, we are worlds away, but there is a fear out there that sooner or later prominent Democrats may want to make deals.
Governor Dean, take a listen to Chuck Schumer also describing the meeting with President Obama today.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
SCHUMER: He was very inspiring. Telling us we worked out -- we were working out our strategy, and we have a great deal of optimism that the good things that have happened in ACA are going to stay.
And that our Republican colleagues don`t quite know what to do. They`re like the dog who caught the bus.
They can repeal, but they have nothing to put in its place, and that means so many good things go away.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
MELBER: So, Governor Dean, from what you`re hearing there to Gene`s point, are we seeing a calcifying of the Democratic backbone?
DEAN: They could use one historically. Look, I mean, I think our position will be somewhat different than the Republicans.
I think what Schumer has said in other venues is sure we`ll work with Trump.
If he comes in with a tax reform plan that actually does something for middle class people, except -- unlike what he`s sort of proposed already.
Or if he comes in with an infrastructure plan that puts people to work, of course we`re going to work on that.
But there is no reason, and it`s not obstruction to oppose crackpot ideas or Supreme Court nominees who are so far right that they don`t belong on the bench.
And I -- we shouldn`t compromise one inch on that. I can remember when I ran for president, it was because the Democrats voted for Bush`s tax cuts, which put us into a huge deficit and to send us to Iraq.
Which Trump supported despite the many times he`s pretended he hasn`t. You can`t be -- if you`re the minority party, you`ve got to stand up for what you believe in or you believe in nothing.
MELBER: I mean, on a personal note, I was working in Iowa when you were running for president.
I remember being at some of the crowded events where people would kind of get as excited about your criticism of the DNC as they would about anything else, right?
There was a particularly strong critique of Washington Democrats. Gene, on that point, the governor also mentions the Supreme Court.
I want to play for you what we talked about earlier. Chuck Schumer really saying they`re going to go hard on the Supreme Court nomination if it`s not mainstream.
They`ll leave the court vacancy open, this was with Rachel last night.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
SCHUMER: We are not going to settle on a Supreme Court nominee. If they don`t appoint someone who is really good, we`re going to oppose them tooth and nail.
Now, then, they won`t have 60 votes to put in an out of the mainstream nominee. It`s hard for me to imagine a nominee that Donald Trump would choose that would get Republican support that we could support.
So, you`re right.
MADDOW: And so you would do your best to hold the seat open?
SCHUMER: Absolutely.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
MELBER: Gene, what did you make of that?
ROBINSON: Well, that`s pretty much the position of the out of power party for umpteen years now.
Which is that if you put in a far right, or if Republicans are out of power, a far left nominee for the court, we`re not going to support and we`re going fight it tooth and nail and we`re going to deny you the 60 votes.
And certainly what has happened with the last couple of presidents. So, if you nominate somebody closer to the middle or somebody we find acceptable, then maybe some of us will vote for him.
And I think that`s kind of the way it`s going to be, given Trump`s list of potential nominees, they`re pretty far to the right.
So, I think what Chuck Schumer said would happen indeed is going to happen.
MELBER: Yes, we`ve looked at some of them. A lot of those nominees are from the Heritage Foundation list.
If you go much farther to the right than that, you don`t find people who are currently judges, is one way to look at it. Gene Robinson and Howard Dean, thank you both for joining us tonight.
DEAN: Thanks a lot, Ari --
MELBER: Appreciate it. Paul Ryan saying he expects Donald Trump to become better informed about Russia after his big intelligence briefing which is scheduled for this Friday.
Trump though continuing to rely on a range of sources including, yes, Julian Assange as an authority on those 2016 cyber attacks.
Also later, a conservative leveling a shocking attack on one of Congress` most trusted non-partisan institutions.
MELBER: We have some breaking news on the Russia story tonight. ""Npr"" reporting that a declassified version of the Russia intelligence report by the U.S. now expected to be released to the public by Monday afternoon.
There`s been a lot of questions about when that would come out of Donald Trump`s war and battles with the U.S. intelligence community did continue in earnest today.
He posted on Twitter that Julian Assange said a 14-year-old could have hacked Podesta, why was DNC so careless?
Also said Russians did not give him the info. Also tonight though, another report that`s getting some traction that you might want to know about.
This is in The Wall Street Journal. And it`s about Trump`s proposal to reform intelligence agencies. The very agency heads that he is meeting with this week. Here is what The Wall Street Journal is reporting that Trump is working with top advisers on a plan that would restructure and pare back the nation`s top spy agency, prompted by a belief that the office of the DNI has become bloated and politicized.
This is what Rachel was mentioning at the end of her hour. Now Trump has repeatedly claimed the intelligence on Russia is faulty. This is a far cry from his antipathy towards Russia just two years ago based on intelligence or public reporting or something because he wrote ""Romney strongly stated in one of the debates with Obama that Russia is the big problem Obama`s got -- Mitt was 100 percent correct."" Also he wrote, this is two years ago.
""The situation with Russia is much more dangerous than most people may think and could lead to WORLD WAR III."" Joining me now is Evan McMullin, a former CIA operative and former independent presidential candidate as well as Charlie Sykes, editor-in-chief of Right Wisconsin an MSNBC contributor who is writing a book ""How the right lost its mind."" Let me start, though, Evan, with you. What do you make of The Wall Street Journal report?
It is interesting. Also, the context is there are republicans apart from Donald Trump who have talked about reforming DNI. There`s nothing wrong I would stipulate with any incoming administration taking a hard look at the organization intelligence community, at the funding. We spend $17 billion plus a year. What seems to be problematic is that being roped into a tit for tat about power and the impugning of the work these people do before he has even met with them in this big planned meeting Friday.
EVAN MCMULLIN, FMR. CIA OPERATIVE, FMR. INDEPENDENT PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Yes. Ari, that`s exactly right. It`s totally fine for an incoming president to consider a range of reforms across agencies and departments. I would certainly encourage that of any incoming president. In this case, though, that very Wall Street Journal article also says that Donald Trump and some of his advisers I think -- I`m not sure that this is actually true about his advisers. But the report says this is nonetheless, that Donald Trump, and they believed that the CIA is trying to undermine Donald Trump`s victory, his election victory.
And that that`s part of the motivation perhaps to these so-called reforms of the intelligence community. I would point out that it is absolutely textbook for a strong man to come in and attack not only the media. They do that. But also intelligence and security services, try to weaken them, try to consolidate power within them. I mean it`s absolutely textbook.
And I have to say as a former intelligence officer myself, seeing his attacks on the press and then reading this report tonight really has me greatly concerned. Perhaps more concerned than I`ve been all along.
MELBER: Yes. Wow. Wow. Charlie, go ahead.
CHARLIE SYKES, EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, RIGHT WISCONSIN: No, I mean, he`s absolutely right. Over the last 24 hours, you see Donald Trump taking Julian Assange at his word and mocking American intelligence agencies. And now looking like he might retaliate against them for blowing the whistle on the Russians, look, if this was a monologue from Rush Limbaugh, it would be bizarre but coming from the incoming president of the United States, it is genuinely alarming.
And I agree with Evan about all of this. That I see the pattern here of Donald Trump trying to delegitimize any institution that might be a check on him whether it is the news media or the intelligence community and I do think we ought to connect the dots between those two things. He does not want these independent agencies who might actually be a truth detector on his administration.
MELBER: Well, you`re both putting your finger on something that is all the more disturbing when we`re talking about an individual who has no public service or government experience whatsoever. We know he`s popular with voters even before this election cycle to have newcomers to Washington. But this is more than a newcomer. This is someone who doesn`t seem to appreciate how these things work, what these checks and balances are, as you both understand, the fact that becoming president gives you extra power, but also gives you extra limitations, constitutional limitations.
That`s part of the balance. I want to play Paul Ryan today reacting to some of this and sounding sort of wishful that somehow this will all change by Friday once Trump is briefed.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
REP. PAUL RYAN (R-WI), SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE: I think he is not received this Russia briefing yet. I believe that`s scheduled for Friday. So hopefully he`ll get up to speed on what, you know, has been happening and what Russia has or has not done. And he will be better informed on that.
HUGH HEWITT, AMERICAN RADIO TALK SHOW HOST: Then let me ask you what your opinion is of Julian Assange?
RYAN: I really have none other than I think the guy is a sycophant for Russia. He leaks. He steals data and compromises national security.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
MELBER: Evan?
MCMULLIN: Well, look, I have a lot of respect for Speaker Ryan. I think he is a patriot and a statesman. I want to say that I think it would be misguided for any of us to assume that Donald Trump is pursuing these activities just out of naivety. That is just not the case. Donald Trump understands exactly what he is doing. And Charlie was exactly correct when he said earlier about his targeting of other sources of power, agencies and the press who might keep him in check. That`s what he is doing.
He knows what he is doing. This isn`t a matter of Donald Trump being better informed and than therefore changing course. He knows what he is doing and that`s what we need to be concerned about. And that`s what we need to oppose.
MELBER: And Charlie, briefly, what do you want to see come out of this Friday meeting?
SYKES: Yes. Well, you know, I do think that Speaker Ryan`s comments, the triumph of hope over experience, you know, and I`m hoping that not only do we get a president who actually has more of a reality check, but I hope that when we see the declassified report that it really clarifies. Because, look, you know, I`m going to say this over and over again. This is another check -- I mean another test for conservative republican patriots. This is one where, you know, they`re going have to be willing to break with the president on this because the stakes are just too high.
And I think that when we see the evidence from that report, I think that that`s going to be a green light for a lot of people to follow Lindsey Graham`s lead on all of this and say look, we`re not going to cover up for Julian Assange and the Russians.
MELBER: Right. And I think that`s a fair point. But it raises another problem, which is Donald trump trying to set a precedent where the premise is to disbelieve anything coming out from the government.
SYKES: Right.
MELBER: And then they have to prove it up.
SYKES: Exactly.
MELBER: That is never how we`ve done it. Skepticism, sure but never done it quite like that and certainly not by weighting some of the sources that Donald Trump has been trying to hold up as on par with our nation`s intelligence.
SYKES: Yes.
MELBER: EVAN McMullin and Charlie Sykes, thank you both.
MCMULLIN: Thank you.
SYKES: Thank you.
MELBER: Coming up, the very blue state of California, bright blue, readying to get in the front of the line for the resistance of the policies of a Trump administration. We`ll explain how.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
ANTHONY RENDON, SPEAKER OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSEMBLY: Californians may accept the lawfulness of the November election, but millions of us do not accept the sentiment delivered by this election. Californians should be wary of the national calls for unity and healing. Californians do not need healing. We need to fight.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
MELBER: That was Anthony Rendon. He is the California State Assembly speaker. That was about a month ago while he was pledging for a strong fight against the new Trump administration. It makes a lot of sense for California politically to lead any ensuing Trump resistance. Democrats hold every statewide political position there. They control 2/3 of the state senate and assembly. And by the way, Hillary Clinton won that state by more than 4.2 million votes.
The state`s progressive policies have also been pushing the nation forward on a range of issues from the environment to gay marriage and states in general can clash with administrations in pretty much two key ways. First, unlike normal citizens, states have an automatic power to sue a federal administration. That`s why about two dozen republican-led states have sued the Obama administration recently over Obamacare, although they did lose most of those cases. The second way is by passing state laws that could impact federal policy which then could leave a jump ball on the courts to decide who ultimately gets to call the shots, the state in question or the federal government.
And to prepare themselves for these promised fights, these California democrats say they need a lawyer. And we could tell you until today it wasn`t really clear how big a priority this planned effort was. You know, were they just giving the speeches like the one I showed you over a month ago or was a real plan kicking in? Well today California announced the council they`ve retained. It`s a name you might recognize. Former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder.
Joining me now to discuss all of this, a very prominent California politician Antonio Villaraigosa, former mayor of Los Angeles and currently a candidate for the governor of California in 2018, you seem like the right guy to talk to tonight. I appreciate you making time for us.
ANTONIO VILLARAIGOSA, FMR. MAYOR, LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA: Ari, always great to talk to you.
MELBER: Great to talk to you.
VILLARAIGOSA: I haven`t seen you since the convention.
MELBER: Yes. Let me start with the basics for folks who haven`t been following this closely around the country. What is California up to here?
VILLARAIGOSA: Well, first of all, nobody has more at stake than California. You said it. California is leading the nation in much of the world on climate change. And not just climate change, but clean tech jobs. It`s the clean tech epicenter of the nation. And there is no question that with respect to repealing Obamacare, no state will lose more. Maybe some say between 20 and $40 billion in federal dollars.
So, and there is no question that it`s the epicenter of foreign born and the immigrant community that no state will be impacted economically more than some than California with respect to some of the policies of the Trump administration.
MELBER: So let me - let me -
VILLARAIGOSA: That we have to be clear on. It`s not just that it`s a blue state, that`s it we have so much at stake.
MELBER: Sure. And on the immigration point, this is a big one. The president used his lawful authority to change some of the immigration enforcement priorities, right? But by the same token, the new president, Donald Trump, starting January 20th could roll some of that back, and that could also be pretty lawful. What do you think is the right role for the California State Government to play there? How much can they try to evade what might be a new executive order to focus more on rounding up people who are currently in this state who are undocumented?
VILLARAIGOSA: I think everybody knows that the federal government has authority over immigration and the state can`t replace the federal government. But they also have a responsibility for maintaining the public safety. And I think what California has said is that we`re going to focus on our primary responsibility of enforcing our criminal laws and let the federal government work on immigration. So with respect to that, our police officers and most of our cities in this state are going to focus on making sure that the community is cooperating with the police department, that they`re working and collaborating with them.
And not going to act as immigration agents. With respect to health care, I think we`re going to protect Medicaid. Because that`s probably the most vulnerable part of Obamacare in this state and with respect to climate change, I think what we need to do is to continue to generate clean tech jobs. As you probably know, California generated last year more jobs than Texas and Florida combined. So what we need to do is make sure that more people are participating in that economy. And the economy works for more people.
MELBER: Right.
VILLARAIGOSA: That we`re lift mortgage of them into the middle class, that we`re investing in a greater part of the state, not just the coast.
MELBER: Right.
VILLARAIGOSA: I think if we do those things that`s the best way to take on the Trump administration.
MELBER: Well, we`re out of time. But I`m going tell Florida and Texas what you said about their job growth. Former Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa.
VILLARAIGOSA: Well it`s true.
MELBER: Thanks for your time, appreciate it.
VILLARAIGOSA: Thank you, Ari.
MELBER: And coming up Bernie Sanders wants Donald Trump to Tweet.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (I), VERMONT: May 7th, 2015, Donald Trump tweeted ""I was the first and only potential GOP candidate to state there will be no cuts to Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid."". If he was sincere, then I would hope that tomorrow or maybe today he could send out a Tweet and tell his Republican colleagues to stop wasting their time and all of our time and for Mr. Trump to tell the American people that he will veto any proposal that cuts Medicare, that cuts Medicaid and that cuts Social Security.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
MELBER: A prominent Republican leveling a shocking attack on one of Congress`s most trusted and vital institutions. That`s next.
MELBER: We want to close the show tonight by talking about something very important. Since the election more American`s have learned about the problem of online fake news. The term doesn`t refer to just political spin or overheated opinions but rather to completely false made-up stories like these. FBI agent suspected in Hillary e-mail leaks found dead in apparent murder-suicide or Wikileaks confirms Hillary sold weapons to ISIS. There is nothing new about conspiracy theories or internet hoaxes.
But one report found that some of those false stories I just show you were the most read items on Facebook heading into the election reaching tens of millions. That`s the bad news about fake news. The good news right now is the new scrutiny is already leading to some reforms. Facebook announcing plans to curb fake news. Some hucksters feeling blowback for pushing fake news. But now there is blowback to the blowback as some are trying to flip the script and say that stories about real facts are themselves just fake news. This is very important. Here is an exchange today with a former Republican Senator Jim DeMint who now leads the influential Heritage Foundation.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
CAROL COSTELLO, CNN ANCHOR: This is according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office and the Federal Reserve in Dallas, preventative care provided by Obamacare, paid for Obamacare saves money and health care costs overall. In 2015, the cost of health care service increased 0.5. percent. The typical price increase before Obamacare, it was around 3 to 4 percent. Obamacare will lower the deficit by $143 billion over the next 10 years. So there are pluses to Obamacare. So how do you keep the pluses and get rid of the minuses?
JIM DEMINT (R), FMR. SOUTH CAROLINA SENATOR: Carol, you can put all that under the category of fake news. I can tell you we split almost -
COSTELLO: This is according to the Congressional Budget Office.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
MELBER: And Rush Limbaugh is now telling his large audience everything might be fake news. ""Nobody believes anything they hear anymore. Nobody trusts anything. The mainstream media has abandoned the very things that give it credibility. The fake news is the everyday news."" This is significant for two reasons. First Donald Trump has excelled with the rhetorical style of political movement built on challenging the basic facts that underpin debates.
Many of his arguments fare better when the public is confused. Trump may have never read the famous 1964 book about the paranoid style in American politics tracing the power of conspiracy theories and political paranoia among extremist movements but he has perfected it. Fake news fits right in both as a source of misinformation and as this new slur against the actual news. As media critic Jay Rosen explains in a new essay, there is an organized movement on the political right to discredit mainstream journalism. Its latest tactic to shout down as fake news any work of reporting that conflicts with its world view, leaving the term ""useless"" as a fraud alert. That`s number one.
The second reason this matters is because our debates about politics are increasingly debates about legitimacy, about what is true and who has the legitimate right to decide. That is why there`s been such an intense effort to dilute this label fake news because the label was helping beat back some of this nonsense. We have to keep calling out lies and misinformation. And we have to do it even more forcefully. Spreading the falsehood that an FBI agent was murder order a child sex ring was run out of a D.C. restaurant, two real canards here from this elect season.
That`s not just fake. The tooth fairy is fake. That is a lie. It is a fraud. And we are in a world that is now full of fraud news. And just as free speech doesn`t mean it`s OK to shout fire in a crowded theater. The free internet doesn`t make it OK to perpetuate fraudulent stories online that threaten real harm offline. Joining me now to discuss is Paul Farhi, media reporter at The Washington Post. What do you make of this attempt to hijack even the term fake news?
PAUL FARHI, MEDIA REPORTER, WASHINGTON POST: Yes, well I think you put it vitality well. The term has now been weaponized. It`s politicized. It`s a way to say that whatever you don`t like is not only untrue but is actively created to confuse you and to undermine the truth. So once you start down that road, facts have no meaning whatsoever. And, you know, to throw them all on the floor. We can`t figure out which is which. Calling it fake news you have to make some distinctions. You to separate out what is reportable, what is knowable and what is factual.
MELBER: Why is it so hard for some reporters to deal with a politician like Donald Trump who clearly traffics in falsehoods in a manner that has been documented to be far more frequent than the typical lies of politicians?
FARHI: I don`t think it`s hard to deal with him at all. We call him out over and over again. The question is you`re really asking is why is it hard for reader, viewers and voters to make the distinctions. Not that we are the owners of truth but we tend to go to the middle of the line, unlike politicians who, you know, speak only in their self-interest.
MELBER: On one of the canards I mentioned, we can put up the polling on the so-called Pizzagate Controversy, that there was a Hillary Clinton child sex ring, not true. Among Trump registered voters you see there, 46 percent say that was either definitely or probably true. Does that concern you when the outlines of that story itself were preposterous before you even look at the underlying fact checking?
FARHI: That absolutely terrifies me because if we can`t in a society at least agree on some facts, we got nothing to talk about. And you`re talking about chaos now.
MELBER: What do you think final question is the role of Facebook or these platforms that don`t do the investigative reporting that institutions like yours does, Washington Post but have now become major players?
FARHI: Well I mean they`re trying to take some steps to vet some of this stuff. But it`s very hard. It`s like, you know, getting rid of the weeds in your garden. You must stay constantly vigilant. I don`t know if they are the stamina and the energy to keep up with it. We`ll see.
MELBER: Right and the stamina, the energy and the dynamic of having a legitimate institutional framework. Social networks are very good at being social, which is great. But we can`t just leave it up to everyone to vote on what the facts are. Paul Farhi, thanks for joining me tonight. I really appreciate it.
FARHI: Thank you, Ari.
MELBER: I`m Ari Melber. And that is the Last Word tonight. As Lawrence noted earlier this week if you were watching you can always reach me at e- mail at ari@msnbc.com Lawrence even e-mails me there sometimes. Now MSNBC`s live coverage continues into ""THE 11TH HOUR"" next."
0	41	 42 von 72	MSNBC	January 4, 2017 Wednesday	 THE RACHEL MADDOW SHOW	 9:00 PM EST	"HIGHLIGHT: A burgeoning anti-Trump movement is taking shape with local, grassroots organizing, in some ways mirroring the tea party`s anti-Obama movement. Ezra Levin, co-author of the ""Indivisible"" guide, talked with Rachel Maddow about helping online, local, grassroots activists organize resistance to the Donald Trump agenda more effectively. Gerry Hebert, executive director of the Campaign Legal Center, talked with Rachel Maddow about how Donald Trump`s pick for Attorney General, Senator Jeff Sessions, falsified his history of legal work on civil rights.

"	"JOY REID, MSNBC GUEST HOST: THE RACHEL MADDOW SHOW starts right now.
And good evening, Rachel. I`m quite sure that Beyonce would perform two times at your inaugural!
(LAUGHTER)
RACHEL MADDOW, MSNBC HOST: Depending on what I was being inaugurated to, Joy.
REID: That is true.
MADDOW: Depending.
REID: To anything. Have a good show. 
MADDOW: Good to see you.
And thanks to you at home for being with us this hour.
There`s a lot going on. It`s going to be an exciting show.
Before Barack Obama had his first inauguration as president eight years ago, before him, the president who turned out the biggest crowd ever to witness his inauguration was LBJ in 1965. Not what you would imagine, right? But it`s true.
He held the record, more than a million people turned out to see Lyndon Baines Johnson inaugurated in January of 1965 that was interestingly his second inauguration, right? Of course, his first inauguration happened under very different very extreme circumstances. President Kennedy was assassinated and vice president Johnson had to become president Johnson, had to be sworn in as the new president on an airplane. That was his first inauguration.
1963, of course, under terrible circumstances. But then he won a huge election victory in his own right in 1964, and then a record crowd of Americans, the biggest crowd ever in D.C. for anything turned out to see him inaugurated for the second time. That record for the largest crowd ever for an inauguration stood for 44 years, until Barack Obama. Yeah. Remember that?
This was Washington, D.C., January 20th, 2009. Barack Obama being sworn in as president for the first time. It`s interesting. We don`t have a hard- and-fast crowd estimate for how many people were there but nobody disputes he beat the record, that he beat LBJ`s record.
And a big part of that undoubtedly was the historic nature of his election as the first African-American president. But, you know, another part of it was the momentum coming out of his victory in the 2008 election. I mean, he won election in 2008 by 10 million votes. The Electoral College was 365-173.
The Democrats added 21 seats to what was already their majority in the House. They went all the way up to a super majority in the Senate and, yeah, the 2008 election had been hard fought and they had called him every name in the book. But by the time Barack Obama stood there on the dais to have Chief Justice John Roberts screw up his oath of office, he had a 67 percent approval rating. That was January 20th, 2009. That then became the most attended event ever in the history of Washington, D.C.
And at the time, I mean, Democrats were on top of the world and the Republicans were the exact opposite. I mean, the Republicans controlled nothing in Washington at that time. They had just been shellacked. Their outgoing president was so unpopular, their candidate against Barack Obama wouldn`t even appear with them during the campaign.
Who is going to be the leader of the Republican Party after that? They just got shellacked, and the Democrats brought this incredible head of steam with them into January, 2009, in Washington with what was it, two million people turning out to see the new Democratic president sworn in, January, 20th, 2009.
But you know what? By February, 2009, by the very next month, the turn had started in the other direction. Less than a month after President Obama was sworn in in Washington, protests started against him. These are not campaign events from McCain versus Obama, these are protests against the new president, the new very popular president and against specifically the stimulus bill he got passed in order to try to stop the freefall of the economy at the start of the Great Depression.
Obama inaugurated January 20th. By February 16th, there were protests in Seattle. Then, the next day, they were in Colorado and then they were in Tampa and then they were in Nashville and then Atlanta. There were little pitiful protests in D.C.
But they were building. And at first, nobody called them the Tea Party, but they started in February. By April, by Tax Day 2009, they were calling them the Tea Party. And by the summer, members of Congress went home for the summer recess, did these town hall meetings and suddenly they found town hall meetings all over the country filled with anti-Obama protesters demanding to be heard, not leaving, holding their member of Congress`s feet to the fire.
This anti-Obama movement that started basically as soon as he was sworn in and had blown up by the summer. And, you know, yeah, the Democrats had good numbers in Washington. They had won the election by a lot, but the whole political discussion in the country by late spring early summer that year was about this resistance, this movement that sprung up apparently out of nowhere, that members of Congress were facing at home in their districts, in their faces every time they popped their heads up about absolutely anything.
And I`m not telling you anything you don`t know, right? This isn`t ancient history. We all remember this happened at the start of the Obama presidency.
But what I think is hard to remember about it is how quickly it started. It started so fast. It started basically as soon as he got to Washington. Even though he came in with so much Washington power because of the election results in 2008, Washington power only goes so far, even in electoral politics. That`s what happened the last time we got a new president of a new party.
And now, it remains to be seen if there will be an anti-Trump movement during this next presidency. But we`re starting to figure out what at least the first shoots of it might look like.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: All right, guys, we just came from visiting Congressman Goodlatte`s office. We had 12 people, we delivered new year`s cards. It was easy, it was fun and hopefully he will hear our demands that he represent us and our issues going forward here in Roanoke.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
MADDOW: You do not recognize these people because these are not famous people. This is three people from Roanoke, Virginia. Because they`re from Roanoke, that means their congressman is Republican Congressman Bob Goodlatte, and he is the Republican congressman who wrote that amendment this week to gut the independent ethics office. There`s been this big controversy this week as the first order of business for the new Republican-led Congress, Bob Goodlatte`s amendment would have stripped the office of this power.
And when these folks, these local constituents of Bob Goodlatte`s, when they heard about, when they heard what they had done, when they heard about this controversy, and that it was their congressman that was doing it, they did something that`s not very hard, they went down to his office. As they said, to wish him a happy new year.
They made him a card. We think we have a picture -- yes, this particular one I wanted to show you. See the card, it says there in handwriting ""Happy New Year."" But then it also says, ""We expect better."" And what you see there, I think, is him photo shopped into the swamp thing. Which is not threatening in any way but it`s also not subtle. Swamp thing.
And, you know, this is not a lot of people doing this. They did get a little pickup in the local press. Bob Goodlatte`s local staff at his office in Roanoke, they did have to deal with them for doing this office visit, but it`s not like one action like this is going to change the course of Congressman Goodlatte`s political trajectory.
But that one action doesn`t exist on its own. Doesn`t exist in a vacuum. What we`re covering tonight at the top of the show is that there is something bubbling out there. I know this is not a mainstream story yet, but I`m telling you, this is going on and it`s about to be a mainstream story sometime soon.
The reason that amendment killing the ethics office died, the reason it had to get rescinded and turned the whole first day of the Republican Congress into a circus and a farce, the reason that thing turned back on them and they had to stop doing what they were otherwise going to do is because of what Robert Costa at the ""Washington Post"" describes as ""a blizzard of angry con stitch when calls."" That`s what Republican members of Congress told him they got after this news broke about them trying to kill the ethics office.
After the news broke, look at this. Look at this. Google -- look at this -- Google says searches spiked online for the phrase ""who is my representative?"" Something`s going on. Something is bubbling out there.
""The Washington Post"" just profiled the retired lawyer in Hawaii, 60- something woman lives in Hawaii, never been particularly politically active in her life. She had never set up a Facebook event page before.
But she decided she wanted to do something. She asked a friend to help her set up a Facebook event page for a march on Washington after Donald Trump`s inauguration. Didn`t put too much thought into it, but decided she`d do what she could do. When she went to bed that night after she made the Facebook event page, there were 40 people who said they were interested. When she woke up the next morning, 10,000 people had RSVP`d and said they were going, overnight.
You probably heard about this march by now. Donald Trump`s inauguration will be January 20th. This march will be the day after, January 21st. It`s on, they`ve got a permit. They need to raise a million or two bucks in order to pay for the sound system and port-a-potties and all that stuff.
But right now, they have 166,000 people who say they are definitely coming. They`ve got a quarter million people who say they are interested. Over a thousand buses are already booked to take people to this event.
And you can tell from their organizing materials that however lackadaisically this might have started, even though this may have been a leap in somebody`s heart in terms of how they started it, you can tell from the organizing materials they`re getting this thing together.
Right now, if you go to their web site, you say you`re going to go, you get a little questionnaire, how are you getting to D.C.? Are you taking a bus? Are you taking a plane? Are you taking a train? Are you walking? When you get here, will you be using the metro system? They`re trying to figure out the logistics in case they get a few hundred thousand people.
And this is interesting. What level of communication do you want from the march organizers? As much as possible? The bare minimum about the most important event details? You know, just important event information, some updates? Then give us your e-mail, give us your mobile phone.
That`s what happens when you sign up and say you`re going to this march. It`s happening, it`s being organized, it`s getting increasingly organized. It`s on. That`s the day after the inauguration, that`s January 21st, the women`s march on Washington.
But there`s marching on Washington -- which happens a lot for a lot of different reasons -- there`s also marching at home. And this I think is particularly invisible and particularly interesting. What those women did at Bob Goodlatte`s office in Roanoke, Virginia, this morning, and what these folks did at Senator Corey Gardner`s office in Colorado yesterday with the sad dead plant in his lobby, this kind of small scale home state stuff where you act, where you live already, where you don`t travel to some other place to make a symbolic case, but you travel to your local elected official, you make a stand where you are, you work with the people who have to be accountable to you.
That kind of local action is what leading Democrats are now saying will help the most with what`s happening in Washington.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (I), VERMONT: On January 15, for the first time in the modern history of the Democratic Party, Democrats are going to bee organizing rallies all across this country in opposition to the Republican budget, which calls for throwing 30 million people off of health care, throwing their insurance away, privatizing Medicare, making massive cuts in Medicaid and at the same time giving huge tax breaks to the wealthy. So, what I think Chuck understands and what Democrats increasingly understand is you can`t just go to fund-raisers with wealthy people, you`ve got to get out in the real world.
MADDOW: This January 15th plan, this will be the weekend before the inauguration, you`re not expecting people to convene in one place? Not telling everybody to come to Washington. You`re telling people to rally in their home districts, in their home states.
SANDERS: Right. What we`re asking is U.S. senators, members of the House, labor unions, environmental groups, senior groups, ordinary people to come together and tell the Republican Party that their priorities are absolutely backwards.
MADDOW: In addition to that role that you`ve gotten, Senate leadership and the kind of demonstrations you`re calling for there, it`s interesting for calling for members of Congress themselves and senators themselves --
SANDERS: Yeah, ain`t it?
(END VIDEO CLIP)
MADDOW: The Democratic Party with Senator Bernie Sanders as their new director of outreach in Senate leadership, they are calling for people to rally over Martin Luther King weekend. The Sunday before the inauguration, January 15th.
It`s interesting to know. We`ve got this big march on Washington plan which had apparently is going to be hundreds of thousands of people if people show up like they say they`re going to, that`s going to be the day after the inauguration but the weekend before that, not in Washington but at home, where you live, wherever you live, that`s where the Democratic leadership is calling for people to get together to start showing their faces.
And it`s interesting, right? Bernie Sanders, in terms of his organizing background, the way Bernie Sanders is trying to change the Democratic Party right now, is by getting Democratic actual elected leaders, members of Congress, members of the Senate. He`s trying to get them to actually go help organize in their home states, in their home districts, and lead events like this all over the country. That, of course, would be a new role, a new goal for the Democratic Party and what their elected officials do. That would be a new thing, that would be a new way of organizing if the Democrats can actually do it.
But whether or not they can do it, whether or not the Democratic elected officials of this country decide that`s what they`re going to do, try to get people out there showing their faces and making themselves known, whether or not the party pulls it off, regular people are starting to do it on their own. We saw in that avalanche of calls to Congress yesterday. That really did force the Republicans to drop that ethics thing that they were otherwise going to do.
But we`re also seeing some signs about something that is going to build on itself in the way this goes forward in the next really few days, couple of weeks.
Watch this. I showed you that selfie video those women shot in Roanoke this morning? Watch the end of this.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: And we had about how many news organizations covering this event?
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Three. We had cameras from TV, we had newspapers, our media release went out an hour before our event. There is a lot of interest in covering this kind of groundswell organizing.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: So great job today. Effective?
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yeah. Read ""Indivisible"". It really works.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
MADDOW: Read ""Indivisible"". What is ""Indivisible""? This is ""Indivisible."" It`s kind of the secret sauce that explains what is bubbling up as what may be the start of the anti-Trump movement. It`s called ""Indivisible.""
And you should know this is out there because if there is going to be an anti-Trump movement in this country, particularly one akin to the kind of anti-Obama movement that afflicted the last presidency at the outset of their time in Washington, if there is going to be an anti-Trump movement, I think right now, this is going to explain a lot about what its early stages look like over the next couple weeks.
This started as an online Google document last month. It has now evolved into this slim little 25-page organizing guide. It`s not a complicated thing. It was written, interestingly, by former congressional staffers basically advising people all around the country who are anti-Trump for whatever reason that they should learn from the tactical success of the Tea Party as they went up against Barack Obama.
I`m going to quote from the guide here, ""The authors of this guide are former congressional staffers who witnessed the rise of the Tea Party. We saw these activists take on a popular president with a mandate for clang and a supermajority in Congress. We saw them organize locally and convince their own members of Congress to reject President Obama`s agenda. Their ideas were wrong, cruel, and tinged with racism and they won.""
So, the reason I`m talking about this tonight and the reason we`re going to talk about one of the authors of this guide in just a moment is because this has not been cooking openly, right, in the Beltway media and cable TV news and places we usually look for news about politics. It has really been looking online where it has taken off.
It has already led to hundreds of local groups being registered online around this idea and springing up all over the country. I think that`s in part because this is very practical. It makes the whole idea very easy.
For example, this is a sample call script for what you should say how you should expect it to go when you call your member of Congress to complain about something. There`s very, very practical information.
Should I bring a sign to my member of congress`s town hall event? Should I bring a sign? Answer, a blunt answer. Signs can be useful for reinforcing the sense of broad agreement with your message. However, if you are holding an oppositional sign, staffers will almost certainly not give you the chance to get the mike and ask a question. Right.
And then this, if you have enough people to both ask questions and hold signs, though, you should go for it.
Or this, a practical question. Help, my members of Congress are actually pretty good. The answer to that is, in part, congratulations. But also this, ""do not switch to targeting other members of Congress who don`t represent you. They don`t represent you and they don`t care what you have to say.""
Did I mention this was written by former congressional staffers who know of what they speak? Who know how members of Congress react to all sorts of various stimuli?
We`re going to know a lot over the next couple weeks about whether or not there will be a big anti-Trump movement in this country. It started almost immediately against Barack Obama in 2009. It started way sooner than you remember, started within a couple weeks of him being inaugurated.
Part of the reason why if the anti-Trump movement does emerge, part of the reason why will be the Democratic Party`s determination to try to stop what Trump says he wants to do in Washington. And you see that in different ways around the country. You see that, for example, in the Democrat- dominated state of California with them hiring former Attorney General Eric Holder today to advise them on their legal strategy as a state against the Trump administration today. That will be part of the anti-Trump movement.
You`ll see it in the Washington like with what Chuck Schumer told us last night on the show about the Democrats in the Senate and their determination to hold that Supreme Court seat open if they have to and if they have and to slow down the confirmation process for the cabinet appointments if they have to and if they can.
So, you see these things in government and you`ll see these things with elected officials and legislatures and legislators in Washington but the more invisible and bigger force already out there, which really already does look like the start of an anti-Trump movement is regular people already starting this organizing themselves. More ahead.

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: And we had about how many news organizations covering this event?
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Three. We had cameras from TV, we had newspapers, our media release went out an hour before our event. There is a lot of interest in covering this kind of groundswell organizing.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: So great job today. Effective?
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yeah. Read ""Indivisible"". It really works.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
MADDOW: Read ""Indivisible"", it really works. ""Indivisible"", this document that its creators hope will be a how-to guide for resisting the Trump agenda. It`s basically the thing you need to know about in politics right now if you are looking for signs of whether there will be a significant anti-Trump movement in this country.
Part of that we will see in terms of the big Washington mobilization that is expected the day after the Trump inauguration, but part of it will happen in a disambiguated way all around the country. We`re seeing the first signs of that now. We`re definitely seeing the organizing to try to make that happen as we speak.
Joining us now is Ezra Levin. He`s a former policy adviser to Congressman Lloyd Doggett. He`s one of the authors of ""Indivisible.""
Ezra, thanks for being here. Appreciate it.
EZRA LEVIN, ""INDIVISIBLE"" CO-AUTHOR: Thank you so much for having me. Glad to be here.
MADDOW: Did I get anything wrong in terms of explaining what you`re trying to do?
LEVIN: No, I don`t know what else to say now. It seems like you covered it all.
MADDOW: Well, good night. Nice to see you.
Why did you decide to do this and how many people were involved in creating this?
LEVIN: There were at least two or three dozen people involved. We decided to do it because we were going through the stages of grief, as many liberals were after the election, and we were also hearing these stories of people starting up new organizations to actually push against Trump. There are secret Facebook groups or their mailing lists and trying to figure out what can we do to make sure that Congress doesn`t enact Trump`s agenda. They knew about petitions and calling their members of Congress but they didn`t know what the next step was beyond that.
As a former congressional staffer, I have basically no skills but I do know how Congress works and I and a lot of other congressional staffers got together and said, look, we know what works, we saw the Tea Party rise up, we saw them implement really effective strategies and tactics to prevent an incredibly popular president`s agenda from being implemented. This can work for us, the progressive movement, today if it worked for the Tea Party eight years ago.
MADDOW: It seems to me in reading this, I feel like you`re trying to sort of gently dispel some popular myths about what must affect members of Congress. You`re basically saying, listen, form letters, don`t bother, online petitions, nice, but it`s not the thing that actually makes a difference to the member of Congress on the ground. Is that fair to say?
LEVIN: That`s absolutely right.
So, the Tea Party really understood a couple things about how their members of Congress thought. One, they understood that their members of Congress cared about them, their constituents, and not other people. And, two, they understood that they weren`t setting the agenda for the next eight years, the Democrats controlled the House, they controlled the Senate, they had the presidency, but the Tea Party could play defense. They could respond to everything coming down the pike and say no.
MADDOW: So that`s a crucial strategic point you make. You basically say, listen, as liberals we would love to focus on a positive agenda for how we would like to do things different, but as long as there`s zero power in Washington to do that, there`s no point in focusing on that now, let`s instead focus on saying no to what people in power are going to do. Exclusively.
LEVIN: Yes, I don`t think progressives should give up the idea of a bold progressive future. I think that`s important. But if you`re an advocate on the ground and you`re talking to Representative Goodlatte or anybody else, what you`re going to be doing is be responding to what Congress is doing today. Yesterday, it was trying to make Congress even more corrupt than Congress already is. Tomorrow, it`s going to be something bad, too.
So, you have the power to just say this is unacceptable and we`ve seen that happening all over the country now. You`re talking about a bubbling up movement. We`re seeing it. Yesterday was the first proof of concept and I think we`re going to see a lot more of that.
MADDOW: Have you seen in terms of the direct response to this, enough posted online so you know how many people have downloaded it. You know how many people have read it. But are you seeing in terms of groups forming or other people using this work?
LEVIN: It`s phenomenal. I`ve got to say. We`ve been blown away. We put up a Google doc two and a half weeks ago, Google immediately crashed.
We threw up a web site so people had a way to download it and get the information. In the last two weeks that we`ve had this up, there have been over 600,000 page views, there had been 130,000 people have downloaded the guide. But like you said the really exciting thing is that there are all these groups spreading out all across the country and popping up.
We`ve had in the last 24 hours since we`ve been collecting groups that are trying to resist Trump, 350 folks register. My phone --
MADDOW: Three hundred fifty groups?
LEVIN: Groups, 350 groups all over the country. My phone buzzes every time a new one goes in and it`s been vibrating since we`ve been talking. Every few minutes, more people are coming online.
And what they look like is what the ""Indivisible"" Roanoke group looks like. They`re in Milwaukee. They`re in Florida. They`re in New York. They`re in California. They`re in Pennsylvania.
We`ve covered just about every single state and we have subscribers in literally every single congressional district in the country.
MADDOW: Pretty good for a Google document you whipped up with a few friends. Yes.
LEVIN: It`s not what we did. The movement already existed. We`re just speaking to it a little bit.
MADDOW: Ezra Levin, former policy adviser to Congressman Lloyd Doggett and a man involved in a phenomenon I`m not sure the beltway has caught on to yet, but I think they`re about to hear from soon. Good luck. Thanks.
LEVIN: Thank you so much.
MADDOW: All right. Lots to come, lots going on in the news tonight. Stay with us.
MADDOW: Confirmation hearings start next week for the people who have been tapped for the new administration`s cabinet offices. They`re going to be really stacked up.
In the middle of it all, President Obama is going to be giving his farewell address. Donald Trump is going to be giving his first press conference since the summer. We`re going to have the secretary of state, the attorney general, the secretary of education, all these very controversial nominees coming up all at once. We are about to start seeing the parade of people who have been tapped by the president-elect to run the federal government.
There is a huge mystery, though, about one person who was very, very, very close to the president-elect, who was expected to get a very, very big job, who so far has not just been blanked, has been worse than blanked. Why is that? And when are we going to get the answer to that mystery? That`s next.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENT-ELECT: They never said, ""Hey, boss, we`re closing up the George Washington Bridge tonight."" No, they never said. They`re talking about the weather, right?
(LAUGHTER)
Then, so that -- he knew about it, he knew about it. Totally knew about it.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
MADDOW: You know who`s having a hard time right now?
Chris Christie is having a hard time right now. Right before the holiday break, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie tried to get the state legislature to pass a new law that would allow him to personally profit from a book deal while he is still in office. Amid public outcry, they said no.
He also tried to get them to pass a bill that was apparently designed to bankrupt newspapers all over the state of New Jersey. Again, amid more public outcry, they said no.
When there is a public outcry about any politics in New Jersey these days, it`s generally against that state`s wildly disliked governor. It was a particularly bad batch for him last month when he got not just his usual terrible local press, he got a nice big round of terrible national press, that was because his approval ratings went so low he not only became the most-disliked governor in the country, he became the most-disliked governor in any state in 20 years, in any state. In 20 years.
And just think about the year he`s had. I mean, this is where his road to the White House was going to start. Remember, he basically skipped Iowa, went straight to New Hampshire. Moved to New Hampshire, bet his whole presidential campaign on New Hampshire and he got absolutely creamed in New Hampshire. Didn`t even hit double digits, came in sixth.
Since then, it`s been disaster on disaster. After he came out and decided he would support Donald Trump instead, during the election campaign, during the general election, the Trump campaign decided to put Chris Christie in charge of the transition that was until, oh, my God, it looks like there`s going to be a transition, at which point they quickly, quickly fired Chris Christie from the transition.
They fired him. They fired his best political friend from home who was working with him on the transition. They fired his chief of staff who he had also had working with him on the transition.
And if that wasn`t humiliating enough, then came the true humiliation, reports that Chris Christie asked the president-elect for the post of attorney general. The answer was no. That`s going to be Jeff Sessions.
Reports that Chris Christie asked to be chair of the Republican Party. No, that`s going to be Mitt Romney`s niece?
Reports that Chris Christie recommended Mike Rogers to be national security advisor. The answer to that one is no as well.
Reports that Chris Christie recommended a lawyer friend of his who was linked to the Bridgegate inquiry, recommended her for SEC chair. The answer to that one also no, it`s going to be some lawyer guy who was a lawyer for Goldman Sachs, naturally.
It`s just been no, no, no, no, no. He have has been kicked so hard by Trump since the election, it`s kind of hard to see what bones might be left for Trump to break. But today, they found another one.
Part of the received wisdom of why Chris Christie couldn`t win the presidency in his own right, why he couldn`t be on the Trump ticket as a running mate, why the Trump folks have been shedding him like water off a duck ever since Trump won, the common received wisdom is because -- Bridgegate has a stink, right? Four of his top aides and appointees convicted or pleading guilty. The scheme to snarl traffic on purpose for days in order to enact petty political revenge against some small-town mayor. That`s been the supposition, right?
This bridge thing stinks. It was such an ugly, petty, Nixonian criminal vicious dirty political trick, that you can`t somewhere have somebody associated with that around, you can`t have Christie around because the stink is still on him. That`s been the wisdom of maybe what happened here.
No. Apparently, the stink of Bridgegate is not a problem at all because today the new White House political director was just announced. This is like the Karl Rove job in the Trump White House and the political director in the Trump White House is going to be Chris Christie`s former campaign manager, who was all caught up in Bridgegate.
According to witnesses, he knew about it while it was happening, he was described as having been in on it, he was one of the only people in Christie`s whole circle who Chris Christie actually threw under the bus and publicly shamed and fired for Bridgegate. That guy got a job, but Chris Christie apparently doesn`t.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
GOV. CHRIS CHRISTIE (R), NEW JERSEY: I was disturbed by the tone and behavior and attitude, callous indifference that was displayed in the e- mails by my former campaign manager, Bill Stepien. And reading that, it made me lose my confidence in Bill`s judgment. And you cannot have someone at the top of your political operation who you do not have confidence in.
As a result, I`ve instructed Bill Stepien to not place his name in nomination for state party chairman and he will not be considered for state party chairman and I`ve instructed him to withdraw his consultancy with the Republican governors` association. If I can not trust someone`s judgment, I cannot ask others to do so and I would not place him at the head of my political operation because of the lack of judgment that was shown in the e-mails that were revealed yesterday.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
MADDOW: The main thing here is that Bill Stepien is going to be White House political director. We are all now about to experience what it means to have someone at the heart of a nationally notorious act of criminal political revenge acting from here on out as the political director at the White House, right? That`s something.
And it tells you something about the new administration and how they intend to operate that that`s who they are putting in charge of their political operation in the White House.
But also, just at a human level, at a Shakespearean drama level, this is a little bit astonishing, right? I mean, at a human level, this tells you just how many shovels of dirt they are willing to shovel on to Chris Christie.
No to him, a thousand times no. No to everyone he promised a job to, no to everyone he recommends, no to anyone associated with him except the guy he tried to publicly shame for the bridge scandal. Yeah, we`ll take him.
My only question now is after you treat a guy this badly, after you humiliate him this much, what`s his revenge going to be? Because you know he`s got something in mind.
MADDOW: Yesterday, this is what the visible resistance looked like to the pick of Jefferson Beauregard Sessions III to be the next attorney general of the United States. But if you thought the organized protest against his nomination was going to be like this, was going to be activists by the handful staging a sit-in at one of his offices, your count of that opposition would be off by roughly a gazillion jillion.
The Jeff Sessions nomination today, it all started coming together. This appears to be the cabinet nomination that`s going to reap the whirlwind and that kind of remarkable story is next.
Stay with us.
MADDOW: Even though senators are always supposed to be super nice to other senators, it`s starting to look like the most contentious confirmation hearing of the whole new administration might be for a sitting senator, for Jefferson Beauregard Sessions III, the Trump nominee to be attorney general.
Yesterday, activists, including the sitting national president of the NAACP, they sat in at Jeff Session`s district office in Mobile, Alabama, and got arrested in protest of his nomination to be attorney general, given his dismal civil rights record. Also, over 1,300 law professors, including some of the biggest names in academic law in this country have come out publicly against his confirmation, that`s a lot and they are big names.
The judiciary committee yesterday received an eloquent and scathing letter from the immediate past governor of Massachusetts, Deval Patrick. He was part of the defense team when Jeff Sessions prosecuted three black civil rights activists in the most infamous prosecution from his time as U.S. attorney in Alabama back in the 1980s. Deval Patrick is now describing that experience and pleading with the judiciary committee that Sessions should not be attorney general.
The Sessions confirmation is officially red hot. It`s scheduled for Tuesday, but Dianne Feinstein, ranking Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, she has asked for a delay. You know, it`s not like the Trump folks didn`t know he`d be a controversial pick. They gave talking points on sessions to Senate Republicans.
In those talking points, they told Republicans that they should praise -- look at this -- Senator Session`s strong civil rights record, including a host of -- underlined -- desegregation lawsuit he filed in Alabama while he was U.S. attorney. Sessions himself has highlighted several civil rights cases he claimed to have litigated personally in Alabama.
But now, on top of everything else lining up against this nomination, now, this seems like kind of a killer blow. The former federal civil rights lawyers who actually did work on those desegregation cases, who actually did work on those civil rights cases in the 1980s that Jeff Sessions is claiming as part of his great civil rights record, those lawyers who did work on those cases have come forward publicly to say actually Jeff Sessions did nothing on these case which is he is claiming as his great civil rights legacy.
Quote, ""We worked in the Justice Department civil rights division which brought those lawsuits. We can state categorically that Jeff Sessions had no substantive involvement in any of them. Sessions has not worked to protect civil rights. He worked against civil rights at every turn. Jeff Sessions knows his real record on race and civil rights is harmful to his chances for confirmation so he has made up a fake one.
But many of us who were there in Alabama in the `80s and `90s and beyond, we`re still around. We lived that story, too, and we are here to testify that Jeff Sessions has done many things throughout his 40-year career. Protecting civil rights has not been one of them.""
All these things happening at once. The sit-in, including the president of the national NAACP, the 1,300 law professors, including lots of household names, the Deval Patrick letter telling the scathing story, Dianne Feinstein trying to delay the hearings.
Other civil rights and judiciary groups saying that his submissions to the committee, his questionnaire that he`s supposed to give the judiciary committee is shockingly incomplete. I mean, all of these forms of objection to him, they`re all interesting stories in and of themselves.
What ends up being the most interesting story of all is that they are all happening at once. And this is quite a barrier that he is now running into.
Joining us now is one of the former Justice Department lawyers who`s written this piece now, this op-ed in ""The Washington Post"" basically debunking Jeff Session`s civil rights claims about his own record.
His name is Jerry Hebert. Mr. Hebert is director of the voting rights and redistricting program at the Campaign Legal Center.
Mr. Hebert, thank you very much for your time tonight. Appreciate you being here.
GERRY HEBERT, CAMPAIGN LEGAL CENTER EXEC. DIRECTOR: Thank you for having me, Rachel. It`s a delight to be on your show, which I consider to be more important than ever now.
MADDOW: Oh, that`s very kind of you to say.
Let me ask you about this remarkable op-ed in ""The Washington Post"" which in a lot of ways speaks for itself. I sort of quoted the nut of your argument there.
But are you basically claiming that Jeff Sessions is claiming substantive work on civil rights cases that not only he did no substantive work on, but that he was basically opposed to the point of those cases?
HEBERT: Well, he certainly claims that he was involved in prosecuting those cases. He claimed them as his own. The purpose of us writing those words in that op-ed piece were to demonstrate that he is not going to be allowed to stand up and try to take credit for cases that we worked on, and that he really played no significant role in.
I was in Selma, Alabama for a number of years litigating voting rights cases. And he claims that he -- two of the cases that I handled were cases that he takes credit for.
I never saw him in Selma, Alabama, in the federal courtroom. He never appeared with me and really had no substantive involvement in any of those cases. Same thing --
MADDOW: Now, when you say substantive involvement, clearly, as the U.S. attorney here, he would have been signing filings. He would have been putting his name and literally his signature on some of the documents associated with those cases, wouldn`t he?
HEBERT: Actually, no. The way it works, Rachel, is that when the Justice Department files a civil rights case in Alabama, the case is litigated and we, up in Washington put the name of the U.S. attorney on all filings. Oftentimes, the U.S. attorney doesn`t even see the filings. And sometimes isn`t even notified if they aren`t a major filing in the case.
Typically, I would reference my filings with his assistant U.S. attorney, an African-American AUSA named Tom Figures (ph). But Jeff never reviewed any of the briefs and/or was asked to make any substantive comments on any filings. His name as a matter of formal process is simply put on the brief because he is the U.S. attorney for that district.
MADDOW: Do you think the Judiciary Committee and the confirmation process, as you understand it, is capable of teasing out these sort of subtleties? Obviously, the Trump transition believes that his name as U.S. attorney being associated with the filings that you did on those civil rights cases is enough to give him credit for those things. Do you think that the confirmation process is subtle enough and thorough enough that these things will be teased out and that he won`t be given credit for these things that he is claiming credit for?
HEBERT: Well, in 1986 when he was nominated to be a federal judge, the Senate Judiciary Committee, which was then controlled by Republicans also did give the opportunity for issues to be teased out. And when they were teased out, they found out that he had been racially insensitive in a number of comments that he had made, and his civil rights record was really questionable. And some Republicans on the committee made it clear that they just couldn`t support him.
Now, you make a good point that in the Senate, you know, there is a lot of camaraderie among the senators and it`s very difficult. In fact, when I testified in 1986, Senator Biden said he would find it very hard to vote against one of his colleagues if they were up for a federal judgeship. Well, I understand that, but I think they have a responsibility to really listen to all the facts and the evidence.
MADDOW: Gerry Hebert, executive director of the Campaign Legal Center in Washington -- thanks for helping us understand this tonight. Super interesting in the way you put this forward. Thanks. Appreciate you being here.
HEBERT: Thank you, Rachel.
MADDOW: All right. We`ll be right back. Stay with us.
MADDOW: One of the things about this new era that`s dawning in Washington is I`m hoping we get access to a lot more high profile, high power people in the Congress and the new administration than we have been getting in recent years. I`m ever hopeful. We got a good start on it last night with the top Democrat in the Senate, Chuck Schumer, being here. And boy did that cause a lot of reverberations today, including one very, very surprising one, and that`s next.
Stay with us.
MADDOW: A couple of very striking responses with our interview last night with the new Democratic leader in the Senate, Chuck Schumer. First off, it was nice to learn this morning that we apparently have an enthusiastic viewer of this show in the great state of Kentucky.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY), SENATE MAJORITY LEADER: I noticed my counterpart Senator Schumer announced yesterday that their goal was to apparently never fill the Supreme Court vacancy. I think that`s something the American people simply will not tolerate, and we`ll be looking forward to receiving a Supreme Court nomination and moving forward on it.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
MADDOW: I didn`t know you were watching, sir. But welcome, Senator McConnell. Please come be a guest on this show. I think we would have a lot to talk about.
And honestly, when people who are pulling the levers of government come talk to us, they frequently say stuff that really matters and makes news. Last night, we got the news from Senator Schumer, about the Supreme Court, whether they would hold open a seat. Today, we got the Republican response to that.
But that was the first bit of news from that interview. Another bit of it was about this.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
MADDOW: That actually, this intelligence briefing for the president-elect was always planned for Friday, it hasn`t been delayed. But he is taking these shots, this antagonism, this taunting. Do you think he has an agenda to try to dismantle parts of the intelligence community? I mean, this form of hostility --
SCHUMER: Let me tell you, whether you`re a super liberal Democrat or a very conservative Republican, you should be against dismantling the intelligence community.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
MADDOW: That was our hypothetical discussion last night. Do you think that`s what he is trying to do?
Tonight, ""Wall Street Journal"", ""Donald Trump plans revamp of top U.S. spy agency. Will restructure and pare back the nation`s top spy agency. People familiar with Trump`s planning say advisers are working on a plan to restructure the CIA, cutting back on staffing.""
We were talking about a hypothetical. Do you think what he was trying to do? That was last night. As of today, that`s exactly what he is doing.
That does it for us tonight. We will see you again tomorrow.
Now, it`s time for ""THE LAST WORD WITH LAWRENCE O`DONNELL"".
Good evening, Lawrence.

"	"CHRIS MATTHEWS, MSNBC HOST: Thanks for being with us. ""ALL IN"" starts right now.
JOY REID, MSNBC HOST: Tonight on ALL IN.

SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY), MINORITY LEADER: We`re united in our opposition to these republican attempts to make America sick again.
REID: Democrats unite to fight for Obamacare as the President-elect warns republicans over the risks of repeal.
MIKE PENCE, VICE PRESIDENT-ELECT OF THE UNITED STATES: And as he said this morning in a tweet. 
REID: Tonight, the fight to save Obamacare has officially begun and democrats have a plan.
Plus, the headquarters of the resistance, California, hires a high-powered attorney.

DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT-ELECT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: Wikileaks, I love Wikileaks.
REID: And from Rockettes to marching bands to brand-name celebrities, Donald Trump`s trouble attracting the star power he craves for his big day.
CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: You are not summoned to perform for the king or for the dictator.
REID: ALL IN starts now.""
Good evening from New York, I`m Joy Reid in for Chris Hayes. With just 16 days until Donald Trump becomes president, democrats say they have a battle plan for what will be the first big fight of the Trump administration. Obamacare, along with a fancy new slogan that they plan to use to make their case.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
SCHUMER: The republican plan to cut healthcare wouldn`t make America great again, it would make America sick again.
REID: That was incoming democratic leader Senator Charles Schumer this morning after Schumer and his democratic colleagues met on Capitol Hill today with President Obama to discuss their strategy to fight GOP efforts to repeal the health care law. Also on the Hill today was Vice President- elect Mike Pence who vowed the GOP`s repeal and replace plans are on track.
PENCE: As I said today to members of the senate, that the first order of business is to repeal and replace Obamacare.
REID: Senate republicans have now taken the first step in that direction, voting today to start debate on a budget resolution to repeal substantial parts of the law. But repeal is the easy part, it`s the replacement that`s the problem.
SCHUMER: For years they`ve talked about repeal but for five years now they have had nothing to put in its place. Now, they`re responsible for the entire health care system and it will be on their backs and I believe a year from now, they will regret that they came out so fast out of the box to repeal.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
REID: Now, democrats can`t stop republicans from hobbling Obamacare, but they can help make the process politically painful and potentially disastrous for the GOP, and they have a strategy. As POLITICO reports, democrats plan to hold rallies in Ohio, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia, featuring Americans who have benefited from the law. Leading up to nationwide rallies on January 15th warning of the chaos they say would ensue if the law is repealed. Democrats also plan to use the amendment process to force republican to take politically toxic votes on popular provisions like protecting people with pre-existing conditions. And they`re encouraging Americans to bombard their representatives with phone calls opposing repeal. Republicans have signaled, they plan to repeal the health care law in the near term, but maybe delay the effective date possibly for years as they work on a replacement.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
REP. PAUL RYAN (R-WI), SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE: We have a plan to replace it. We have plenty of ideas to replace it, and you`ll see as the weeks and months unfold, what we`re talking about replacing it.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
REID: But voting for repeal while delaying a replacement could mean massive financial losses for hospitals and insurers and potentially result in millions of Americans losing their healthcare coverage. The American medical association yesterday came out against the delayed replacement plan and some prominent republicans, including Senator Rand Paul, are warning about problems if they delay on a replacement. But republicans don`t have much in the way of good options. Replacing the law effectively means overhauling the entire American health care system. And let`s just say that`s not an easy task. Just ask democrats, especially if you want to keep the parts of Obamacare that Americans like.

LESLEY STAHL, AMERICAN TELEVISION JOURNALIST: When you replace it, are you going to make sure that people with pre-conditions are still covered?
TRUMP: Yes, because it happens to be one of the strongest assets.
STAHL: You`re going to keep that.
TRUMP: Also, with the children living with their parents for an extended period we`re going to --.
STAHL: You`re going to keep that?
TRUMP: -- very much try and keep that in. Adds cost but it`s very much something we`re going to try and keep.
REID: Well, Donald, you can`t keep all the good stuff like coverage for people with pre-existing conditions while eliminating the ostensibly bad stuff like the individual mandate that make that coverage possible. Trump himself seems to realize the political peril his party now faces and today, he seemed to walk pretty close to opposing repeal, Trump tweeting that, ""Republicans must be careful in that the Dems own the failed ObamaCare disaster"" and later adding ""it will fall of its own weight, be careful"". Now even if that were true and it most likely is not true, it would be political suicide for republicans to simply let the law stand after spending years and years casting it as a democracy-threatening disaster.
But the costs of repeal could be very, very high, particularly in the Rustbelt States that narrowly gave Trump his win. Take a look at these maps. The one on the left shows the percentage of Americans with health care coverage in 2013. See how it`s all dark there? And look at the one on the right. It shows the percentage of Americans with coverage in 2016. See, see all that light blue there on 2016 map? That`s where people got coverage and as you can see it was disproportionately right in those rust belt states. Well, now millions of people in those states face the possibility of losing their health care coverage and the party that is poised to take it away, that coverage, doesn`t seem to have any real plan in place to replace it. This morning on MSNBC, West Virginia Senator Joe Manchin, arguably the most conservative democrat in the senate, laid out the stakes.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
SEN. JOE MANCHIN (D), WEST VIRGINIA: Donald Trump won West Virginia by 43 percent. 43 percent. Unbelievable, OK? Now, a lot of the people didn`t know and they really still don`t know how they got health care called Affordable Care Act or Obamacare, but I`ll assure you one thing, they`ll know when -- who did it and got rid of it.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Exactly.
MANCHIN: They`ll know that. They might not know how they got it, they`ll know how they got rid of it.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
REID: Joining me now is Democratic Representative Karen Bass of California. All right, congresswoman. So the last thing that you just heard from Joe Manchin who`s arguably -- I mean, he is quite a red state conservative. As democrat his -- Trump won his state by 43 percent but you heard him say ""a lot of people don`t know, they really still don`t know how they got health care called ObamaCare but they`re sure going to know who got rid of it for them."" What is the democrats` plan to let those people know if republicans get rid of their health care, who done it?
REP. KAREN BASS (D), CALIFORNIA: Well, you know, I think first of all a lot of people think that Obamacare just covered people that didn`t have insurance. There`s a whole lot of parts to the plan that cover everybody, such as pre-existing conditions. Our health care caps. You know, I used to work in the emergency room in Los Angeles and the people that come to the emergency room or who came during those years were people who, one, had caps. In other words, I was on chemotherapy for two months, my insurance company said I hit my limit, they won`t cover my chemo anymore. Or somebody who had diabetes or hypertension and they couldn`t get health insurance so they come to the emergency room as a last resort. So if they get rid of Obamacare, those people will be back flooding emergency rooms and that`s one thing that has happened since ACA has been in place.
You`ve seen a decline of people who use the emergency room. Another thing is for prevention care. So you go and you have your colonoscopy. Well, you didn`t realize that with Obamacare, you now no longer pay for that colonoscopy. So if they get rid of Obamacare, you are going to have people complaining all over the place that, one, they didn`t have -- they don`t have coverage anymore, they`ve been cut off, they`ve been kicked off, and, two, the costs are going up because they`re -- they are paying for things they didn`t cover when they had Obamacare. People will realize the difference.
REID: Yeah, imagine people going into their doctors` offices and suddenly finding out they have a co-pay they didn`t have. Are democrats then going to make the connection? Because congresswoman, I got to tell you. One of the biggest criticisms of the party, even at the president, has been that when Obamacare was rolled out, democrats kind of walked away from it, some ran away from it, but never really explained to people what Obamacare is. A lot of people have what they had connect and in Kentucky and didn`t know that it was Obamacare.
BASS: I agree.
REID: Are the democrats going to do something concrete, meaning to run ads, meaning have specific stories showing, so that people know no, no, no, when you`re getting that co-pay, that was Obamacare?
BASS: Exactly, that`s absolutely right. And I agree with you. The other thing that I don`t think that we pointed out is that Obamacare has been a jobs plan. So when you talk about cutting off Obamacare, you are talking about serious layoffs in -- that are going to happen in hospitals because rural hospitals have had to depend on it. And a lot of these hospitals are in republican states. And so, I think the pain is going to be very wide and very deep and it is going to be our responsibility to make it very, very specific. I can tell you that my phones in the capital and in my district office were flooded today with people calling up and saying, well, is my insurance going to be cut off now? Am I going to have to pay for this? Well you know, I`ve had cancer, you know the only way I`ve been able to get health care is because of Obamacare so when the faucet is shut off, I believe the pain is going to be deep, it`s going to be wide and it is our responsibility to make sure that everybody understands who is responsible.
REID: Yeah, it`s pretty pointed that the three states you guys are starting off are in Pennsylvania, Ohio, and one West Virginia. Think about those coal miners` benefits for their black lung. That`s Obamacare.
BASS: Right.
REID: All right, I want to ask you a quick question on your way out. Mitch McConnell had a pretty interesting-- we`ll take a quick U-turn for a moment. Mitch McConnell had a little pretty interesting quote today that I want to play for you, and it`s about another thing that republicans have been holding up, and that`s the Supreme Court seat, which they held open for a very long time because they didn`t think Barack Obama as president had the right to make a nomination. Take a look at Mitch McConnell talking about democrats pretention holding up a Supreme Court nominee of Donald Trump`s.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
SEN. MITCH MCCONELL (R-KY), MAJORITY LEAER: Apparently, you had a new standard now, which is do not confirm a Supreme Court nominee at all. I think that`s something the American people simply will not tolerate.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
BASS: I mean, I can`t believe that he actually even said that when he was the one that said that they were not going to even have hearings, confirmation hearings. Well you know what, I`m very proud of the senate. I hope they hold that line. The idea that Trump, I mean, if his cabinet is any example as to who he would put forward would be on the Supreme Court, it would be disastrous. And I can see that protections that we`ve had in our country for decades being rolled back, so I think it`s a great stand. We need to emulate what the republicans did in 2016.
REID: Yeah, I -- that had nothing do with Obamacare, I just want to give you a chance to hear him say that and get your response. Congresswoman Karen Bass, thank you for your time tonight. I appreciate it.
BASS: Thanks for having me on.
REID: All right, joining me now, Democratic Strategist Jess McIntosh and Anton Gunn, who is a healthcare strategist extraordinaire. I`m going to come to you first on this, Jess, because here`s the thing. Republicans have been saying for so long that they`re going to repeal, repeal or replace, repeal and replace. It`s -- a catch phrase but they never had a risk of ever having to do it because they always had Barack Obama to save them from themselves.
JESS MCINTOSH, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST: Right.
REID: Now that they have to do it, do you think they will actually go forward?
MCINTOSH: You know I don`t. I think the republicans really like to govern by catch phrase because they don`t actually like to govern. The reason why the president spent so much political capital putting the Affordable Care Act and remember how long and awful it was to be a democrat working on the Hill at that moment, that was, that was really intense. He did that, we all did that, because it mattered so much. Because we cared so much about making sure that millions of Americans got insurance who didn`t have it before. We cared about fixing that problem because democrats believe the government can fix certain problems that need to be fixed. Republicans don`t share that belief, at least the republicans today don`t. They don`t believe that government is a solution to the problems that America is facing. So they, they obstruct.
They, they use this catch phrase obstructionism and that`s how they brand their party. Their party is very little more than a brand right now. Now, we have to see them actually implement these tenets. No one is going to be spending political capital to get this done. No one is going to put their name on we`re going to have the replace package here, and if Trump decides to start tweeting that the republicans in congress are doing it wrong, they`re going to turn around and run away faster than it will make his head spin.
REID: Well -- the thing is, there once was a republican health care plan. It`s called Obamacare.
MCINTOSH: Yeah, they did that.
REID: So since democrats took their plan, right, and there isn`t a new plan on the table, they keep saying ""oh no, we`ve got a secret plan, we`ve got a secret plan"", what would be the political you know, importer, or political -- what are the incentive to go through the same senate finance process that we saw democrats go through, to go through that excruciating public horrible process of trying to reconfigure the entire American health care system in public? Would that help republicans at all politically?
MCINTOSH: No, I mean, it certainly didn`t help democrats politically and-- especially when democrats had to do it while republicans were standing there yelling ""death penal and you`re going to push grandma off a cliff"". If we go back to a system where, like congresswoman bass was saying ""chemo patients are kicked off their insurance after a couple sessions"", that is an actual death penal. That you really will have Americans saying I can`t afford life-saving treatment.
REID: Yeah.
MCINTOSH: So you`re going to do it under the guise of real stories being told. It`s not going to be a talking point. It`s not going to be a Sarah Palin blog post. It`s going to be actual Americans who live in the states that these people are supposed to be representing. So there`s this, this other layer that they have to get through which is the political perception of what happens when they yank health care away from millions of Americans who need it.
REID: Well, then there`s the part two, because the thing republicans are actually quite good at is the atmospherics, it`s the staging. And they were able to create this thing called the tea party that started about calling homeowners deadbeats if they couldn`t pay their mortgages but suddenly became this really well-funded faux grass-roots kind of thing, which just went after health care every minute, every minute. It had all the optics that you needed. Do you see evidence that democrats can figure out how to message discipline, get an-you know, adds on the air and actually do the mechanics of politicking?
MCINTOSH: I don`t think that we can replicate the republican strategy because we are bound by principle and we are bound by an ideology that government is supposed to do good for the people that it`s-represented to, or that it`s elected to represent. I don`t think that we can have a Democratic Tea Party. That said, I think that we can do a much better job of sloganeering and running ads and telling real people stories. It`s not about getting everybody to wear shirts that`s say ""Make America Sick Again"". It`s making sure America knows the real-life consequences to their families and neighbors of what republicans are trying to do. That`s the democratic mandate.
REID: And I do believe now we have Anton Gunn, a health care strategist who used to be with the Department of Health and Human Services. So Anton, let`s talk about sort of the practical things, what democrats would actually be showing the country is happening as ObamaCare is rolled back. Can you talk about how -- can you possibly unwind this law without -- and leave in place, let`s say, leaving somebody who`s 26 on your insurance? Can you do both those things?
ANTON GUNN, HEALTH CARE STRATEGIST AND FORMER HEAD OF THE OFFICE OF EXTERNAL AFFAIRS AT THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES: You can`t do both things. See, the biggest problem is most people have no full understanding of all the incredible things the Affordable Care Act has done over the last six years because they`re not having the conversation with the right people. If you talk to any CEO that runs a large hospital in any major metropolitan area, whether you`re talking about Detroit, in Henry Ford, or you`re talking about Tulane Medical Center, these are major health care systems who are taking care of the people who now have coverage because of the Affordable Care Act. These are people who are getting treatment for very important life-saving conditions that will all go away if they try to undo this law.
So, you can`t just say you want to do one part and can`t do the other because there`s so many benefits beyond the insurance. We love to talk about the under 26. We love to talk about a 20 million people who now have coverage. But what about the mom who had a baby and was finally covered after her first child wasn`t covered at all and she had to pay out of pocket $17,000 because her pregnancy was considered a pre-exist condition? What about the father who didn`t get a double bypass when he need it and passed away because he didn`t have health insurance coverage? These people are now getting treatment all across the country and so you can`t undo parts of it. You can`t undo the fact that we`ve improved the quality of care that people received in healthcare because the ACA put so much more of framework around delivering value for people who are using health care services, improving doctors` ability to deliver care at a higher quality so that people can actually get better faster and live the lives that they want and deserve.
So, all of this conversation around we got multiple plans. Well, if you`ve got multiple plans, that means you don`t have a plan at all. And so you can`t repeal the ACA and leave this gaping hole in a health care system that has been reformed, I mean, it`s almost like the conversation about whether you should eat broccoli and spinach. Everybody knows broccoli and spinach is good for you. And what the republicans are trying to get us to do is understand that we don`t need broccoli and spinach, they want to give us a happy meal box, but they`re not going to tell us what`s in the happy meal box. But what I`m clear about, broccoli and spinach is good for you whether you like it or not and happy meals are not good for you at all. So we got to get beyond this conversation and the rhetoric and get deeper into what the law is actually doing to save people`s lives.
REID: But here`s the thing, because, you know, happy meals are really well advertised as well. I mean, Anton, very quickly, why didn`t the administration advertise all these great things years and years ago so that people felt the value and understood the value of the Affordable Care Act. I mean, you have southern states that are letting rural hospitals close rather than take the expansion of Medicaid because they`ve been able to convince their own citizens who are suffering that it`s better to suffer than have Obamacare. Why wasn`t all this message rolled out before?
GUNN: Well, see, that`s the funny thing. We did roll all of these messages out before. We spent a lot of time doing it. But the problem is, when you spend a billion dollars trying to confuse, distract and dissipate the whole idea that health care reform needed to be done and the benefits of the law, it`s hard to fight those messages. When you have members of congress that are willing to go on television and radio shows and tell bold-face lies about the, you know, what the Affordable Care Act is but have no clue about it, it`s hard to beat against that. And we did everything in our power to try to convey those messages but frankly most of the American public didn`t want to hear those messages. They`re into the catch phrases, as we heard, they`re into the 142nd characters, but it`s hard to talk about payment reform and delivery system reform in 140 characters. It`s hard to talk about in a snapshot and a sound bite.
But it`s easy to talk about it when you talk to a family who`s gotten life- saving treatment at a place where they were uninsured five years ago. They walked into the emergency room. They could not get treatment that they needed but now they`re getting care and they`re getting better. And so I`ve talked to these CEOs and health systems, I`ve talked to the leaders who run hospitals, I work with a lot them and they believe the Affordable Care Act means a whole lot to them and it`s allowing them the opportunity to do what they do best, and that is to save lives. And I`m not talking one or two lives, I`m talking tens of millions of lives in cities all across the country.
REID: Yeah, well we do know for certain that now, that the uninsured rate in 2009 was 16.4 percent, now it`s 10.9 percent. I wish we had more time, one word answer for each of you Anton and Jess, yes or no, do republicans fully repeal and not replace the Affordable Care Act or do they repeal and replace it? Yes or no do they repeal it, Anton?
GUNN: They`re going to repeal it. I believe they`ll do that. Yes.
REID: Jess?
MCINTOSH: No.
REID: All right, bold prediction from Jess McIntosh. Anton Gunn and Jess McIntosh, thanks to both of you.
And still ahead, Obamacare is just one of the battles democrats are preparing for in the Trump era. Up next, California takes bold moves to brace for the incoming President, recruiting a former U.S. Attorney General. And later, Donald Trump`s self-imposed deadline for repealing allegedly new information on the Russian hacking has come and gone.
The incoming president escalated his fight today with his own intelligence agencies, meanwhile. So inside Donald Trump`s love affair with WikiLeaks ahead.
REID: Opponents of Donald Trump, particularly frustrated liberals, are looking for ways to properly channel their anger and their deep foreboding into a strategy for fighting back. Not just against Trump but against also the 115th congress which is likely to make their agenda, Trump`s agenda, along with threatening even cherished programs like Medicare. And perhaps the strongest challenge comes from the world`s sixth-largest economy -- the state of California. Already, the University of California System has said that it would fight Trump on immigration. U.C. President, Janet Napolitano, said in a statement last month that the university would ""vigorously protect the privacy and civil rights of the undocumented members of the U.C. Community"".
And Governor Jerry Brown has vowed to challenge any attempt to -- by Trump to interfere with climate science. But today, in what appears to be a rather exceptional move, the state legislature hired Barack Obama`s former Attorney General Eric Holder to represent them in any legal fights against the new republican White House. It`s a move that seems to signal that California is poised to become America`s liberal front line against the incoming President.
And joining me now is Kevin de Leon, California`s Senate leader. So Kevin, explain to us the process or the decision to hire Eric Holder and how that different -- differences from having or how that`s different from having an attorney general?
KEVIN DE LEON, CALIFORNIA`S SENATE PRESIDENT: Well, thank you very much, Joy, for the invitation. It`s an honor to be here with each and every one of you. I will say right now that we`re confronting a dichotomy of democracy. Where it appears that, it`s something unique in our history, and it appears that the most overt opponent to our state of the state appears to be the incoming head of state, and that is the President-elect, Donald J. Trump. Given the campaign rhetoric, one of the most bruising and controversial polemic and polarizing campaigns in modern political history, we actually thought perhaps this is just campaign rhetoric.
But it`s very clear that our worst fears were being confirmed. After he`s appointed individuals to head up HHS that want to dismantle and eviscerate the Affordable Care Act. When the Kris Kobach, the chief architect of of senate bill 1050 of Arizona is one of his close political counselors and we have someone like Jeff Sessions to be the nominee of the Department of Justice, that sent a very clear message to us in California that these individuals would be -- would pose a clear and present danger to the economic prosperity and the well-being of the values and the people of California. So that`s why we have secured the legal services of the recent former attorney general of the United States, Eric Holder. We`re very proud that he will be representing us, providing legal strategy and counsel and he`ll be working very closely with the incoming attorney general as a legal team. I think the more legal firepower the better for the state of California and for the people of California.
REID: Well, it`s certainly unprecedented. And of course Xavier Becerra is going to be the attorney general replacing Kamala Harris. So, you walked us through, why Holder? Tell us what, from California`s point of view, are, let`s say the three most pressing issues. The things you`re most worried about. You ticked off a few, but what are the three areas of greatest concern for Californian?
DE LEON: Three areas of greatest concern in California obviously is health care, the ACA. We have 6.5 million Californians of every single hue, every geographical area in the state, who had benefitted greatly from the ACA. If, in fact, Tom Price and Donald Trump moves forward by eviscerating, and the republicans in--on the Hill by eviscerating the ACA, you`ll have 6.5 million Californians who will no longer have any access to any type of health care. This is equal to a middle-class tax increase on Californians who have to foot the bill for people end up in the emergency rooms for their care. That is the big issue. And that would be a big economic blow for California, because we have roughly about 200,000 jobs in the health care service industry that directly related to ACA.
Second thing, is climate change, environmental protections, the clean air that we breathe into our lungs, the clean water that our children drink every single day. If they roll back regulations and actually dirty our air with more harmful toxic pollutants, people are going to get sick, especially children. And lastly--
REID: The third thing?
DE LEON: The third thing is separating children from their mothers which is massive deportations. Expanding the criteria of who is a violent criminal felon and actually making mothers and nannies, you know, criminal felons and separating children from their mothers. So those are three big issues for us in California.
REID: Yeah, well, Kevin de Leon, one out of eight Americans live in California, sixth-largest economy in the world. So it could have a huge effect on the rest of the country. As California goes, so maybe goes the nation. Kevin de Leon, thank you very much for being with us.
DE LEON: Thank you very much.
REID: And coming up, why Donald Trump would take the word of Julian Assange over U.S. intelligence. A look at Trump`s recent love for WikiLeaks after this quick break.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Did Russia give you this information or anybody associated with Russia?
JULIAN ASSANGE, EDITOR-IN-CHIEF OF WIKILEAKS: Our force is not a state party so the answer for our interactions is no.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
REID: WikiLeaks Chief Julian Assange in an interview on fox news last night, denying the Russian government was the source of thousands of hacked Democratic Party emails released by Wikileaks during the campaign. Notably, Assange specifically rules out that his source was a quote ""state party"". Meaning, he didn`t exactly say the leaks had no connection to Russia.
Nevertheless, his denial seems to have impressed one Donald J. Trump who used his favorite means of communications to state this morning -- to state this morning, ""Julian Assange said, a 14-year-old could have hacked Podesta,"" Hillary Clinton`s campaign chair -- who is Hillary Clinton`s campaign chair, ""why was DNC so careless? Also said Russians did not give him the info!""
One might ask why the soon to be President of the United States would take the word of the guy, said to have leaked stolen American emails over the conclusions of the entire U.S. Intelligence Community, delivered with utter unanimity and about as much as certainty as you can get in matters like these. By the way, today was the day that Trump said that he would reveal his own secret information about the hacks, still no word on that. And this isn`t the first time that Trump has appeared to favor Assange and his organization. During the campaign, he repeatedly hailed Wikileaks for releasing information that hurt his opponent, Hillary Clinton.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENTIAL-ELECT: This just came out. This just came out. Wikileaks, I love Wikileaks. Wikileaks has provided things that are unbelievable. Boy, that Wikileaks has done a job on her, hasn`t it? Oh, we love Wikileaks. Boy, they have really -- Wikileaks. Wikileaks. Wikileaks.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
REID: But it was just a few short years ago that Trump was singing a very different tune. In 2010, Wikileaks released hundreds of thousands of military communications and diplomatic cables which, at the time, were seen as damaging to the U.S. Trump was asked about it backstage at Fox News.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: He claims it will be on, he`ll talk about Wikileaks. You had nothing to do with Wikileaks.
TRUMP: No, but I think it`s disgraceful. I think there should be death penalty or something.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
REID: Same goes for Fox News host, Sean Hannity, who flew all the way to the U.K. this week to interview Assange at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London where the Australian has been living since granted asylum there in 2012. Assange still faces extradition to Sweden on charges of rape and sexual assault.
Hannity has been full of praise for his interview subject, including once telling Assange ""I do hope you get free one day."" But it was a very different story back in 2010 when he devoted an entire segment to questioning why the Obama administration had yet to put Assange behind bars.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
SEAN HANNITY, FOX NEWS HOST ""HANNITY"": These are real lives that are now in jeopardy and in danger. That was step one. Then 390,000 other documents were released, many of them classified documents and now we have this. What is -- why? Why didn`t they go after this guy? Why didn`t they arrest him? Why didn`t they stop this from being published when we had so much time to do it?
(END VIDEO CLIP)
REID: Even Sarah Palin, who was herself hacked by Wikileaks in 2008 and who later called Assange, quote, ""An anti-American operative with blood on his hands"" even she did an about-face today, actually apologizing to Assange on her Facebook page. She apologized.
Not even -- not every Republican is jumping on the Wikileaks bandwagon. Today House Speaker Paul Ryan called Julian Assange, quote, ""A sycophant for Russia."" Well, Senator Lindsey Graham had a forceful message for Donald Trump.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM (R), SOUTH CAROLINA: I hope the president-elect will get his information and trust the American patriots who work in the intelligence community who swear oath and allegiance to the Constitution and not some guy hiding from the law who has a record of undercutting and undermining American democracy.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
REID: Tonight, a new report suggests Trump`s friction with the intelligence community is not just rhetorical. The president-elect`s plans for the U.S. top spy agency next.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You take on the intelligence community they have six ways from Sunday of getting back at you. So even for a practical supposedly hard-nosed businessman, he`s being really dumb to do this.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: What do you think the intelligence community would do if they were motivated to?
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I don`t know, but from what I am told they are very upset about how he has treated them and talked about them.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
REID: I`m joined by Congressman Adam Schiff, Democrat from California, and a ranking member on the House Intelligence Committee. Congressman, thank you for being here.
I will pick up and ask you the same question that my colleague Rachel Maddow asked Chuck Schumer. You sit on the Intelligence Committee, what has been the reaction of the leaders of the intelligence community to just being essentially spurned by the incoming president?
REPRESENTATIVE ADAM SCHIFF (D), CALIFORNIA: I think people are really incredulous that he continues to take the side of the kremlin that essentially he disregards what the intelligence community has to say of the enormous consensus among the intelligence agencies that basically because the facts are at odds with his own preferred version of events, he is going to shun and ignore what the intelligence community has to say.
I`m running out of adjectives and expletives to describe the situation. It`s really so appalling and here he is taking the side of Julian Assange, you know, I think what it does show more than anything else is that in Donald Trump`s world, you`re for him or against him.
Here during the campaign what the Russians did was helpful, he`s not going to bite the hand that fed him and what Wikileaks did was helpful and so he`s going to praise them, but as you saw in those clips that you played of Sean Hannity before and after, Donald Trump before and after, there`s no consistency here at all far from it.
One final point I would make because I think the president spoke to this so eloquently during his press conference a couple weeks ago, what we are seeing here is such a hyper-partisan environment within the GOP that they are willing to overlook all the qualms that they have about Russia over the last half century or more.
They`re willing to overlook the way that Julian Assange has endangered our national interests. If it`s good for the Republicans and bad for the Democrats and that is a terrible development in our democracy.
REID: Congressman, do you get the sense that is lasting? That Republicans and Donald Trump are going to continue to have this fealty or to give Russia a huge pass on even spying on American and hacking into American e- mails and give Assange a huge pass? Do you think that`s lasting or do you think it`s temporary because they don`t want Donald Trump`s election to seem invalidated?
SCHIFF: I think it`s temporary because a lot of the members of the House and some in the Senate have districts or states where Trump is more popular than they are, they`re still afraid of their own shadow, but you have courageous GOP member who are speaking out, people like McCain who are not going to sit idly by while Trump takes actions that are unamicable to our national security and cozy up to the kremlin. I think others will find their voice too.
REID: Congressman, in closing, there is a report in the ""Wall Street Journal,"" they`re reporting the incoming Trump administration is looking to actually make serious restructuring, a change both the director of National Intelligence Office to essentially cut it and also make changes and restructuring to the CIA.
Cutting back on staffing at the Virginia headquarters, moving people into field posts, that kind of thing. That seems alarming and a response, maybe, to what Donald Trump doesn`t believe or believes from the intelligence agency. What do you make of those proposals?
SCHIFF: I think that`s exactly right. If this ""Wall Street Journal"" report is accurate, under the guise, ironically, of saying we want to depoliticize the office of the director of National Intelligence or the CIA, what the president-elect would be doing is exactly the opposite, would be politicizing it, would be effectively punishing the intelligence agencies for speaking the truth. Punishing them for speaking out about Russian interference in our democracy. That would be a terrible step.
REID: Yes, it would certainly be unprecedented. Congressman Adam Schiff, thank you very much.
SCHIFF: Thank you.
REID: Thank you. Coming up, top celebrities are making big plans for inauguration day -- to do just about anything but attend the actual event. Why Donald Trump can`t stand the celebrity snubs, ahead.
Plus, tonight`s ""Thing 1 and Thing 2"" starts right after this break so stick around.
REID: ""Thing 1"" tonight, after congressional Republicans ill-fated attempt to gut the House Office of Congressional Ethics, we`ve heard a lot about the cases of corruption both large and small that Congress`s independent watchdog has investigated over the years.
Today, we learned some interesting details about a hair-raising investigation by the oversight office that involves a GOP congressman and his pet rabbit. That story is ""Thing 2"" in 60 seconds.
REID: Just yesterday, the House Office of Congressional Ethics survived an 11th-hour attempt by the new Republican Congress to gut its oversight powers. Already we`re seeing the benefits of having a watchdog overseeing the behavior of those in Congress.
For the past year, the OCE had been investigating Congressman Duncan Hunter, that`s him vaping during a congressional hearing, for misuse of campaign funds. The investigation into Congressman Hunter`s alleged misuse of funds has been public for some time now.
But thanks to a comment made by his office in response to questions about the OCE, we now know that one of the things Representative Hunter was specifically being investigated for was spending $600 of his campaign`s money on, quote, ""in cabin rabbit transport fees.""
In other words, the congressman spent $600 in campaign donations on airfare for his family`s pet rabbit. Rascally. Now a spokesperson for Representative Hunter`s office told a local paper that the $600 rabbit ride was mistakenly charged to his campaign account and that might be true.
But how to explain some other expenses that the OCE as well as the Federal Elections Commission have been investigating? Expenses like $1,300 in steam video games spent over the course of two months. Another alleged mistake his office blamed on his teenaged son or how about nearly $300 in food from Jack-In-The-Box. Also a mistake.
The $1,200 in utility bill payments, also a mistake. The list of mistakes goes on and on. So far, the congressman has yet to repay his campaign upwards of $49,000 and the full report is set to come out some time soon, perhaps forcing the poor Hunter family rabbit to fly coach.

REID: So for all his efforts to sell himself as a supremely successful businessman and author of books on being a successful businessman, Donald Trump has always sold himself as a celebrity, a showman. That`s been a very important part of his persona to who he thinks he is.
Why else would he star in ""The Apprentice"" and ""Celebrity Apprentice?"" And it clearly bothers him that having attain it had presidency he feels he`s being robbed of the celebrity praise and affection he feels his new standing deserves.
The frustration was showing when Trump tweeted ""Jackie Evancho`s album sales have skyrocketed after announcing her inauguration performance. Some people just don`t understand the movement.""
Although what Trump calls skyrocketing others call a bump that coincided with a TV appearance that she had made. The 16-year-old`s ""America`s Got Talent Season 5"" runner-up is one of the few entertainers who have accepted an invite to perform at the Trump inauguration.
So has country band, ""Big and Rich,"" and now with his inauguration just 16 days away, Trump can really start fuming about comparisons to his predecessor, President Barack Obama, who had performers like Aretha Franklin sing at his actual inauguration.
And at the inaugural concert had Denzel Washington, Bruce Springsteen, Mary J. Blige, Tom Hanks, Garth Brooks, and U2, and that`s literally naming just a handful of the huge superstars from his first and second inaugurations.
Beyonce, by the way, Queen Bey was involved in both Obama inaugurations, both. When we return, Donald Trump is feeling disrespected. That`s next.

BILL O`REILLY, FOX NEWS HOST: The harsh truth is there is reverse McCarthyism going on in the entertainment industry. The evidence is there`s nobody booked.
CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER: Because they don`t want to --
O`REILLY: It`s two weeks away.
KRAUTHAMMER, SYNDICATED COLUMNIST: They don`t want to play for Donald Trump.
O`REILLY: Bull.
KRAUTHAMMER: This is a republic.
O`REILLY: Bull.
KRAUTHAMMER: You are not summoned to perform for the king or for the dictator. In some places if Kim Jong-Un calls you to sing you better show up.

REID: Celebrities refusing to participate in the Trump inauguration is getting plenty of attention. Joining me now, Nancy Jiles, a contributor for CBS News ""60 Minutes"" --
NANCY GILES, CONTRIBUTOR, CBS ""SUNDAY MORNING"": Sunday morning.
REID: That`s right. And Randal Pinkett, winning contestant on ""The Apprentice,"" which was hosted by one Donald J. Trump. Thank you for being here. I have added you to other shows.
GILES: I love it.
REID: Correct your check. I`ll go to you first, Nancy, on this. It`s a bitter shad and fruid (ph), I am sure, of people in the left that Donald Trump cannot pull celebrities the way Barack Obama did or really George W. Bush did for his inauguration. But is there anything to this idea put forward, let`s give him a break --
GILES: The Bill O`Reilly idea?
REID: It`s not that they don`t want to perform for Donald Trump, but they`re afraid that somehow the left will destroy them.
GILES: No, there`s nothing to it. And who would have ever thought in the history of my life I`d be sitting here with the two of you saying I agree with Charles Krauthammer. That`s really weird.
Bill O`Reilly is locked in the `50s where at that time the studio heads did have a lot of power and there were fears of being on the wrong list or accused of being a communist and people lost work and did control their talent.
Now come on, the stars control things way more than the studios do and it`s a funny thing. If you start your campaign by saying Mexicans are drug dealers and rapists, if you say things to black people like your lives are hell, what do you have to lose?
If you say mean things about women, about grabbing their body parts and saying that`s all right, it might offend people and make them not necessarily want to lend their talents to your presidency. It`s weird, isn`t it?
REID: Who`d have thunk it? Randall, the other spin coming out of Trump world is that Donald Trump doesn`t want those people, he wants the people. He wants Jackie Evancho because she`s the movement. Do you -- knowing Donald Trump, having worked with Donald Trump and been on the show with him, do you think it`s legit that he really doesn`t care whether celebrities show up?
RANDAL PINKETT, FORMER WINNER, ""THE APPRENTICE"": No, no Donald`s ego is damaged right now. It`s bruised and an ego that can fill the room, right. So there`s no mystery that he wants the most famous inaugural celebration and he has to be fuming right now and what I`ve heard is we know Mark Burnett is producing the inauguration.
REID: Who produced ""The Apprentice.""
PINKETT: And he brought in Suzanne Bender, a former ""Dancing with the Stars"" and ""American Idol"" producer at the last minute to pull off a Hail Mary to try to get some celebrities to sign on because they`ve had such a difficult time doing it. So I know Donald`s ego feeds off celebrity. It fed off ""The Apprentice,"" it fed off ""Celebrity Apprentice"" and he`s not happy with the way things stand --
REID: What do you think he`s blaming it? Do you think that Donald Trump is capable of admitting that maybe the kind of campaign he ran and attacks on these groups offend people in the arts community who have lots of LGBT people and people of color?
PINKETT: Yes, I don`t think Donald will give the entertainment community the credit they deserve from the standpoint I think people are really standing on principle and you could look at the opportunity that they might have to gain favor with Donald, we`ve seen that with the auto industry.
And for them to decline in my opinion when the opportunity to perform at the inauguration has always been considered an honor, to decline that means you must be standing on principle because you could have incredible publicity.
REID: And Nancy, what do you think it says on the other side of it that there has been so much cohesion in the arts community in opposing Trump?
GILES: I`m happy to hear that. It gives me hope because it`s been a hopeless kind of time for me since the election and I`m glad to know people that are creative and open and want to express themselves and create art and move this world forward in many ways are united against hateful speech. At the very least, even if it turns out he doesn`t believe anything he said he still ran his campaign on smut, basically, smack.
PINKETT: Right.
GILES: And that don`t play with the arts.
REID: Yes, indeed. And I have to ask you before we go, Randal, there`s been a big sort of to-do about Talladega`s marching band, a historically black college, their band was supposed to perform, a lot of alumni are not happy about it, it`s in my social media feed. The president said the school hadn`t decided. Do you know whether they`ll perform?
PINKETT: The last report I got was that the Talladega marching band will perform at the inauguration. There was a big debate amongst alumni and students, many on the side of saying the school should not perform because it would give the appearance of support of the president, which is the big issue we`re talking about and the last report I heard is they will perform.
GILES: Wow.
REID: Well, we shall see because there won`t be a lot of them. There are no D.C. bands. Nancy Giles and Randal Pinkett, thank you both. That is all for ALL IN this evening.
THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED."
0	43	 44 von 72	MSNBC	January 4, 2017 Wednesday	 HARDBALL	 5:00 PM EST	"HIGHLIGHT: Donald Trump is engaged in an unprecedented effort by an American president to undermine the press. The war on Capitol Hill over the future of the Affordable Care Act, Obamacare, was raging tonight. Today, President Obama in a rare appearance on the Hill huddled with Democrats over how to prevent Republicans from killing his landmark achievement

"	"CHRIS MATTHEWS, HOST: Trumping the media.
Let`s play HARDBALL.
Good evening. I`m Chris Matthews in Washington on what has been a very busy day up in the Capitol.
Anyway, President Obama and Vice President-elect Mike Pence were both on the Hill today meeting with members of their respective parties. Mike Pence held what is described as a pep talk, focusing on killing ""Obama care."" The president huddled with Democrats, strategizing to save the health care law.
Meanwhile, President-elect Donald Trump continued his assault on the U.S. intelligence committee (sic). Overnight, he tweeted, ""The intelligence briefing on so-called Russian hacking was delayed until Friday. Perhaps more time needed to build a case. Very strange."" A senior intelligence official told NBC the tweet was disturbing and adversarial.
Trump also continued to bash the media, of course. He did so even as he promised to hold a press conference next week, his first since last July. Well, Trump tweeted, ""Somebody hacked the DNC, but why did they not have hacking defense like the RNC has? And why have they not responded to the terrible things they did and said? A total double standard. Media, as usual, gave them a pass."" 
He even quoted the hacker Julian Assange calling American media coverage, quote, ""very dishonest."" Trump added to that, ""more dishonest than anyone knows.""
Trump`s engaged in an unprecedented effort by an American president to undermine the press. So how does accountability work without a free media? Good question.
David Corn is Washington bureau chief for ""Mother Jones"" and MSNBC political analyst, and Frank Bruni is a columnist for ""The New York Times.""
I want to start with David, then get to Frank. It seems to me that what he`s doing is replicating what Vladimir Putin -- Vlad the Impaler -- is doing. Putin wants to diminish democracy in this country so that he won`t look so bad. And this guy is trying to silence or mute credibility for the media so that people will listen to Trump.
DAVID CORN, ""MOTHER JONES,"" MSNBC POLITICAL ANALYST: What you have with Trump is a blend of narcissism and authoritarianism. I think he believes he is never wrong, although he has, you know, been called out for lying or misstatements by the fact checkers more than any other candidate. He doesn`t want accountability.
At the same time, he`s trying to undermine this institution we have, the free press, which presidents often find inconvenient...
MATTHEWS: Yes.
CORN: ... in order to sort of preserve his ability to say whatever it is that pops into his head and that he tweets and posts. He doesn`t want to have a check for narcissistic reasons and authoritarian reasons.
MATTHEWS: Frank, it makes sense for a president, whether he`s a right wing or left wing or somebody in the middle, or whatever Trump is, to challenge opinion in the media, like what you write. I mean, that`s what they do. They challenge -- that`s what Agnew did when Pat Buchanan wrote his lines, attack the somewhat liberal commentators.
But this guy is not attacking commentary, opinion. He`s not criticizing somebody who might disagree with me, he`s challenging the facts of what the hard news is producing, the wire services, the networks, the metropolitan quality newspapers. What is that about?
FRANK BRUNI, ""NEW YORK TIMES"": Well, he doesn`t even engage the facts at times, Chris. I mean, one of the things that he`s doing, I think, to an extent that we have not seen from a politician at his altitude is he is going so far in describing us as utterly biased, utterly untrustworthy, just despicable, despicable people. And when he does that, he doesn`t have to address the specifics of a given story.
And we saw this toward the end of his presidential campaign. Someone would come out with terrific reporting on the way his charity operated or something like that, and he would never really rebut the exact charges because he would just put it all under the umbrella of, Oh, the dishonest media, they hate me, you can never trust them, and then he moves on from there.
MATTHEWS: Well, what are people to make -- they pick up ""The Times"" and they read a football score from last weekend, 29-20, the Redskins lost. OK. Do they think that`s questionable? And the movie starts at 7:00 tomorrow night. Do they believe that? At what point -- I`ll go to you, David. Are people being told, dog trained, if you will, not to believe facts? Not opinion, facts.
CORN: Well, this is the problem we`ve had. We`ve had throughout this campaign and in the years up to now alternative realities. And whether it`s on climate change, is a good example, or other issues, he`s just taken it to the Nth level of saying the facts that are presented by experts, by the media, by other politicians are not even real facts.
All you have to do is go on Twitter to find people say again and again, whether it`s ""pizza-gate"" or gun control statistics, that what you`re reporting, that what the experts are saying, that what the statistics show are not true. And the only reason you`re doing that is because it`s an agenda. He`s taking this to a new level...
MATTHEWS: Bottom line, what`s he want?
CORN: He wants the ability to not be questioned or challenged by anyone.
MATTHEWS: Anyway, by the way, attacking the media was a staple of Donald Trump`s campaign. Let`s watch.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Even our enemies back there -- look at all that press!
(BOOS)
TRUMP: Among the most dishonest people in the world.
They`re bad people. They`re bad people and they`re dishonest people! They don`t tell the truth. They don`t write the truth.
I love it! We just took the press credentials away from the dishonest ""Washington Post.""
Crooked CNN. CNN is so disgusting!
""The New York Times"" is disgusting. The good news is it`s failing. It`ll be out of business within three years!
It is a failing newspaper.
It`s third rate people, I`m telling you, third rate. Bad people. Bad people. Sick people.
There`s something happening! They`re not reporting it. Katy, you`re not reporting it, Katy. But there`s something happening, Katy! There`s something happening, Katy!
I just don`t respect her as a journalist. I have no respect for her. I don`t think she`s very good. I think she`s highly overrated. She gets out and she starts asking me all sorts of ridiculous questions, and you know, you could see there was blood coming out of her eyes, blood coming out of her wherever.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
MATTHEWS: So there`s nowhere lower to go than this, Frank. But you know, I keep thinking of that guy that was -- that biographer that was weird enough, or odd or naive enough to go on the golf course down there so that Trump could throw him off the golf course!
I mean, is Trump going to throw the media out of the press room, I mean, if they disturb him? I mean, there is a sort of a tyrannical aspect to this.
BRUNI: Absolutely. I mean, that reel was great because it showed all the things that he`s done and is doing that go beyond what other politicians who`ve had an adversarial relationship with the press have done. He has taken away people`s credentials. He has demonized, vilified and gotten into shouting matches, essentially, with individual members of the media. We haven`t seen that before.
And let`s also not forget that he said during the campaign that he`d love to make it a lot easier to sue for defamation and things like that. So he`s going well beyond what a politician who simply says the media`s not trustworthy -- he`s going well beyond what we`ve seen so far.
MATTHEWS: I`m thinking about accountability now, and the bottom line, not just who has a tough day because he yells at them. Fine. That`s part of our job, to take some crap. But you look at what the American people benefited from. Watergate, Woodward and Bernstein,if that -- I always say it would have been much worse if they`d gotten away with it, Nixon and those people, because then he would have moved on to the step. They would have escalated from there, more -- you know, for more dirty stuff.
And the same thing with the Tow missiles going to Iran under Reagan. If we -- if nobody had caught that, where would we be? It`s the job of the media to catch the big, bad stuff. And Trump seems like he`s immunizing himself against -- as you were saying, immunizing himself against a credible news story that he`s got a conflict, that he was on the phone one day fixing some deal somewhere when he`s president, if that ever happens.
CORN: Look, well, we know that there are, you know, myriad conflicts of interest that have not been resolved that the journalists, ""The New York Times,"" ""Washington Post,"" have reported on, and he keeps ducking this issue. And now he`s going to say that these sort of stories, the stories about his foundation, have no basis because the people writing them are sick, bad, disgusting people.
He doesn`t get to the details. He only talks in headlines and slogans that are red meat for his conservative base.
MATTHEWS: Well, it gets worse. Donald Trump`s now quoting Julian Assange, of all people, as his new hero. According to video in 2010 uncovered by CNN today, Trump said WikiLeaks was a disgrace. That`s what he said back then. It`s changed.
Here he is in the old days.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Klayman (ph) will be on. He`s going to talk about WikiLeaks. You had nothing to do with leaking of those documents.
TRUMP: No, but I think it`s disgraceful.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You do think it`s disgraceful?
TRUMP: Look, there should be, like, death penalty or something.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
MATTHEWS: Death penalty for WikiLeaks! Anyway, Julian Assange -- anyway, someone else who seems to have had a change of heart on WikiLeaks, Sarah Palin. Back in 2010, she wrote, ""Assange is not a journalist, no more than the editor of al Qaeda`s -- no more than the editor of al Qaeda`s new English language magazine is. It`s not a journalist. He is an anti- American operative with blood on his hands.""
Now Palin, as of today, has a different message with Assange. Here`s what she says. ""Exposing the truth regarding the left having been, oh, so guilty of atrocious actions and attitudes of which they`ve falsely accused others, the media collusion that hid what many on the left have been supporting is shocking. This is important information that finally opened people`s eyes to democrat candidates and operatives would not have been exposed were it not for Julian Assange.""
Frank, the changing partners and dancing here is so fast, it`s hard to keep up with. Assange is now a hero to the Trump world.
BRUNI: You`re a hero to Trump if your message on a given day is something that dovetails with his self-interest. I mean, that`s nothing new. We`re in really scary territory here in a lot of ways.
I want to get back to something you asked David before about facts. It`s not just that people are now having arguments about what is and isn`t a fact. We have Americans who are living in entirely different universes in terms of the facts they`re exposed to. We`ve all so siloed ourselves and segmented ourselves...
MATTHEWS: Yes.
BRUNI: ... and live in these curated news environments. So I worry, like, when we come out with some of the kinds of important stories that you mentioned before -- there will be big stories like that, big investigative scoops during the Trump administration. Will there be an enormous group of Americans who don`t even see that or see it in an entirely different way because they`re living in such a particularly curated news environment that`s curated to be an echo chamber of their partisan beliefs?
MATTHEWS: Yes, it`s -- what`s that called, stovepiping or...
BRUNI: Yes, self-selecting.
MATTHEWS: You know, I used to worry, Frank and David, about the fact that news organizations, maybe not ""The Times"" but so many, have cut back on their overseas bureaus. And what they do, even the big papers now will refer -- rely on stringers. And you can usually tell by the name where that person`s probably from that country.
But when you start relying on that sort of derivative news, well, you don`t know whether that guy or woman is really a straight reporter. They have -- there could be all kinds of politics going on in their heads. But that`s now seeping back into domestic coverage because if you begin to suspect the motivation of even a straight AP reporter, UPI -- not UPI, AP reporters, Reuters (INAUDIBLE) Agence France...
CORN: Well -- well...
MATTHEWS: ... you`re -- you`re -- you don`t know what the facts are.
CORN: No, this is nothing new because you go back to Jesse Helms -- you remember the days when he ran a campaign against Dan Rather.
MATTHEWS: Yes.
CORN: And the right...
MATTHEWS: Well, I don`t, actually, that one. That one I forgot.
CORN: But the right for long has attacked what they call the mainstream media for being liberal and out of touch and opposed to them. This happened in the Reagan years.
MATTHEWS: Yes.
CORN: This has been around for a couple of decades. Trump is making it more vicious, more personal, more about him than anything else, and that`s where the authoritarian theme comes into this.
MATTHEWS: Yes.
CORN: And the fact that the Republican Party and his base is following him down this path makes me worry a lot, as it does Frank.
MATTHEWS: Well, Frank, thanks for congratulating the editors here for putting that collage together because I really think one thing that does speak truth is if you get the right video, you don`t play with it, you don`t edit, you just show what the guy`s been doing, you begin to get the thrust of it.
And it`s pretty ugly because it isn`t discerning. It`s not saying, Well, this one reporter got a story wrong and he should get bashed. It`s an attempt to try to change power away from truth and to have power defeat truth. And that`s really awful for our country.
Anyway, thank you. Thanks for coming on. I read you all the time, Frank, in ""The New York Times."" And thank you, David Corn. Great work, as always, David.
Coming up -- Trump`s not just at war with the media. He`s also ratcheting up his fight with the intelligence community. We`re going to see now him siding with Julian Assange again and dismissing our own intel experts. That`s got a lot of people mad as hell, people that are really serving, in fact, risking their lives for this country overseas, the real spooks out there, the spies that have to risk their lives.
Plus, the day after Trump`s inaugural, get ready for the mother of all protests. Actually (INAUDIBLE) women`s march on Washington can be the biggest single demonstration of the Trump presidency. That`s if he`s lucky. But it`s going to be big. We`ll get a preview tonight of what`s coming.
And back to that big fight over President Obama`s signature achievement, ""Obama care."" Republicans want to tear down ""Obama care,"" eliminate it, kill it in its crib. But they don`t have much of a plan beyond that. They`re going to leave us with nothing. Obama, himself, by the way, is now leading the fight to save what he built.
Finally, ""Let Me Finish"" with Trump watch tonight.
This is HARDBALL, the place for politics.
MATTHEWS: With the start of the 115th Congress, President Obama`s nomination of Merrick Garland to the United States Supreme Court has officially expired. Garland waited 293 days, but Senate Republicans refused to even consider him, something White House press secretary Josh Earnest called a scar on the Senate`s reputation.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
JOSH EARNEST, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: The fact that he was not given the opportunity to explain to the Senate and to the American people why he would have served the country honorably and with distinction on the United States Supreme Court is a scar on the reputation of the United States Senate. It is a part of the legacy of Republican leadership in Congress from the last several years, and I don`t mean that as a compliment.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
MATTHEWS: Well, I`m going to compliment Josh Earnest because he`s one of the best, best press secretaries in a long time.
Now Donald Trump will get to nominate Justice Scalia`s successor. It will take 60 votes, of course, in the Senate to confirm. But Democratic leader Chuck Schumer, however, has already signaled the party won`t play ball on not filibustering.
And we`ll be right back after this.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
TRUMP: Hacking is a very hard thing to prove, so it could be somebody else. And I also know things that other people don`t know, and so they cannot be sure of the situation.
QUESTION: Like what? What do you know that other people don`t know?
TRUMP: You`ll find out on Tuesday or Wednesday.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
MATTHEWS: Welcome back to HARDBALL. That was President-elect Trump on Saturday saying he`d reveal more information about the Russian hacking by today. However, no new information has been forthcoming from the president-elect.
And now Trump is again taking aim at the U.S. Intelligence community, publicly questioning their certitude when it comes to the Kremlin`s cyberattacks. After saying he planned to meet with intelligence briefers this week, Trump last night suggested on Twitter that intelligence officials needed more time to get their story straight.
Reacting to Trump`s statement last night, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer issued this warning to the incoming president.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY), MINORITY LEADER: You take on the intelligence community, they have six ways from Sunday at getting back at you. So even for a practical, supposedly hard-nosed businessman, he`s being really dumb to do this. From what I am told, they are very upset with how he has treated them and talked about them.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
MATTHEWS: Well, today, Trump further tweeted in defense of Julian Assange, who released the stolen documents on his Web site, WikiLeaks. Quote, ""Julian Assange said a 14-year-old could have hacked Podesta. Why was DNC so careless? Also said Russians did not give him the info.""
Well, that tweet earned Trump a strong rebuke from former CIA spokesman George Little, who said, quote, ""Let`s stare this reality square in the face. The president-elect is pro-Putin and believes Julian Assange over the CIA. On January 20th, we will be less safe."" Well, that`s strong.
Joining me now is Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee. And she today introduced a bill calling for an independent commission to investigate the Russian hacking.
Well, you`re a political leader. You may be president someday, Senator. So I`m just going to ask you why anybody who`s about to be president of the United States would dump on, pee on, to be crude about it, his incoming G2, his intelligence arm, his ability when he gets up in the morning to know what the North Koreans are up to, what Putin`s up to, what`s going on in the Middle East? This is the only way he knows more than the average person that -- his intelligence community. Why would he dump on them -- to start with?
SEN. AMY KLOBUCHAR (D), MINNESOTA: You know, I cannot explain the reasoning of Donald Trump`s tweets. What I do know is there are people out there putting their lives at risk every day for America, basically putting their lives on hold. They`re under cover. They`re finding out information for us. And when we have 17 intelligence agencies coming out and telling us that this cyber -hack occurred, it`s real. And I just came back, as you know, from Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, Georgia, and Ukraine, where they have seen Russian aggression in a way that I don`t think in our country we can imagine.
They illegally annexed Crimea. They have gone into about 20 percent of the territory in Georgia. And the people in these countries, the leaders, when Senator McCain and Senator Graham and I visited there, told us they have seen this movie before. It`s not just the physical invasion.
For decades, Russia has responded to anything they don`t like by cyber- attacking. When Estonia had the audacity to move a bronze statue to a cemetery, and Russia saw it as a dis, they actually then cyber-attacked and shut down their Web access.
And when Lithuania invited some members of the parliament from the Ukraine -- from Ukraine, from the Crimea area to their country, as a showing of solidarity, Russia attacks their parliament`s computers.
This has happened. So, this is not just about, Chris, one political party being hurt or one election in America or even one country. This is a modus operandi and it is an assault on democracy. And we better start seeing it that way, especially when our own intelligence community...
MATTHEWS: Yes.
KLOBUCHAR: ... is telling us undeniably that this happened.
MATTHEWS: Well, this is a weird question to ask, but I am kind of taken with it.
Chuck Schumer, who is a smart guy, he is your leader now. Chuck Schumer said he better with careful with what he`s doing because the intelligence community has a way to whack back at him. That`s sort of dishonorable in itself. How can they whack back or hurt Trump?
KLOBUCHAR: I don`t know.
(CROSSTALK)
KLOBUCHAR: I think that`s kind of a New York way of talking. In Minnesota...
MATTHEWS: Was that just rhetorical?
KLOBUCHAR: What I would say is that they will stand up for their facts and their findings. And I hope that that`s what happens at this briefing that will occur this week.
And perhaps, when the president-elect hears the fact that -- the facts that our own president has heard and will continue to hear while he`s still in office, he will change his tune, because I think when you have senators like former candidates for president for the Republican Party like John McCain and stalwart Republicans like Lindsey Graham who are standing up and saying, this isn`t a partisan issue, this is about America`s security, because when you are attacking our election, you don`t just attack democracy, you attack the very freedoms on which we stand in our Constitution.
MATTHEWS: I know.
KLOBUCHAR: From the freedom of the press, which you just discussed, to the freedom of assembly and speech.
MATTHEWS: Well, I wish I was a fly on the wall during your CODEL with McCain, because I would love to hear what he and Lindsey have to say about this new president.
Anyway, ""The Washington Post"" -- I know you know.
""The Washington Post"" is today reporting that Republican Congressman Dana Rohrabacher of California plans to bring a congressional delegation over to Russia to meet with a member of Russia`s parliament, the Duma -- quote -- ""Rohrabacher said Russian leaders were eager to meet with U.S. lawmakers to talk directly about the sanctions and many other lingering political tensions.""
""The Post"" also notes that the congressman -- quote -- ""was coy when asked whether his group would meet with Putin. `I really can`t say,` he said, after a pause and a half-smile. `It`s possible.`""
Well, this comes after Rohrabacher said month that the illegal hacking was justified by the Russians because of the information it provided about Hillary Clinton.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
REP. DANA ROHRABACHER (R), CALIFORNIA: What is worse? Hillary destroyed e-mails that were under subpoena and she destroyed them. What`s worse...
(CROSSTALK)
ANDREA MITCHELL, NBC CHIEF FOREIGN AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT: And does that justify what Russia did to...
ROHRABACHER: Then the Russians hacking in and giving us those e-mails? No, the destruction of the e-mails by Hillary was a far worse crime against the American people. She`s trying to keep information from the American people.
And if the Russians or whoever it was hacked into that system and gave the American people that information that Hillary had tried to destroy, more power to whoever.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
MATTHEWS: Well, here`s a fact that you didn`t hear there.
Senator, there is no evidence ever by anyone at any time that the Russians ever hacked into Hillary Clinton`s e-mails. So I don`t know what he`s talking about.
Anyway, what do you make of that comment by him? This is like the enemy of my enemy is -- so, if the Russians take the side of a Republican against the Democrat, then, of course, they`re our new allies against the Democrats.
This is strange.
KLOBUCHAR: I`m not going to relitigate these Hillary e-mails right now. I want to look at the threat that`s before us.
And the congressman is, of course, welcome to go to Russia and meet with whoever he wants to. That really wasn`t an option for our delegation, since Senator McCain has been banned by Vladimir Putin from going to Russia.
But I hope the congressman will see what we saw when we stood on the front line in East Ukraine with those brave Ukrainian soldiers. They have lost 10,000 people, 10,000 people, since Russia has come into their territory. And they have taken a ramshackle group of just regular citizens, turned them into a functioning military, and are standing every day up for their country and up for their right to be an independent democracy.
And I -- when they talk about these sanctions, the sanctions are incredibly important for all of those Baltic nations that for 25 years have tried to have their own democracies, their own countries, separate from Vladimir Putin`s.
MATTHEWS: Yes.
Thanks so much, Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota.
KLOBUCHAR: Thank you.
MATTHEWS: Senator Lindsey Graham today slammed Trump for his tweet this morning about Julian Assange, saying he would soon propose additional sanctions against Russia. This is Lindsey Graham. Here he is.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R), SOUTH CAROLINA: Not only should he ignore Julian Assange. He should condemn him for what he`s done to our country, putting our soldiers at risk, putting our foreign policy at risk.
Julian Assange is no friend of America and he`s no friend of democracy. So, sanctions are coming, president-elect Trump. I hope you will, after Friday, understand that the Russians did interfere in our election.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
MATTHEWS: Well, this comes as Trump allies like Sarah Palin have warmed to the WikiLeaks founder, Julian Assange, and praised him publicly.
I`m joined right now by Malcolm Nance, MSNBC intelligence analyst and author of the book ""The Plot to Hack America.""
Let me ask you about just your general view of what we have been talking about, the fact that Trump is now aligning himself rhetorically with the former KGB agent Vladimir Putin, and basically all these Republican guys joining the side of Julian Assange, who many would have thought was something of a traitor, not a traitor, but certainly enemy agent. And now they`re all the best buds with these people just because they have made the Democrats be embarrassed over some e-mails.
MALCOLM NANCE, NBC TERRORISM ANALYST: Well, at one point, I just thought this was going to be all bread and circuses for Donald Trump just to go out with whatever name is the most popular out there, Julian Assange, to piggyback onto that, and then use that information, and then grow up at some point.
It appears that that is not going to happen. He is viewing Assange, and certainly through Sean Hannity`s interview with Assange, as a serious player who has done him a favor. And he is paying that favor back with praise. I find it very, very confusing and actually very alarming.
MATTHEWS: Well, I know politics makes strange bedfellows, but this is ridiculous.
And the question I have is -- I mean to ask you about the real-life impact. You`re in the intelligence world. You work it every day. You`re not making a ton of money. I remember, when the CIA tried to recruit me in grad school, they say, we don`t pay as much as any other agency, so this isn`t going do be any fun for anybody.
They wanted somebody to the study of the Soviet economy. I didn`t really take the job.
But, anyway, what do you make of the morale over there at Langley and other places, Defense Intelligence, now that they have a new president who`s dumping on them?
NANCE: Well, I can tell you, I speak to people across the broad spectrum of the intelligence community every day. And certainly the communications that I have right now is nothing but stunned.
I mean, they are absolutely stunned that they have a president-elect of the United States who not only doesn`t believe them, but who actually traffics in conspiracy theory and claims that he gets his own information from other sources and people, and that the U.S. intelligence community is not going to be trusted by him.
He mocks them. He ridicules them. I had Kellyanne Conway personally assure me in one breath that she was going to -- Donald Trump would be respecting the intelligence community, and five minutes later go out and insult the intelligence community.
MATTHEWS: Well, she`s not a clairvoyant.
NANCE: No.
MATTHEWS: She`s not a clairvoyant. No, you can`t figure out what he`s going to say five minutes later. Anyway...
NANCE: Well, that was her own opinion.
But, for the most part, it`s the aura that is around the Trump -- incoming Trump administration that the intelligence community is going to have a rough ride.
MATTHEWS: Who do you think he`s hearing from?
I mean, Hillary Clinton had Sid Blumenthal. Does he have Ron Dermer? Does he have ambassadors? Does he have friendly people -- he seems to be very friendly with Israel. Is he listening to them?
Who`s he listening to? Who is he even claiming to listen to? Or do you think he`s just making it up?
NANCE: To tell you the truth, no one knows who he`s listening to. It`s possible that he`s listening to General Flynn, retired General Mike Flynn.
MATTHEWS: Yes.
NANCE: But he has a whole myriad of other people who are pulling his ear and giving them what they think the world view is, from ""The National Enquirer"" out to Infowars and other conspiracy theorists.
And then I think, at long last, he just pops it off the top of his head, and that`s what it is. The world doesn`t operate like that.
MATTHEWS: I know.
NANCE: And the intelligence community cannot produce products for a consumer that will just throw them into the trash.
MATTHEWS: Let`s put this under the file of what he told us when he was examining whether Barack Obama was an illegal immigrant or not, from Africa, somewhere.
He said: I have got people out there investigating this and they`re bringing me some really powerful stuff.
All made up.
NANCE: Yes.
MATTHEWS: Malcolm, all made -- that never happened. He never had any private investigators. He never had anything on Obama. And then eventually one day, he said: Oh, yes, he`s a citizen. I was wrong.
What?
Anyway, thank you, Malcolm Nance. You know your stuff. And you know the world out there that we don`t know.
NANCE: Well, thank you.
MATTHEWS: Up next: It`s the biggest demonstration tied to Donald Trump`s inauguration so far. We are going to get a preview of the Women`s March on Washington. Remember the men`s march on Washington, Million Man.
We will be right back on that. We got an expert.
And this is HARDBALL, the place for politics.
MILISSA REHBERGER, MSNBC CORRESPONDENT: I`m Milissa Rehberger. Here`s what`s happening.
More than 100 people were hurt when a commuter train hit a bumping block at a station in Brooklyn, New York. As many as 700 people were on board at the time of that crash.
Convicted Charleston church gunman Dylann Roof is representing himself in the penalty phrase of his trial. He told jurors earlier that there`s nothing wrong with him psychologically.
And heavy snow closed the main highway between Reno and Lake Tahoe. Parts of Colorado and Utah are expecting at least two feet -- back to HARDBALL.
MATTHEWS: Welcome back to HARDBALL.
Well, on January 21, one day after Donald Trump becomes president, nearly 200,000 people are set to gather at the U.S. Capitol to demand that women`s right and human rights are honored.
The Women`s March on Washington, it`s called, which name evokes, of course, the legacy of historic marches in the past, was the brainchild of one woman from Hawaii.
Dejected by the results of the election, she turned to social media to see if women would march on Washington en masse. Three months later, the answer was a resounding yes, and she handed over responsibility to four national co-chairs and nearly 60 organizations of women.
I`m joined right now -- it`s one of the big-timers, the president of EMILY`s List, Stephanie Schriock, which is tonight announcing that you are?
STEPHANIE SCHRIOCK, PRESIDENT, EMILY`s List: Yes, EMILY`s List is honored to officially sponsoring the Women`s March on Washington.
MATTHEWS: OK. So, you`re jumping on this. You`re going to be part of this thing. I went to the Million Man March back then. It was largely an African-American affair, but it was amazing and actually pretty exciting to be down there on the Mall.
SCHRIOCK: It was. I remember that.
MATTHEWS: What do you think will be the impact, tangible impact, of say, 200,000 women showing up in D.C.?
SCHRIOCK: Well, I think it`s extraordinary.
I mean, first off, what has already happened is extraordinary. I mean, this is a grassroots effort of incredible energy. And you`re right. It started with...
MATTHEWS: One woman.
SCHRIOCK: ... one woman in Hawaii. These four wonderful, smart, energetic women of color who are co-chairing are just rising stars.
(CROSSTALK)
MATTHEWS: Well, they have the furthest to go, too. They have got to come from Hawaii to Washington.
SCHRIOCK: That`s true.
(CROSSTALK)
MATTHEWS: But when it`s all over, and somebody has to clean up the mess afterwards, and everybody goes home, and the grass gets trampled, and you go home...
SCHRIOCK: This is just the beginning. It`s just the beginning.
MATTHEWS: What do you think would be something you would like to see on your agenda after this?
SCHRIOCK: Well, for 30 years, EMILY`s List has been inspiring women to run for office. And that`s why we`re getting involved with the march.
We really see future candidates coming to Washington on January 21, and want to encourage those women to go back to their communities and run for office. And if they -- and if they want to run, call EMILY`s List. If they don`t want to run, stand up with the women who are running. We need more women`s voices.
(CROSSTALK)
MATTHEWS: OK, 54-42 among women for Hillary Clinton in the last election, was that a good spread, 54-42? Was that good enough? It was not quite enough. It was for the popular vote.
SCHRIOCK: Well, yes, I was going to say, she did win the popular vote by nearly three million.
And we have got more work to do. And we know that. But there`s great energy. I knew it was there during the campaign. And I will tell you, this is just the beginning. We are getting people calling in to run.
MATTHEWS: Who`s the best prospect of a woman for president to run against Trump? Anybody? Amy Klobuchar? Who`s on the list?
SCHRIOCK: It`s a good, good question. I think that we have got a strong pipeline.
MATTHEWS: Is Warren going to run?
SCHRIOCK: I don`t know, but she should think about it.
Kirsten Gillibrand from New York. We have got some rising stars. But we just swore in four incredible women in the Senate yesterday, Kamala Harris, Catherine Cortez Masto.
(CROSSTALK)
MATTHEWS: It`s time to build the bench. It`s time to build the bench.
SCHRIOCK: They`re there. They`re coming.
MATTHEWS: The job is open.
Thank you, Stephanie Schriock of EMILY`s List.
SCHRIOCK: You bet.
MATTHEWS: Up next: President Obama rallies Democrats on Capitol Hill. Republicans have put his signature achievement, Obamacare, on the chopping block. They want to kill it in the next couple days, as soon as they get in.
Anyway, we`re going to talk about the risk of getting rid of Obamacare and leaving the patients with nothing.
You`re watching HARDBALL, the place for politics.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY), SENATE MINORITY LEADER: Republicans are plotting and soon will be executing a full-scale assault on the three pillars that support the American health care system. The Affordable Care Act, Medicare and Medicaid. The Republican plan to cut health care wouldn`t make America great again. It would make America sick again.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
CHRIS MATTHEWS, MSNBC ANCHOR: OK. Welcome back to HARDBALL.
The war on Capitol Hill over the future of the Affordable Care Act, Obamacare, was raging tonight. Actually today when President Obama in a rare appearance on the Hill huddled with Democrats over how to prevent Republicans from killing his landmark achievement.
According to reports, President Obama gave Democrats marching orders, catch this line. ""Don`t rescue,"" that was his line, ""Don`t rescue Republicans on mistakes they`ll obviously make repealing Obamacare."" And also, he told them to start referring to the GOP`s new plan as Trumpcare, meaning nothing will be Trumpcare.
At the same time, Vice President-elect Mike Pence met with House Republicans standing side by side with Speaker Paul Ryan, and they promised to begin the process of repealing and -- well, they say replacing the law. Let`s watch.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIPS)
MIKE PENCE (R), VICE PRESIDENT-ELECT: We are 16 days away from the end of business as usual in Washington, D.C., but the first order of business is to repeal and replace Obamacare.
REP. PAUL RYAN (R-WI), SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE: We have a plan to replace it. We have plenty of ideas to replace it. The point is in 2017, we don`t want people to be caught with nothing. We want to make sure that there`s an orderly transition so that the rug is not pulled out from under the families currently struggling under Obamacare while we bring relief.
(END VIDEO CLIPS)
MATTHEWS: Well, he`s thinking.
Anyway, after President Obama left the building, Democratic leaders hit back at the Republican plans. Here they go.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIPS)
SCHUMER: Republicans will soon learn that you can`t keep the good parts of the ACA and remove the rest of the law and still have it work. Now, I see the president-elect who`s tweeting again this morning. He said Republicans shouldn`t let the Schumer clowns out of his web. Well, I think Republicans should stop clowning around with the people`s Medicare, Medicaid and health care.
REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA), HOUSE MINORITY LEADER: The former speaker once said, politics is local. Well, in this case, all politics is personal. Now, the Republicans say repeal and replace. The only thing that has going for it is alliteration. They have no replacement plan.
SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (I), VERMONT: Donald Trump said he will not cut Social Security, he will not cut Medicare, he will not cut Medicaid. Donald Trump has got to come forward, maybe through tweets, one of his tweets, and say, clearly, that Donald Trump will veto any legislation that cuts Medicare, that cuts Medicaid, or that cuts Social Security.
(END VIDEO CLIPS)
MATTHEWS: Anyway, let`s bring in the HARDBALL roundtable. Bob Cusack is editor in chief of ""The Hill"" newspaper. Tamara Keith is NPR`s White House correspondent. And Sahil Kapur is a reporter with Bloomberg.
Anyway, let`s get going on this. Let me go to the former president -- current, he`s not former yet, Barack Obama. Don`t rescue them. Don`t give them a helping hand if they`re screwing up the legislation or does he mean, just don`t help get anything done? How broad is that?
BOB CUSACK, THE HILL: I think don`t help them at all. Oppose them at every turn. Now, Democrats have lost a lot of seats because of Obamacare. Democrats I talk to feel like, hey, the politics could change here because they actually have to make law. Not just oppose. They`ve got to repeal and then replace and they don`t really have a replacement plan. We haven`t seen the details of that.
MATTHEWS: That could be a problem. What`s the delay going to be between the time they kill this baby in its crib and the people who are diabetics like me sitting around when they don`t have any medical care, they don`t have the pharmaceuticals or insulin, what`s really going to happen here?
TAMARA KEITH, NPR: Well, it`s not entirely clear because the mechanisms aren`t all set up yet.
MATTHEWS: Yes, but if you`re a person, you want it to be clear.
KEITH: Absolutely, you want it to be clear. I think there`s some disagreement among Republicans about whether they need to present to the American public along with repeal, this is the direction we`re headed with replacement or whether they -- one Republican who is close to Donald Trump said he believes they have about six months after repeal to come up with a replacement.
MATTHEWS: Six months.
KEITH: But then potentially, you know, that`s just saying what they would do. Actually passing that legislation could take much longer and if Democrats don`t help, it could take an eternity.
MATTHEWS: Tamara, that`s a lot of worry time for older people.
KEITH: Absolutely.
SAHIL KAPUR, BLOOMBERG: The big problem is Republicans do have various pieces of legislation and various blueprints but nothing with any kind of unified support in the party.
KEITH: Do they have 218 votes for any of this stuff?
KAPUR: Nowhere close to 218 votes. I`d be surprised if they had a fifth of that. You have disagreements within House Republicans. You have disagreements between House Republicans and Senate Republicans. Committees disagree on the stuff.
They`ve had six years. The reasons Republicans have not come up with a replacement with unified party support is that doing so without conservative principles, without the mandates, without the rules, without subsidies, mean stripping coverage from a lot of people and they have not come to terms --
MATTHEWS: Bob, they do know, or do they not, they`re playing on the Democrats` field? That this with Democrats are really, rally good at. When they`re at their worst, the Democratic Party, who I used to work for, are really good at defending Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and now Obamacare, because the 60-year-old person who voted for Trump may consider themselves a wild and woolly conservative but they need all these programs.
CUSACK: Well, I mean, Republicans like talking about national security, like talking about tax reform.
MATTEHWS: Crime is a favorite.
CUSACK: Crime. Right.
Health reform really not in their bailiwick, though they did pass a Medicare drug bill in 2003. Overall, though, that`s where Democrats think, OK, we can turn the tables on them, but, and that`s where the issue is going to come on the timeline, when does the repeal take place? Is it two years, or three years, or four years?
MATTHEWS: Oh, I see.
CUSACK: The conservatives want it in two years, before the next election.
KAPUR: I`ve even heard four years. There`s been discussion about putting it off after the 2020 election because they don`t want this big disruption, right, before the vote --
MATTHEWS: They want the political credit for axing it but not having it gone.
Tamara, your thoughts about this? Who wins this battle? A year from now, will we have Obamacare or will we have Trumpcare?
KEITH: Well, something will -- Democrats sure that hope it`s re-branded as Trumpcare. You know, I think we for a while are going to relitigate the same fight --
MATTHEWS: I can only hear the word, relitigate, one time a night here, OK? Amy Klobuchar, it`s over.
KEITH: Oh, gosh.
MATTHEWS: That`s one of the new years of 2016. I think it should say good-bye.
KEITH: It`s just not going to go away for all that fight.
MATTHEWS: Here`s the big question. We have eight people in the Supreme Court right now. Looks like we`re going to have eight people in the Supreme Court for a while because it takes 60 votes in the U.S. Senate, which is three-fifths of the Senate has to agree on one person. It ain`t going to happen because the conservative Republicans will never allow a moderate nominee, and the Democrats will probably vote against anybody.
So, how are we going to get a U.S. Supreme Court with nine people on it so that a tie can be broken? The beauty of nine is, you can have a 5-4 decision.
KEITH: I think that Chuck Schumer when he came out last night and said we could block someone for this long, for the whole time --
MATTHEWS: OK. Here he is.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
SCHUMER: We are not going to settle on a Supreme Court nominee. If they don`t appoint someone who`s really good, we`re going to oppose them tooth and nail. It`s hard for me to imagine a nominee that Donald Trump would choose that would get Republican support that we could support. So you`re right.
RACHEL MADDOW, TRMS HOST: And so, you would do your best to hold the seat open?
SCHUMER: Absolutely.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
MATTHEWS: This is sort of third-world stuff, when the two political parties can`t agree that Supreme Court nominees have to be somewhere near the center to get them approved now.
KEITH: I think what he`s doing is Trumpian negotiating, where as Donald Trump has often done is you take the hardest line then, you know -- but why would Chuck Schumer, you know, compromise now?
MATTHEWS: Ask all three of you, will we have nine people on the Supreme Court at the end of this year?
CUSACK: Yes, because the red state Democrats are going to vote with Trump on this one, I think, yes.
MATTHEWS: Red state Democrats.
KEITH: I think --
KAPUR: I agree with that.
MATTHEWS: Well, OK. You guys are ahead of me on this one.
KAPUR: Maybe by the nuclear option.
MATTHEWS: Democrats feel that their seats are in jeopardy if they don`t go along with the president`s proposal.
KAPUR: Or Republicans will change the rule or get rid of filibuster for Supreme Court.
MATTHEWS: Do you believe it or not? Don`t play games here.
KAPUR: One way or another --
MATTHEWS: No, no, do you believe that will happen?
KAPUR: I think there will be nine justices by --
MATTHEWS: You believe they`ll have a 60-vote requirement --
KAPUR: If Democrats filibuster their justice, I think they`ll do it.
MATTHEWS: Well, you`re giving me conditions that answer your question but the answer is you don`t know.
KAPUR: I don`t know. I don`t know the answer to that.
MATTHEWS: Thank you.
The roundtable`s sticking with us.
And up next, they`re going to tell me something they do know that I don`t know. That`s part of the show that`s getting very good lately.
This is HARDBALL, the place for politics.
MATTHEWS: Well, President Trump has named another nominee to office with ties to Goldman Sachs. Today, Trump tapped Wall Street lawyer Jay Clayton to lead the Securities and Exchange Commission. Clayton has represented the Goldman Sachs and Barclays Capital and follows Treasury nominee Steve Mnuchin, head of the economic council, Gary Cohn, and chief strategist Steve Bannon to the new administration, all worked for Goldman.
Also today, Trump announced the former ""Apprentice"" contestant Omarosa Manigault will join the White House team in a role expected to focus on -- of course -- public engagement.
And we`ll be right back.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
MATTHEWS: Time for the HARDBALL round table.
Bob, tell me something I don`t know.
CUSACK: Senate Democrats face a tough math, 22 of the 33 seats are up in 2018. Senate Democratic leaders want to know from all the Democratic senators, make sure you tell us whether you`re running for reelection or not. Good news is a lot of red state Democrats have said they are running for reelection.
MATTHEWS: Dianne Feinstein running again?
CUSACK: Oh, yes. Yes, I think so.
KEITH: President-elect Donald Trump tweeted he`s going to have a press conference -- of course, he`s done that before, tweeted he`s going to have a press conference and it didn`t happen. He is breaking with a lot of precedent of his predecessors. George W. Bush held 11 press conferences in a shortened transition. Barack Obama held 18. If Donald Trump held a press conference everyday from now until inauguration, he would not hit that mark.
MATTHEWS: What`s he going to say, ""welcome disgusting people""?
KEITH: It will be great.
(CROSSTALK)
KAPUR: His last press conference was July 27th, by the way. But what I wanted to say is one of the big problems Republicans will have in repealing Obamacare is that if you repeal the protections for pre-existing conditions which is a big unpopular part of the law, 12 out of the 14 states that have the highest prevalence of people with pre-existing conditions are red states that voted for Donald Trump, a 13th is Maine where he won one electoral vote. This is a real dilemma for Republicans I think --
MATTHEWS: The people in most need voted for Trump.
KAPUR: Yes.
MATTHEWS: Anyway, most need of the government.
Anyway, thank you very much, Bob Cusack. Thank you, Tamara Keith and Sahil Kapur.
When we -- great group. When we return, let me finish the Trump watch tonight. It`s somewhat jocular but frightening.
You`re watching HARDBALL, the place for politics.
MATTHEWS: Trump Watch, January 4, 2017.
""Are you going to believe me or your lying eyes?"" Well, that was Mr. Groucho Marx way back when, back when saying something like that sounded funny. Well, now, President-elect Donald Trump is saying this -- are you going to believe me or what you`re reading in the newspapers? He`s telling his backers that they shouldn`t believe what they read or get from the network news because it`s not true.
What he, Donald Trump, is saying that`s what they should believe.
Well, this is really something different. Spiro Agnew made fun of political commentators on TV, the people who commented on the president`s speeches, he called them mattering nabobs of negativism. Or rather, Pat Buchanan who wrote the speeches called them mattering nabobs of negativism. Agnew was a mattering nabob of what Pat Buchanan wrote for Agnew to natter about.
Anyway, it`s not who natters, it`s what matters. Trump said he`ll hold a news conference this week, I assume he`ll invite the press to cover it. Will he begin the exercise however by calling everyone there disgusting? Because that`s what he`s been doing. And why do you think?
Well, the same reason his friend Vlad the Impaler over there is relentlessly dumping on our democracy because it reduces the competition. If people think less of what they read in the papers or get for the evening news, they`ll be a bit more likely to ignore its criticisms of one Donald Trump, incoming president of the United States, just like if people think less of our American democracy, they may begin to think what Russia has is not so bad after all. Nice tactic, Vlad the Impaler, nice tactic, Donald the imitator.
That`s HARDBALL for now. Thanks for being with us.

PETER ALEXANDER, MSNBC HOST: Yes, it`s Wednesday.
The new chapter of the Obamacare fight begins.

MIKE PENCE, VICE PRESIDENT-ELECT OF THE UNITED STATES: The first order of business is to repeal and replace Obamacare.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
REP. PAUL RYAN (R), U.S. SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE: We don`t to want pull the rug out from people while we`re replacing this law.
SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D), NEW YORK, MINORITY LEADER: Our Republican colleagues don`t quite know what to do. They`re like the dog who caught the bus.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
ALEXANDER: Plus, the president-elect hits the intelligence community again. Is this a fight Donald Trump really wants?
And altered states. The North and South Carolina state lines have moved and it`s really hitting home for some, literally.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This side of the master bed, South Carolina. This side of the master bed, North Carolina. No joke.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
ALEXANDER: This is MTP DAILY, and it starts right now.
(on camera): Good evening. I`m Peter Alexander in Washington tonight, in for my friend, Chuck Todd. Welcome to MTP DAILY and welcome to the jungle inside this new Congress, beginning the year with a block buster brawl over President Obama`s signature legislative achievement.
Today, the ongoing president and the incoming vice president descended on Capitol Hill to rally their troops in a showdown over the future of your health care.
On one side, Obama and Democrats fighting to protect the president`s health care law. On the other, Trump, Pence and Republicans vowing to kill it and replace it.
But House Republicans are far from unified over how to do that. Leadership is floating a two-step plan, repeal it now, figure out the replacement later.
Of course, that poses serious complications and it has some Republicans threatening to abandon ship on the whole thing.
The lack of unity inside the Republican caucus was apparent at their news conference today with Vice President-elect Mike Pence. There were virtually no specifics given to reporters on the critically important issue of replacing the law if it gets repealed.
Instead the news conference was, at least at times, a bit of a therapy session about how much Republicans don`t like Obamacare.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Everything President Obama promised about health care has failed.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: He came here and said, if you like what you have, you can keep it. I hope he comes here to apologize for those broken promises. But I don`t think that`s what`s going to be the case.
RYAN: This law has failed. Things are only getting worse under Obamacare. The health care system has been ruined, dismantled under Obamacare.
PENCE: Obamacare has failed. And it has been rejected by the American people.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
ALEXANDER: Meanwhile, Democrats who have been swept out of power since Obamacare was signed into law aren`t exactly signaling an entirely constructive approach either.
At their news conference on Capitol Hill today, the Senate`s top Democrat, Chuck Schumer, seemed to wash his hands of the whole mess, telling Republican that they won`t have Democrats to blame anymore if the whole thing goes sour.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
SCHUMER: So, our biggest problem was that once ACA passed, people attributed every problem they had with the health care system, whether they were part of ACA or not to ACA. And our Republican colleagues and their message machine did it.
Now, they`re going to own it. And all the problems in the health care system. And there have been many throughout the years. No one has solved all of them, are going to be on their back. And they want to repeal it and then try to hang it on us. Not going to happen. It`s their responsibility, plain and simple.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
ALEXANDER: President-elect Trump fired a preemptive shot at Schumer`s strategy, warning Republicans not to let Democrats turn the tables on them.
In a series of tweets this morning, Trump told them, quote, ""Don`t let the Schumer clowns out of this web. Dems are to blame for the mess."" To which Schumer replied.

SCHUMER: I think Republicans should stop clowning around with the people`s Medicare, Medicaid and health care.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
ALEXANDER: OK. So, it appears that a seriously consequential debate about the future of American health care has already turned into a name-calling blame game over a plan that doesn`t yet exist. Because Republicans aren`t sure what to do and Democrats aren`t about to help them figure it out.
Before Republican leadership puts together a plan to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, they`re probably going to need to get this guy on board. Congressman Jim Jordan from Ohio. He`s a member of the House Freedom Caucus.
He has expressed serious concerns about Ryan`s two-step strategy and his caucus has the numbers, certainly, to make some noise.
Congressman Jordan, appreciate your being with us.
REP. JIM JORDAN (D), HOUSE FREEDOM CAUSUS: Good to be with you today, Peter.
[17:05:00] ALEXANDER: So, let`s talk about what the House Freedom Caucus wants. Will it kill the current two-step plan being proposed by leadership, that basically says repeal Obamacare now, then figure out a replacement later?
JORDAN: No, we`re not saying that. We`re just saying we need to get rid of Obamacare.
Look, I think health care will be better and less expensive when Obamacare is completely repealed. That`s what the voters expect us to do. That`s what they sent us here to do. That`s what we plan to do.
And then, let`s put in place a model that is market-oriented, that is patient-focused, consumer-focused, family-focused, doctor-focused, not Washington-focused as is Obamacare.
That`s what our plan is. That`s what we think needs to happen. And it should happen as quickly as possible.
ALEXANDER: So, the bottom line is, over the course of six years, the Republican Party held 60-plus votes to repeal Obamacare. Was there was no plan to replace it at any point during that time? Does that still not exist?
JORDAN: There have been a number of plans put forward. The one by Dr. Price whose likely to be the next health and Human services secretary. A good man. A guy that I -- a colleague and a good conservative member of Congress.
There`s the plan put out by the Doctors Caucus that Phil Row put out earlier today that is a good plan, that focuses on just what I talked about. Focusing a model on patient-centered, doctor-centered, family- centered. Not what this -- not what Obamacare is.
And never forget, this was a plan that every promise we were told turned out to be false. Everything they said, like your plan, keep your plan. Like your doctor, keep your doctor. Premiums go down (INAUDIBLE.)
ALEXANDER: Congressman, let`s break down some of the -- we`ll break down some of the -- certainly. Let`s break down some of these (INAUDIBLE) popularity. But to be very clear, you would vote in support of repeal, even if there isn`t a replacement yet said?
JORDAN: Yes, we need to repeal it because that`s what we told the voters we were going to do. I always said, we make this job way too complicated.
Our job is to do what we told the voters we were going to do when they elected us to come here and serve them and their families.
So, we told them we were going to repeal it. Let`s repeal every single bit of it. And then, let`s put in place a model that`s going to actually make health care better and less expensive.
ALEXANDER: So, what`s --
JORDAN: That`s what we are going to focus on.
ALEXANDER: -- so the -- so is that -- the problem is there could be a period of time right there where as many as 12 -- 20, excuse me, million Americans are without health care then?
JORDAN: I mean, you heard the speaker today. He says, we don`t -- we don`t want to quote, in Speaker Ryan`s terms, ""pull the rug out."" And we understand that.
ALEXANDER: And so, basically, repeal and delay is what you`re saying?
JORDAN: You repeal but there`s going to be a phase in time. What we`re saying is make that as short as possible. It shouldn`t be, some, two, three, four-year phase in time. It should happen quickly. It should happen this Congress, this year. That`s what makes sense to us.
The American people understand that. I think anyone understands it. You have to have some time for the market to adjust. So, you can put in, kind of, the plans and the policies that make sense that -- sense that actually help families. That`s what we`re focused on doing.
But it shouldn`t stretch out for years and years and years. It should be done relatively quickly.
ALEXANDER: Understood.
Mark Meadows, a head of the caucus, saying it has to happen during this Congress. You talked about some of the broken promises. They`re also parts of Obamacare that are very popular.
These are all from the most recent Keiser Family Foundation poll. 85 percent of Americans favor the provision, the law allowing young adults to stay on their parents` plan. 80 percent favor the laws, financial subsidies. 80 percent like the laws` option for states to expand Medicaid.
Nearly 70 percent like what it does on preexisting conditions. And 60 percent like the mandate for businesses with more than 50 workers.
So, are you going to get rid of all of that?
JORDAN: I think you repeal the whole thing.
But, look, let`s take a couple of those -- take the 26-year-old, for example. Don`t you think that that -- if there`s that kind of support for and amongst the American people, don`t you think the marketplace will say, well, let`s make sure we have policies that allow that to happen?
If that`s what families want, and if there are young people who want to remain on their parent`s plan.
ALEXANDER: But that stuff didn`t preexist. That didn`t exist. Those preexisting conditions, those folks weren`t covered before Obamacare.
JORDAN: I was talking about the 26-year-old issue, the preexisting.
ALEXANDER: They weren`t covered before.
JORDAN: And don`t you think there`ll be something in the marketplace -- and that is something -- when you think about health care, the one thing that concerns families is something like that where there is a major illness, maybe to one of their children.
And they may have to change jobs. They want to make sure that they`re going to have coverage for that serious illness in their family. Of course, we can work through that. So, there will be some time to do that.
What we`re saying is repeal it because that`s what we told the voters we were going to do.
And then, let`s put in place a model that deals with some of the things you just raised, 26-year-old, the preexisting condition.
But let`s do it in a market-centered, family-centered, patient-centered way. Not what Obamacare is.
Remember, this law passed with not one single Republican vote. They rammed it through. Everyone knows it`s been a disaster for our health care market. And, I think, an impediment to economic growth as well.
Everyone knows it`s a disaster so let`s get rid of it. But we can do the - -
(CROSSTALK)
ALEXANDER: But just a final point on this. To be clear, over the course of six years or 60 plus votes to repeal this, there is still no plan that everyone`s agreed on.
So, you`re saying within two years, your confident you can come together and have that plan implemented?
JORDAN: We have to because that`s what we told the voters we`ll do.
What I also know is there are good plans out there. Some I`ve supported in the past. I`ve been co-sponsored of in the past. Good plans out there that do what I said.
[17:10:00] But the -- you have to start from the premise. Health care will be better and less expensive when Obamacare is gone. Let`s make sure it`s patient-focused and family-focused.
ALEXANDER: Understood.
JORDAN: Not focused on Washington.
ALEXANDER: Congressman Jim Jordan joining us from Capitol Hill. Congressman, thank you for your time.
JORDAN: Thank you.
ALEXANDER: Let`s turn to a member of the Democratic leadership. Senator Debbie Stabenow of Michigan who is the chair of the Democratic Policy and Communications Center.
Senator Stabenow, nice to see you. Just want to first get your response to congressman Jim Jordan.
SEN. DEBBIE STABENOW (D), MICHIGAN: Sure.
ALEXANDER: This is basically what Democrats are up against right now.
STABENOW: Well, Peter, first of all, it`s great to be with you. And, secondly, I would say, I`m not surprised that Republicans didn`t support health reforms that took power away from insurance companies and gave it to people that have health insurance coverage across the country or added insurance.
They didn`t support Medicare either. They`ve been trying since 1965 to rip apart Medicare. And part of their plan -- in fact, part of Dr. Price`s plan that was just touted would cut a trillion dollars out of Medicare and turn it into a voucher.
So, I`m not surprised that there`s not a commitment to make sure there`s affordable health care for everyone.
Let me say a couple of things just on the process. First of all, right now today, Peter, if folks wanted -- and I sat out on the floor today. We would be happy to sit down and talk about ways to make the system better, right now.
You don`t have to repeal what everyone has, all the protections, the ability for women not to be discriminated against in rates, maternity care now covered, --
ALEXANDER: So, Senator, let --
STABENOW: -- mental health now covered. You don`t have to do any of that. We just sit down and we work together.
But what they`re doing is, like, burning down the house because they want a new house.
ALEXANDER: So, what`s the difference --
STABENOW: Making their family, you know, homeless and then saying, well, now, we`ve got to figure out where we`re going live.
ALEXANDER: What significant changes to the law are you willing to make?
STABENOW: Well, first of all, we`re not going to support repealing this. It`s outrageous. To put the entire economy, one sixth of the economy, which is health care, into chaos and instability. Rip Medicare and Medicaid apart. Take away health insurance for people. And every protection and put it all back in the control of the insurance companies. We`re not going to support that.
But if they wanted to talk about, how do we support small business? How do we do things that would make the system more affordable for folks, absolutely. Count us in. But this is not the way to do it.
ALEXANDER: Let`s -- let me play for you a little bit. We spoke earlier to one of your colleagues, Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut today. And it appears that Democrats may be rooting, in effect, for a failure. Take a listen to what he said.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
SEN. CHRIS MURPHY (D), CONNECTICUT: Republicans, right now, a lot of them, think that they can repeal it and then work with Democrats later to fix it.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Is that not a possibility?
MURPHY: No, they own this. If they want to break this, they own it.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
ALEXANDER: So, didn`t Democrats criticize the Republicans for taking that same kind of approach before? How is that constructive?
STABENOW: Peter, first of all, you`re suggesting that we agreed to repeal something that has brought solvency to Medicare, brought down prescription drug costs, --
ALEXANDER: But we agree --
STABENOW: -- helped everybody --
ALEXANDER: The Republicans, alone, can repeal it, I guess I`m saying.
STABENOW: But what you`re saying is what we should --
ALEXANDER: So, how are you going to fix them in do help rebuilding it?
STABENOW: OK. But what you`re saying is that we should accept their premise that expanding health care and strengthening Medicare and Medicaid is a bad thing so we should vote to repeal it in order to fix provisions. That`s ridiculous.
And so, of course, we`re willing to sit down and do that. But not to create a situation where all the power goes back to the insurance companies. They can drop you if you get sick. If you have (INAUDIBLE), diabetes, cancer, Alzheimer`s, they don`t have to give you insurance.
ALEXANDER: Understood.
STABENOW: If you`re a woman, you know, they can discriminate. Mental health and on and on and on.
ALEXANDER: Senator, --
STABENOW: We`re not going to take that away.
ALEXANDER: -- let me ask you one last question. Why should voters trust Democrats on this issue? They`ve had six years to convince them that this law is great, as you indicate. But still, a plurality don`t like it. 45 percent view it unfavorable. Just 43 percent view it favorably, according to the latest Keiser Family Foundation poll.
STABENOW: What people want is to make things better. Not to take away health care for their family or their 22-year-old or their mother with Alzheimer`s or cut back on their medicine.
And so, if you ask folks, do they think it`s a good idea to repeal the whole system and to pull the thread and unravel Medicare, Medicaid and the private insurance system, people will look at you and say, are you crazy? You know, of course not.
But we would like you to work on the parts that need to be fixed. That`s not what they`re suggesting.
So, they own this process. They own the process of doing it this way which is going to hurt millions of people.
ALEXANDER: Senator Stabenow of Michigan. we appreciate your time and your comments. Thank you.
STABENOW: My pleasure.
ALEXANDER: Let`s bring in our panel right now. Ben Ginsberg is a Republican elections lawyer and an NBC News Political Analyst. Michael Beschloss is an NBC News Presidential Historian. And Karine Jean-Pierre is a Senior Advisor with MoveOn.org. Thank you, all, for being with us right now.
[17:15:07] Ben, to you off the -- off the bat. Let`s talk about the divides within the Republican Party right now. Can Donald Trump secure a victory on this one right now? It`s clear they can get the repeal, but do they have the replace on the back end to make this successful?
BEN GINSBERG, POLITICAL ANALYST, NBC NEWS: Well, I think there is a path to do this. It will be repealed. In short order and Republicans have the vote to do that. It probably will stay in effect for a period of time.
And then, as you heard from the interviews, there are a series of things in which the Democrats and Republicans agree should be part of the health care system. And it will be built back up. And that will be the victory.
ALEXANDER: That seems like an optimistic approach right now that it could be built back up. It only takes 51 votes to knock this thing down. It takes 60 votes to succeed in the Senate to rebuild thing.
Isn`t there a pretty good possibility that we repeal it and then we sit in this, sort of, limbo for a period of time and we`re kind of back where we started?
KARINE JEAN-PIERRE, SENIOR ADVISOR, MOVEON.ORG: I think that`s exactly right. I think the repeal is just that. A repeal with nothing in place. We haven`t really heard anything from the Republicans as to what will -- what are they going to put in place?
I think the Obamacare ACA, if you will, needs tweaks not a wrecking ball, right? Last month, we saw a surge in Obamacare. Sign-ups, and --
ALEXANDER: Because people saw the writing on the wall that it was going away.
JEAN-PIERRE: Exactly. And 10s of millions of people are counting on Obamacare. And so, what do you do? You can`t be a limbo stage. That`s not what the American people want. They do want it to be fixed but they don`t want their Obamacare or health care to be gone.
ALEXANDER: Michael, I was trying to pin Senator Stabenow down on this. But what is the role of Democrats in this process then going forward as the minority party? In effect, some would criticize and say they`re doing to the Republicans what the Republicans did to them that Americans were furious about.
MICHAEL BESCHLOSS, PRESIDENT HISTORIAN, NBC NEWS: Might well do. And I think the fascinating thing is going to be see what a difference there is between this and 2009, when you had a president with both houses of Congress but of a different party.
But, this is so dangerous. And this is so interesting because, for instance, 1953, Dwight Eisenhower had run on a promise to repeal Social Security. He didn`t do it, A, because Social Security was a lot more popular in many quarters than Obamacare is.
But the other thing is that people were worried that if that was done and if there was a replacement that did not work, that Republicans would suffer in the next election. The parallel is pretty close right here.
ALEXANDER: Ben, what strikes me is there`s a lot of people who actually benefit by Obamacare that have no idea that they`re benefitting by Obamacare right now. They may benefit by Medicaid expansion, perhaps, or in states like Kentucky that has its own exchange. They don`t call it Obamacare, but that`s how they got it.
There are a lot of people in a state like that who widely voted for Donald Trump, but actually benefit by some of the things that Obamacare provides them.
GINSBERG: Yes, and that`s the healthy part of this debate. In that people will actually focus more on the parts that they do like and don`t like. And that`s part of the process.
What the Democrats are saying they do like. The law gets repealed. You`re going to have to vote for it to come back so you can build a better, stronger health care system in this country.
And there are noticeable failures in the current way the Obamacare is being implemented. Just the premiums, the way they`ve gone up, the exchanges that have failed. It`s a problem.
ALEXANDER: Karine, they say, the Democrats, we heard Chris Murphy, Senator Stabenow said, effectively, the same thing which is, you know, you guys own it now. So, if you break, it`s on your -- it`s in your hands.
JEAN-PIERRE: Hey, you bought it. You own it, right? You break it, you own it.
ALEXANDER: But does that work? Does that actually solve the problem? Are we in this perpetual state of campaigning which basically means we`re waiting until the next elections.
JEAN-PIERRE: But here`s the thing, Peter. For six years, the Democrats have tried to work with the Republicans on tweaking the Obamacare, trying to make it better. And when did they get? Continuous roadblocks.
ALEXANDER: Republicans will say it was stuffed down their throats in the first few months of Obama`s term.
JEAN-PIERRE: Yes, but this is not about them. This is about the country, right? At the end of the day, they didn`t vote for it originally back in 2009, but 10s of millions of people are on health care. Do they not care about the 10s of millions of people who -- a lot of them are, actually, their constituents?
BESCHLOSS: Our system does a lot of things well. This is not one of them. This is a very delicate process. This is going to have huge impacts on millions of Americans.
And to have this happen in this very politicized, angry atmosphere and to have it done quickly at the beginning of an administration, it doesn`t look great.
ALEXANDER: One of the real challenges right now. A lot of people may not be as familiar with how they got their health care. But they know who took it away from them.
BESCHLOSS: Right.
JEAN-PIERRE: Yes. That`s exactly right.
ALEXANDER: Ben, Michael and Karine, thank you very much. We`re going to take a pause really quickly.
Up next, Donald Trump`s war with what in a few weeks will be his own intelligence agencies.
You`re watching MTP DAILY. Stay tuned.
[17:19:50]
TODD: Welcome back.
The biggest jobs still open in the incoming Trump cabinet is the director of National Intelligence. And we can now tell you that former Senator Dan Coats of Indiana is the leading candidate for that job, according to multiple sources familiar with the discussion.
Senator Coats, who did not run for reelection, was a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee. He served in the House, and then Senate in the 1980s and 1990s. Left the Senate and then was elected again in 2010. He served on the Senate Intelligence Committee in the 1990s as well.
Coates met with President-elect Donald Trump at end of November, but he dodged reporters` questions about what position in a Trump administration he might be considered for.
As we wait to find out who will be the next director of National Intelligence, Trump is picking a fight with the current one. And we`ll be back in one minute with that.
TODD: Welcome back.
On Friday, President-elect Donald Trump will meet with the outgoing heads of the NSA, CIA, FBI and the director of National Intelligence for briefing on Russia`s interference in the U.S. election. But the meeting could be a little bit awkward.
Trump began the morning tweeting, the intelligence briefing on so-called Russian hacking was delayed until Friday. Perhaps, more time needed to build a case. Very strange.
Intelligence officials tell NBC News, they`re becoming increasingly disturbed by Trump`s rejections of their agencys` findings. Many say they assumed he would come around or find a way to at least walk the line.
And, tomorrow, one day before he briefs Trump, the outgoing director of National Intelligence, James Clapper, will be testifying on Capitol Hill before the Armed Services Committee at a hearing called by Chairman John McCain. The topic, foreign cyber threats and Russia`s hacking interference in the election.
Joining me now is Andrea Mitchell. She NBC News` Chief Foreign Affairs Correspondent, of course, the host of ""ANDREA MITCHELL REPORTS"" right here on MSNBC.
Andrea, Trump tweeted the briefing was delayed but there seems to be at least a little bit of confusion over that. So, set us straight. What can you tell us?
ANDREA MITCHELL, CHIEF FOREIGN AFFAIRS, NBC NEWS: Well, I can tell you that the intelligence community says that there was no confusion at all. That he was told, his people were at least told in the transition, that it was going to be on Friday. That it was set last Thursday or Friday and it involves not just Clapper, but also the heads of all the other intelligence agencies, including the CIA and NSA and Jim Comey from the FBI.
[17:25:14] So, they were all on the same page. They say that it was Donald Trump`s transition or maybe Trump, himself, weren`t. Although I knew there was at least one official telling one of my colleagues that there may have been some confusion on the intelligence end.
But they say that it was set. That they knew that they all had to appear tomorrow before John McCain. That if they had to brief the president on this Russian hacking report which is just now being turned over to the White House. If it hasn`t already been, it`ll be turned over tomorrow.
Then briefed the so-called gang of eight. The eight leaders in both houses, both parties on the intelligence community, committees rather. And then, brief the president-elect on Friday. That was the schedule.
ALEXANDER: One senior -- one senior intelligence official describing some of the recent Donald Trump tweets as, quote, ""adversarial."" What about Trump`s national security advisors, Michael Flynn his pick for Defense secretary. James Mattis the CIA director pick. Mike Pompeo. What do we understand that they believe, right now, as they head into these new positions likely?
MITCHELL: That`s very difficult to ascertain because prior to a confirmation hearing, they`re not talking. Mike Flynn is believed to be the source of a lot of the hostility to the intelligence communities which, of course, fired him.
Basically, Clapper first appointed him, lifted him up to be the head of the defense intelligence, and then was involved in firing him. So, there can`t be a lot of good feeling there.
But the fact is that the intelligence agency chiefs are universally upset, I`ve been told by very good sources. That they just feel that the community itself, the men and women who work every day, men of them putting their lives on the line here and abroad, are really being dissed by the president-elect in a way that is unprecedented.
There was tension between Richard Nixon and the CIA. He didn`t like the CIA. He didn`t read his PDBs (ph). He returned them with the seals unbroken when he was actually sworn into office.
But, since then, we`ve had much different relationship. And even at points of tension, never anything this public by Twitter, taking policy positions that are so different. `
And, today, siding with Julian Assange --
ALEXANDER: Right, right, right.
MITCHELL: -- who is the founder of WikiLeaks who was considered public enemy by most of the people in the intelligence community and many Republicans on the Hill.
So, I think what you`ve heard already today from leading Republicans, not, of course, the vice president who spoke out, trying to explain what Donald Trump`s saying. But other Republicans led by, you know, John McCain, Lindsey Graham and others are deeply upset about this. And they`re prepared to be somewhat public about it.
ALEXANDER: Andrea Mitchell, thank you very much for that. And you leave us right where I want to pick up with our panel again right now, Ben Ginsberg, Michael Beschloss, Karine Jean-Pierre.
The idea of Julian Assange and how he`s sort of reared his head, once again, into this conversation. Trump praised the WikiLeaks founder on Twitter.
Here is part of what he said, promoting Assange`s appearance on ""HANNITY"" last night and tweeting, quote, ""Julian Assange said a 14-year-old could have hacked John Podesta,"" referring to the chairman of Hillary Clinton`s campaign.
Why was the DNC so careless? Also said, Russians did not give him the info.
Ben, I`m going to put you on the spot here. How do you feel about Donald Trump siding with Julian Assange over his own intelligence community?
GINSBERG: Well, what it`s done is create great rifts within Republicans, as Andrea reported. And this is now going to come down to very much a contest on the Hill to get legislation passed. And this is going to be a distraction among core Republicans from being able to achieve.
ALEXANDER: We`ve been hearing Republicans not afraid to speak out on this. Michael, Lindsey Graham among them spoke to CNN today about Donald Trump`s tweet about Assange. Here is part what he said.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R), SOUTH CAROLINA: Mr. Assange is a fugitive from the law, hiding in an embassy who has a history of undermining American interest. I hope no American will be duped by him. You shouldn`t give him any credibility.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
ALEXANDER: Is Donald Trump getting duped by Julian Assange?
BESCHLOSS: I`d prefer not to get into motives but it is sort of mind blowing because --
ALEXANDER: We`re talking about the unprecedented nature of this moment.
BESCHLOSS: Some of the things that were released have been said to lead to the deaths of many Americans who`ve been -- or at least some Americans who are working for intelligence services.
And, you know, this can`t go on forever. You can`t have a president saying, I just don`t believe what my intelligence services tell me. What if you were John Kennedy 1962? CIA comes in with pictures of something on the ground in Cuba and says, we think that these are Soviet offensive missiles. And the president says, I don`t believe you. I`m not going to do anything.
You know, soon, we will have Donald Trump in charge of these people, making his own appointments. We can`t be in a position where he goes for four years and says, I`m just not going to believe much of what they tell me.
ALEXANDER: So, Karine, let me put up some of the numbers from one our recent NBC News-""Wall Street Journal"" polls. The -- asked about the favorability of the CIA right now. We`ve been asking about it every year since 2002. And this year, it`s the first time that Democrats view it more positively than Republicans. You can see the numbers there for yourself, Democrats, plus 32 percent, Republicans, plus 4 percent. That`s just a chasm all the sudden that exist in the way Americans view these institutions. What position does that put Republicans in right now?
JEAN-PIERRE: Well, I have to say, Peter, it is stunning that the person whose about to get the nuclear codes is siding with Assange, and has more faith in the Russian government than the intelligence community. And it should send a chill down the spines of Americans that we are in such unprecedented times. I mean, we`re basically in a place right now where Donald Trump`s twitter feed is a national security risk. And that`s what the Republicans are going to have to deal with. How they deal with their leader of their party tweeting constantly, you know, and going against the intelligence community.
ALEXANDER: So, Ben, what is the risk here and how do they smoothed this thing over? You`ve still got 15, 16 days to play with, then all the sudden, he`s president.
GINSBERG: Yes, you kind of hope this is the preseason and once the regular season starts, then there`s more.
ALEXANDER: Some people thought the election was the pre-season, this would be the regular season.
GINSBERG: But you get the blue passes on January 20th.
ALEXANDER: That`s correct, that`s correct.
GINSBERG: That`s when it starts. So, the smoothing over of it, I think comes by the reality of the situation which is, these are serious matters, you do have to have intelligence, you do have to trust your own people. And I suspect that`s how it gets smoothed over.
ALEXANDER: What impact does the weight of the office, the oval office when he steps in there barely two weeks from now have on someone like a Donald Trump in terms of tone and rhetoric based on our past experiences.
BESCHLOSS: Oh, I think that we will see at least something of a change. And that`s why I`ve been sort of mystified, why he wanted to get started basically three hours after he was elected with these tweets and, you know, seemingly making policy on Taiwan and all sorts of other, you know, departures from tradition. Why not wait until the inauguration, do that in the White House with your staff there, with the platform or the presidency. I still can`t understand why he did not wait.
ALEXANDER: And there could be fallout here, Rex Tillerson, Lindsey Graham says if he doesn`t agree that the Russians were behind the interference in the election, then Lindsey Graham says he`ll lose his vote.
JEAN-PIERRE: It`s exactly right. It`s going to be a tough confirmation hearing for Tillerson because of his relationship with Putin, and what, you know, Donald Trump has been doing by not agreeing with the unanimous decision of the intelligence community. And he can`t continue to tweet. He has to -- he has to stop tweeting. And because when he`s doing it he`s moving the markets, right, whether it`s the economy, and also he`s putting us.
ALEXANDER: It`s in the markets right now.
JEAN-PIERRE: Yeah, well, we`ll see about that. But also it`s a national security risk to us.
ALEXANDER: Michael, (INAUDIBLE)
BESCHLOSS: No. Once he`s president, he will talk about why is doing this -- why he is doing this at length. He could be pretty persuasive, and when you do it in a 30 minute speech rather than one tweet, you`re not forcing people to guess about.
JEAN-PIERRE: He needs to have a press conference.
ALEXANDER: He`s going to have one next week.
JEAN-PIERRE: We`ll see.
(LAUGHTER)
ALEXANDER: Ben, Michael, Karine, thank you. This Sunday on Meet The Press, Chuck Todd will have an exclusive interview, picking up where we left off, with senators John McCain and Lindsey Graham. They`re going to discuss the push for hearings on Russia hacking, and the recent trip to the Baltic States. Still ahead right here, MTP daily, how did Democrats win back what was once their base, the middle class? You`re watching MTP daily.
ALEXANDER: More MTP daily just ahead. But first, Deirdre Bosa, has your CNBC market wrap.
DEIRDRE BOSA, CNBC: Thanks, Peter. Stocks extended their New Year`s rally, the Dow climbing 60 points, the S&P adding about 13, and the NASDAQ up 48 points. Minutes from the feds most recent meeting, showed some policy makers worrying they may need to speed up future rate increases if unemployment falls faster than expected. U.S. auto sales were strong last month. Sales totaled 18.4 million, well above the 17.7 Million analysts were looking for. And Macy`s shares are sinking after hours after posting disappointing holiday sales. That`s it for CNBC first in business worldwide.

CHUCK SCHUMER, UNITED STATES SENATOR: What`s needed from we, Democrats, is a bigger, bolder, sharper edged economic program that addresses how those struggling to stay in the middle class can stay there. And those struggling to make it into the middle class can get there more easily.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
ALEXANDER: Welcome back. That was Senator Chuck Schumer and his first floor speech as the senate minority leader. He laid out a path forward for his party saying Democrats need to do better about reaching out to middle class Americans. But top Democrats are divided on how to frame that economic message. Some like Bernie Sanders think Dems need to adapt to populist message like the one he used during his presidential bid. Here`s what he told MSNBC, Rachel Maddow, last night.

BERNIE SANDERS, UNITED STATES SENATOR: And what Democrats increasingly understand, you can`t just go to fundraisers with wealthy people. You`ve got to get out in the real world. You have to mobilize people. You`ve got to educate people. You`ve got to listen to people. And that is the transformation they need.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
ALEXANDER: Others like Democratic Leadership Council founder, Al From, saying Democrats need to stick to the core principles that worked during the Bill Clinton era. He writes as reactionary populism continues to tap into the frustration of many voters, anger won`t improve our nation. A constructive way forward for the Democratic Party and the country is achievable if we can remember our first principles of opportunity, responsibility, and community, and further them with bold ideas and modern means. Al From, founder of the Democratic Leadership Council and a proud graduate of the Medill school of journalism in Northwestern like me, is joining me now. Al, nice to see you in person, I appreciate it. The Democrats haven`t won an Electoral College victory without Barack Obama involved at the top of the ticket, dating back, what, for two decades now. So the bottom line is why isn`t it time to try something different?
AL FROM, DEMOCRATIC LEADERSHIP COUNCIL FOUNDER: Well, first of all, President Clinton won two Electoral College victories.
ALEXANDER: It`s been a while since President Clinton.
FROM: It has been a while. But the real problem -- the real issue for Democrats is the modernized. There are two keys for Democrats. One, we`ve got to have an agenda that produces results and grows the economy, and then we can deal with inequality. But, Paul -- many years ago told me one of the problems with Democrats is we get so interested in passing out the golden eggs we forget to worry about the health of the goose. A growing economy gives us the opportunity to do a lot of things to help people and to become a party of upward mobility again. The second thing we need do is make sure government works. We`re the party that believes in government. But if government doesn`t work, people blame us.
ALEXANDER: What`s the bottom line? The bottom line is what`s the harm in trying to incorporate populism? It seemed to work pretty well for Bernie Sanders this past campaign season, 43 percent of Democrats voted for Sanders in the primary. He beat Clinton in states like Michigan and Washington. Hillary Clinton couldn`t win the state of Michigan. Why is that the wrong strategy?
FROM: Because, we have -- first of all, we have to reach voters that we haven`t done a very good job of reaching. President Clinton called them the forgotten middle class. And we have to talk to them. But we have to be honest with them. We can`t just promise that we`re going to deliver all these goodies to them. We have to have a sensible program for growing the economy and for making sure that everybody has a chance to take advantage of those opportunities. And so -- the reason that -- I mean, the truth is we`ve never elected a populist president until Donald Trump. And it wasn`t exactly the kind of populism I like.
ALEXANDER: Let me ask you about Donald Trump if I can quickly, what should the Democrat strategy be vis-...-vis Trump? Should they work with Trump or should they pick up Mitch McConnell`s strategy versus Barack Obama eight years ago, which is basically to defy him at every corner?
FROM: I thought Chuck Schumer sort of laid it out the best way. They should not -- they should oppose things that Trump does that they think are wrong, but if he comes along with some programs that they think could help the country, they ought to help him.
ALEXANDER: But he may have the White House, and Republicans control both houses right now, so aren`t there places they maybe should work together and try to.
FROM: This isn`t just about politics. The next election for presidents is four years away. A lot of people can be hurt in the next four years. We have to make sure that we do what`s best for the country. Not just what we think -- today, will help us four years from now.
ALEXANDER: What should Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton`s role be over the course of these next four years?
FROM: Well, I think -- look, I think Barack Obama has an important role in trying to keep his coalition alive for the Democrats, even though -- proved very hard to replicate without him on the top of the ticket. Hillary Clinton`s one of the smartest people in America. She has a lot to say and she can give the Democratic Party some good advice.
ALEXANDER: Al From, from the Democratic Leadership Council, it`s nice to see you in person.
FROM: Good seeing you.
ALEXANDER: Thank you, I appreciate it. Still ahead, Democrats will get an early task of the challenges facing them next week, when some of Donald Trump`s appointees come up for confirmation. Stay with us. This is MTP daily.
ALEXANDER: Welcome back. Donald Trump still has a few cabinet picks to make. But some of his nominees already have hearing dates now on the calendar. Jeff Sessions is up first with a hearing that starts on January 10th. And then the 11th -- man, that day is loaded. That`s the second day that senators will meet with the attorney general nominee. It`s also when hearings for at least five other cabinet picks begin, at the very same time as all of those hearings, we could have the much promised and long delayed news conference from President-elect Trump. His team, said to be eyeing the 11th or the 12th. We`ll be right back.
ALEXANDER: Time for the lid, Senator Chuck Schumer says Democrats are prepared to totally block a Trump`s Supreme Court nominee that was Republican stance for nearly a year. But now, Senator Mitch McConnell has changed his own tune. Here`s what he said.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
MITCH MCCONNELL, UNITED STATES SENATOR: Apparently, there`s yet a new standard now, which is to not confirm a Supreme Court nominee at all. I think that`s something the American people simply will not tolerate, and we`ll be looking forward to receiving a Supreme Court nomination and moving forward on it.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
ALEXANDER: Back right now, Ben Ginsburg, Michael Beschloss, Karine Jean- Pierre, joining us now. Michael, to you quickly, with some historical perspective on this, do Democrats even have a serious chance of blocking a Trump Supreme Court nominee?
BENSCHLOSS: Hard to see how that threat is going to actually become a promise, but shows how politicized things have become for most of American history, would have been unheard of to see a situation such as this past year where, you know, that vacancy was kept that way, or even the suggestion that this would go on for four years.
ALEXANDER: Karine, one of the challenges for Democrats right now, right? When it was Merrick Garland who was up they said, hey, you`ve got to fill this ninth seat. Now Chuck Schumer comes out today and basically says we can`t support any Donald Trump`s Supreme Court nominee in effect. So all of a sudden that ninth seat, well, if it`s not in our hands, we`re not playing ball.
JEAN-PIERRE: Well, look, I`m in the camp of Democrats need to resist at every turn, especially when it comes to these far right-wing kind of policy that`s on the table now, that both Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan have been trying to push for many, many years. Now they have the opportunity. And so, yes, we should be blocking the way as much as possible.
ALEXANDER: Donald Trump`s strategy on the other hand is going to be, well, going forward.
GINSBERG: Sure. The real politics of this is that there are any numbers of Democratic senators up in 2018, from red states that supported Donald Trump. So this is not really a 52-48 count. This is much more the real politics of the situation.
ALEXANDER: Let me ask you a little bit, if I can quickly, about this news conference, for the first time in months, Donald Trump is set to hold a news conference. It`s supposed to take place either the 11th or 12th, the middle of the ends of next week, which just so happens to be overlapping with the confirmation hearings with Rex Tillerson, and among others, Jeff Sessions. These are going to be contentious hearings I think. Is there something to this? Some people are reading into this and saying this is a good way for Donald Trump to Trump the controversial coverage, as it may be, of them, and just focus the attention on himself.
JEAN-PIERRE: Oh, yeah, absolutely. I think when Donald Trump`s -- if he has this -- if he actually has this press conference, because we know he canceled the last one, if he does this, all eyes will be on Donald Trump. That`s what we`re going to be focused on because we -- the last press conference he had.
ALEXANDER: Does that really give a free pass to Rex Tillerson or these -- I mean, Ben, to you, to Rex Tillerson or Jeff Sessions here? I mean, they`re still going to face tough questioning, whether or not it`s a split screen.
GINSBERG: Sure, but this is Donald Trump rallying the troops to support them as the spotlight is focused on those cabinet appointees. And they`re all articulate people who will do actually much better than the picture the Democrats are trying to paint at them.
ALEXANDER: Let me ask you right now, there`s a liberal group right now trying to sink the treasury secretary nominee, Steve Mnuchin, right now. They`ve just put an ad out on this, and here`s what it looks like.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNINDENTIFIED MALE: Former Goldman Sachs banker, Steven Mnuchin, raised millions to elect Trump. Now Trump picked him to be America`s top economic official. Even though Mnuchin made millions after his bank foreclosed on homeowners and discriminated against Latinos. Tell Senator Flake to vote no on Mnuchin.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
ALEXANDER: Feels like a few months ago, and we`re right back in the middle of the campaign season right now. Is that an effective strategy, go after a vulnerable Republican senator?
BENSCHLOSS: Oh, I think you`ll see a lot of that. You know, just as you were saying, Democrats are going to try to resist. Fascinating thing about that commercial, you remember the last major commercial that the Trump people put out before the election, which went on about Goldman Sachs bankers and so on, little bit of similarity here. I mean, this is just getting mind-boggling.
ALEXANDER: Last word, how do you see this playing out that I guess?
JEAN-PIERRE: Well, look, I think we need to stop focusing on D.C. I think the resistance is actually going to happen outside of D.C. NAACP did an amazing job yesterday in Alabama, when -- you know, with their fight against Jeff Sessions, speaking of a hearing, and we`re going to see a lot more of that.
ALEXANDER: By the way, let me ask you, John McCain -- the Houston Chronicle asked John McCain today, if he could support Rex Tillerson`s nomination, he said, quote, sure. There`s also a realistic scenario that pigs fly.
(LAUGHTER)
ALEXANDER: Your take on McCain?
GINSBERG: Well, I think he`s letting the Trump administration know he`s out there. And Rex Tillerson is going to get confirmed, and so will I think all the other nominees unless there`s.
ALEXANDER: There`s only so much room for error on Russia and things like that, right? Only a couple votes to play with there.
GINSBERG: Yeah, true. But Rex Tillerson will go in and show a command of the world, and a command of affairs that will, I think, be very effective.
ALEXANDER: We`ll see middle of next week. Ben Ginsburg, Michael Beschloss, Karine Jean-Pierre, thanks you all for being with us today. After this break, drawing the line in Carolinas, you`ll like this. Stay tuned.
ALEXANDER: All right. In case you missed it, the map of the United States has just changed. All right, we`ll walk you through this. The line between North Carolina and South Carolina literally moved. The border battle goes back so long that to this day, both states claim to be the birthplace of President Andrew Jackson because the land surveys of that day were literally a mess. More than 20 years ago, the states decided to try to clarify the 334-mile area that`s in question here. Finally, this week at the stroke of midnight on January 1st, the border officially shifted, a little bit, and moved up about 100 feet, mainly in North Carolina`s, Gaston County, and South Carolina`s, York County. So 19 homes started the New Year in a new Carolina, some people woke up with one foot in both as it turns out. The border literally cuts right through some properties, even through the middle of some homes. At least one resident has already received tax bills from both states. And the biggest legal fireworks were over actual fireworks, which are against the law in the north, and allowed to be sold in the south, so a minimart that has a new North Carolina address had to get special permission to sell fireworks. All of it confusing, don`t worry, the iconic south of the border stop on 995 remains south of the border.
That`s all for tonight, we`ll be back tomorrow with more MTP DAILY.
THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED."
0	45	 46 von 72	Fox News Network	January 3, 2017 Tuesday	 FOX HANNITY	 10:00 PM EST		"SEAN HANNITY, FOX NEWS HOST: And happy new year. Happy 2017, and welcome to ""Hannity.""
Tonight, we have a short ""Opening Monologue."" Now, Democrats -- they continue to make the claim that the Russian government is directly tied to the 2016 election hacking, and with weeks to go before he leaves office, well, President Obama announced sanctions against Russia. And also the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security -- they released a coinciding report supposedly containing evidence that the Russian government coordinated all these cyber attacks. But that report gives very few details and a massive, big disclaimer.
Now, Democrats were also pointing a finger at the group Wikileaks, claiming that Russian hackers provided them with thousands of the e-mails from the DNC and from Hillary Clinton's campaign chairman, John Podesta. Now, these e-mails contained explosive details exposing corruption, media collusion with the Clinton campaign and downright dirty politics all the way around. 
So in light of all these new developments, well, I decided to go straight to the source over this ongoing controversy. So yesterday, I traveled to London to sit down with Wikileaks founder Julian Assange in an attempt to set the record straight. Now, he rarely does these exclusive, long-from interviews given the nature of his current situation. Now, for four-and-a- half years, he has been confined at the Ecuadorian embassy, where he's not seen the light of day in all that time.
So Assange, of course -- he founded the group Wikileaks. That was back in 2006, and in the years following, he made international headlines after releasing hundreds of thousands of classified U.S. government documents. And in 2010, he was detained in England after Swedish officials issued an arrest warrant over allegations that he may have sexually assaulted two women. That is a charge which he will respond to later in this program tonight in this interview.
Now, in 2012, he was granted asylum in the Ecuadorian embassy in the city of London. Now, he has been living there ever since in very, very confined, tiny quarters. So in this wide-ranging interview, which we will show for the entire hour tonight, Assange told me what drives him to expose government and media corruption.
Take a look.
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
HANNITY: Let me start with the American elections. And from your perspective, how big a role do you feel WikiLeaks had in the outcome of the election? You didn't think Donald Trump was going to win.
JULIAN ASSANGE, WIKILEAKS FOUNDER: I didn't think Donald Trump would win. I thought the -- you know, the establishment, for want of a better word, would see Hillary Clinton losing and then would pile in more money and more energy and the various TV networks that were on her side and make sure that she won.
I think that analysis was still correct, but it missed something fundamental, which is that the amount of investment to the Hillary Clinton campaign was in proportion to the degree that the establishment thought that she would lose. And she was aggressively projecting that she would be the inevitable winner and was above, you know, 5, 10 points in the opinion polling.
So she only got a billion-and-a-half directed into her campaign. If they thought she was going to lose, maybe she would have gotten $5 billion. We'd -- we'd see a different result.
HANNITY: It's very interesting, post-election -- and it didn't even really happen immediately, but the narrative has begun that, in fact, the U.S. government is accusing WikiLeaks of having received materials from Russia and Russia's cyber criminals with the political agenda of influencing the elections. And obviously, they're talking not just about the John Podesta e-mails...
ASSANGE: Yes.
HANNITY: ... the DNC e-mails, but in other ways. I've asked you before. I'll ask you again today. Did Russia give you this information or anybody associated with Russia?
ASSANGE: Our source is not a state party. So the answer for our interactions is no. But if we look at the most recent statement by the U.S. government, which was on the 29th of December -- OK, we had five different branches of government -- Treasury, DHS, FBI, White House -- presenting their accusations to underpin Obama's throwing out 35 Russian diplomats. What was missing from all of those statements, the word WikiLeaks. It's very strange.
Now, my interpretation is that there's either, not surprisingly, a problem they feel with the evidence as far as WikiLeaks is concerned. Well, James Clapper said, We don't know how WikiLeaks got this information, we don't know when WikiLeaks got this information.
But let's imagine that they are saying, OK, the problem here is that WikiLeaks published information. Well, what are they saying?
WikiLeaks published true information that the American public read. That information was the words of Hillary Clinton and her campaign manager, John Podesta, and other people in her campaign. And the American public read that information, true information, and said, We don't like these people, and then voted accordingly.
HANNITY: Let me...
ASSANGE: But that's -- that's not sustainable. So what they want to do instead is conflate our publication of true information with, say, hacking, or rather, alleged hacking, of U.S. vote-counting machines. And even Obama has had to admit that there has been no hacking of U.S. vote-counting machines.
HANNITY: No evidence of that. So -- but the main focus for most Americans -- they are being told by Hillary Clinton's campaign, by the president of the United States -- there are the Department of Homeland Security, the officer -- the office of the Director of National Intelligence, et cetera - - that, in fact, WikiLeaks in -- was working with the Russian government to influence the election.
Is that true in any way, shape, matter or form?
ASSANGE: No. That's absolutely false. And if you read their statements carefully, you will see they don't actually say that. They kind of mention one fact here and one fact there and nothing else.
In the most up to date information, on the 29th of December, where the FBI, DHS, White House, et cetera, made a statement, what is completely absent from all those statements is WikiLeaks. Totally absent.
So what's going on? Well, I believe two things are going on. Number one, they don't have the evidence that WikiLeaks is involved in that way. Now, why am I confident about that?
Well, because there is one person in the world -- and I think it's actually only one -- who knows exactly what is going on with our publications, and that's me.
HANNITY: Can you say to the American people unequivocally that you did not get this information about the DNC, John Podesta's e-mails -- can you tell the American people 1,000 percent you did not get it from Russia...
ASSANGE: Yes.
HANNITY: ... or anybody associated with Russia?
ASSANGE: We -- we can say and we have said repeatedly...
HANNITY: Right.
ASSANGE: ... over the last two months, that our source is not the Russian government and it is not a state party.
HANNITY: There was one report in The Daily Mail that suggested somebody that you are friendly with actually was handed the documents at American University in a wooded area by a disgruntled Democrat who felt betrayed because they -- the revelations showed that Bernie Sanders had been betrayed and they didn't like the corruption of the Clinton Foundation.
Can you confirm or deny that? Is that story true?
ASSANGE: Well -- well, that statement came from Craig Murray. He is a friend of mine...
HANNITY: Friend of yours?
ASSANGE: He's been -- been here several times. But WikiLeaks is a source protection organization. We are famous for never having exposed one of our sources over 10 years. That's why sources trust us and they come to us.
So I can't comment on other people's statements about our sources, except to say what we have said, which is that our sources are not a state party.
HANNITY: Can I ask you this? Have you ever talked to Vladimir Putin?
ASSANGE: No.
HANNITY: Have you ever talked to any of his surrogates?
ASSANGE: No.
HANNITY: Have you ever talked to Donald Trump?
ASSANGE: No.
HANNITY: Any of his surrogates?
ASSANGE: No.
HANNITY: Not one?
ASSANGE: No.
HANNITY: There was a report that you might have talked to somebody who was not associated with the campaign, Roger Stone.
ASSANGE: No, that's false. I think where this Roger Stone claim is coming from is there's a -- a radio guy on WBAI, which is a mutual friend, who was -- who wanted to come and see me to see if I would set up a radio show on WBAI, but he didn't. He did come to London, but he didn't meet with me.
HANNITY: So if the U.S. government is accusing WikiLeaks of having received these materials from Russia and you say it's false, it did not come from Russia, and the president of the United States is advancing the narrative, is the president of the United States lying to the American people?
ASSANGE: Well, he -- he's acting like a lawyer. If you look at most of his statements, he doesn't say that. He doesn't say WikiLeaks obtained its information from Russia, worked with Russia, et cetera....
HANNITY: He's saying Russia's trying to influence the U.S. elections.
ASSANGE: Yes. Yes. So he -- and you also note that he doesn't say -- from the statements that I've read, he doesn't say that Russia was trying to influence the election for Donald Trump. Obama doesn't say that.
And so you have -- you have to be very careful about the lawyerly language that is used to try and conflate different things together.
The question is, WikiLeaks publications -- OK, true information that the American people took up and they acted accordingly. Was it influential? Did it have a lot of influence?
Statistically, yes, it's -- it was the number one topic in Facebook throughout October, it was the number one topic on Twitter, political topic, also throughout October.
Did it change the outcome? Who knows? It's absolutely impossible to tell. If it did -- the accusation is that the true statements of Hillary Clinton and her campaign manager, John Podesta, and the DNC head, Debbie Wasserman Schultz -- their true statements is what changed the election.
HANNITY: What is -- how do you view yourself? Are you a -- a -- a journalist? Do you view this as reporting, that -- for example, it's interesting because at one point in the campaign, The New York Times got a hold of Donald Trump's taxes -- which, by the way, they obtained illegally -- and they published the information.
Is there any difference between -- you are not going to reveal your source, but nobody has said what you released is not true. They went forward with the story on his taxes. Is there any difference?
ASSANGE: There is -- there is a difference, which is our material is better presented, less intermediation. The public responded to it more than -- than The New York Times.
But the editor of The New York Times -- he has come out and said that he would do the same thing as WikiLeaks. If they had obtained that information, they would publish it.
Now, unfortunately, I don't believe that is true. I believe they would selectively maybe publish just a bit here and a bit there. They would not have done what we did, which is present the American public everything that we knew.
Can you just imagine that if WikiLeaks had information about Debbie Wasserman Schultz helping to rig the primary with Bernie Sanders and we withheld that information until after the election? That would be an absolutely unconscionable act for a media organization to engage in. Unfortunately, those sorts of acts do happen. But not with this organization.
HANNITY: You know, in 2015, the Chinese stole millions of personal documents, classified, information on individuals who are seeing and working for our government, et cetera. So if they don't say anything about China and they selectively choose this, is it to delegitimize Donald Trump? What's your interpretation of that?
ASSANGE: That's exactly what it's designed to do. The -- if you look at what the allegations are, they don't mention WikiLeaks on the -- for the 29th. They don't mention our publications.
Our publications had wide uptake by the American people. They're all true. But that's not the allegation that is being presented by the Obama White House. So why such a dramatic response?
Well, the reason is obvious. They're trying to delegitimize a Trump administration as it goes into the White House. They're going to try -- well, they are trying to say that President-elect Trump is not a legitimate president.
(CROSSTALK)
HANNITY: Is your information...
ASSANGE: And now you watch. They will seize on this and harp on it for the next four years. I think that's a mistake. I think that's a mistake not just in fact, that's a mistake for the U.S. Democratic Party. I think it's a stupid maneuver.
It's the same reason why they lost the election, which is instead of focusing on substance, they focused on other things which they think are short-term wins, but they're not strategic, a little comment by Trump here and there, for example, or this attempt to say that -- that how outrageous it is that the American public received true information before an election. The -- the public doesn't buy that. They want as much true information as possible.
HANNITY: If the information you had was about Donald Trump and his campaign, would you have equally released that?
ASSANGE: Yes, absolutely. It's -- it would be -- once again, just think about it from our perspective. We have a lot -- we've won a lot of media awards. We have the trust of our sources. We have the trust of our readers, having never got it wrong.
HANNITY: Well, this is an important point -- 10 years, not one evidence where you've been proven wrong.
ASSANGE: Well, not even -- not even one sustained allegation, even. We have a perfect record in relation to authenticating the material that we publish. That's a very valuable reputation to have and we try and preserve it.
So what else do we have a record for? There's no sources coming out through other journalists -- say, for example, they can still keep their anonymity. There's no sources coming out and saying, We gave WikiLeaks all this information about Donald Trump or the president to be or -- or Vladimir Putin, and you know what? They didn't publish it.
HANNITY: I know you...
ASSANGE: No one -- no one has come out and said that. If they did, that would hurt our reputation for trust for our sources.
HANNITY: I know you want to protect your sources, and you -- when you first told me on my radio show that it was not Russia, you said so reluctantly. Can I ask -- take it one step further? Can you say that the source was within the United States?
ASSANGE: I don't want to constrain whether it was someone inside the United States, in the DNC, in the service providers that provide for the DNC, or outside, et cetera. I think we have already pushed it quite a lot by...
HANNITY: More than you would like?
ASSANGE: More than we would like by saying it's not a state party. That - - that was necessary to do because there was an -- a serious attempt to distract from the content of our publications with this Russian narrative.
Now, our sources are interested in two things. They're interested in protecting their identity, but also not going through all that effort and risk to themselves only to have the publication undermined.
HANNITY: Then what do you make of the president of the United States, since Donald Trump may, in the next 24 to 48 hours...
ASSANGE: Yes.
HANNITY: ... contradict with whatever information he's teasing that he does have -- but he made a decision to expel 35 Russian diplomats in two sites, imposed 12 sanctions against the Russian government. And you know, the Russian president, Putin, responding by inviting children to a -- a Christmas party and said he will wait to deal with the new president.
What do you -- why would the president -- you're saying that Russia did not give you this information. He is very closely suggesting that, in fact, they did. And he's wrong.
So my question is, does he know he's wrong, from your perspective? He has to know.
ASSANGE: He's playing games.
HANNITY: He's playing games.
ASSANGE: He's playing games.
HANNITY: He's dishonest. Fair? Is he lying to the American people?
ASSANGE: He's acting like a lawyer instead of being honest. So he's playing -- playing games by trying to suggest that Russia, quote, ""hacked the election,"" unquote, pretending that what's going on here is Russia hacking voting machines, for which there is no evidence, saying without -- suggesting without saying that our information was part of a plot to get Donald Trump elected.
Once it -- once again, from our side, which we understand there's no evidence, but even James Clapper, and so on, coming out and saying. We don't know how WikiLeaks -- we don't know when or how WikiLeaks got this information. So it -- it's a -- it's a construction to try and erect a topic that Donald Trump is illegitimately elected.
(END VIDEOTAPE)
HANNITY: More of my exclusive sitdown interview with Wikileaks founder Julian Assange. Up next, I'll ask him about the FBI and the DHS report on election hacking.
That and more straight ahead tonight on ""Hannity.""
(NEWSBREAK)
HANNITY: And welcome back to ""Hannity."" So during my exclusive sitdown interview with Julian Assange at the Ecuadorian embassy in London, I asked him specifically about the FBI and DHS report on 2016 and the election hacking. Let's take a look.
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
HANNITY: The FBI, Department of Homeland Security -- this goes to the 29th of December this past year -- released a joint report detailing how federal investigations and investigators linked the Russian government to the hacks of the Democratic Party organization. And they gave a 13-page memo. I'm sure you've read it.
ASSANGE: I have read it in detail.
HANNITY: At this point. OK. Supposedly, they give technical details regarding tools and some of the infrastructure of the Russian civilian and military intelligence, but they don't give any proof positive.
ASSANGE: They -- they give five...
HANNITY: (INAUDIBLE)...
ASSANGE: ... five page description of some of the tools that they allege that the Russian state uses. The rest is just fairly boring security recommendations. On the top, there is a disclaimer saying nothing in...
(CROSSTALK)
ASSANGE: ... guarantee that any of this information is accurate.
HANNITY: Right.
ASSANGE: So...
HANNITY: It's a guess.
ASSANGE: ... so if you -- it's -- it's just -- you're looking at -- I used to be a computer expert. That was my -- my job. This is a bad report. And you look in the -- in the rest of the computer security community, you will see dozens of other computer security experts in the United States, absolutely not affiliated with Russia...
HANNITY: Isn't it contradicted, though, by our own director of Intelligence -- National Intelligence?
ASSANGE: James Clapper.
HANNITY: That's James Clapper.
ASSANGE: Well, there's nothing in that report that says that any information was given to us. Nothing. What they have is what they call indicators, so, like, a way to recognize if these tools -- these alleged Russian tools have been used on your system.
OK. So in response to that, some engineer at one of the U.S. electricity companies found this signature of one of their laptops. OK. So then this was analyzed by a wide range of U.S. computer security experts. I've read those reports in detail, and it's discovered that this is a commercially available tool produced by Ukraine.
So it's straight -- straight out of the bat, we either have a deliberate attempt to mislead or thoroughly incompetent work, straight out of the bat.
So it -- that story about the laptop at the power generation center, that was picked up by The Washington Post and the administration, pushed everywhere, that here's the Russians infiltrating the electricity grid, and it was completely bogus.
HANNITY: That was bogus. But there's another side of this which is, I think, pretty fascinating, and that is that Hillary Rodham Clinton had a private server at a mom and pop shop in a bathroom closet that I would argue -- maybe argue -- and other lawyers would make arguments that it was illegal for her to have. From what we understand, the Podesta e-mails were hacked through a phishing scheme where it said, Click on this, give us your information, and he did so.
ASSANGE: Well, there's a number of hacks of the DNC and Podesta based on the publicly available information. This is not something coming from our sources. We published, as part of our policy of full disclosure and not interfering with the material...
HANNITY: Right.
ASSANGE: ... we published the -- several Podesta e-mails which shows Podesta responding to a phishing e-mail. Now, how did they respond?
Podesta gave out that his password was the word ""password."" His own staff said, This e-mail that you've received, this is totally legitimate. So it's -- so this is something a 14-year-old kid -- a 14-year-old kid could have hacked...
HANNITY: Based on that.
ASSANGE: ... into Podesta that way.
In relation to computer security and Hillary Clinton's security, those secretary of State e-mails, if you read closely, FBI reports and the e- mails that we released related to Hillary Clinton, you will see Huma Abedin had access to them. A variety of technicians at this very small IT company had access to them, shipped through the post, you know, a laptop. She had over a dozen different devices keyed in to have access to them, her iPad, et cetera. She made almost no attempt to keep them secure...
HANNITY: Right.
ASSANGE: ... from states. Now, was she trying to keep them secure from the Republicans? Well, probably. But in terms of foreign states...
HANNITY: (INAUDIBLE)...
ASSANGE: ... almost no attempt.
HANNITY: The reason we have these laws, though, are for transparency, and she wanted to avoid Congressional oversight.
ASSANGE: Absolutely. Absolutely. That's absolutely my interpretation, as well. Now, WikiLeaks has been a very strong proponent of the Freedom of Information Act. This is probably, actually, if you think about it, probably against our interests as -- as a publisher. But we believe that people have the right to know true information about what their government is doing.
Now, the Freedom of Information Act has been subverted. We published Sarah Palin's e-mails. Why? Because she had -- when she was governor of Alaska, she maintained an account that was being used, intentionally or not, to evade the Alaskan Freedom of Information Act. So we published them back in 2008.
(END VIDEOTAPE)
HANNITY: And coming up, Wikileaks exposed how the mainstream media was colluding with the Clinton campaign during the 2016 election. I'll ask Julian Assange about that next.
That and more tonight on ""Hannity.""
HANNITY: And welcome back to HANNITY. So during my exclusive interview with Julian Assange we discussed how WikiLeaks exposed the rampant collusion between the mainstream media here in America and the Clinton campaign. Let's take a look.
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
HANNITY: I said in my country, Julian, journalism is dead. I said it in 2008 because I was investigating Barack Obama and his backgrounds and his associations and his career and his lack of knowledge and his radical belief system. And everybody in the media ignored a lot of it.
So my question to you is, now knowing what WikiLeaks revealed about the Podesta emails on Clinton corruption, on pay-to-play, on Bernie Sanders being cheated, all of this is revealed, not a lot of this was covered. So what does the say of the American people about media coverage in America? Dishonest?
JULIAN ASSANGE, WIKILEAKS FOUNDER: It is very dishonest. Corrupt is interesting. It depends on your definition. If you look at what we published --
HANNITY: If they are colluding with Hillary, that's not corrupt?
ASSANGE: It's an ethical corruption.
HANNITY: They're not identifying it to their audiences. They claim that they're objective journalists.
ASSANGE: It's ethically corrupt. Corruption also means I can get more, which is that you take money in exchange. So I don't think that -- --
HANNITY: Collusion.
ASSANGE: Collusion, yes.
HANNITY: Because they share her political agenda. Why else would they collude? Or they hate Donald Trump.
ASSANGE: I think that's an optimistic interpretation that they share a political agenda.
HANNITY: Explain that.
ASSANGE: It's more like, you rub my back, I'll rub yours. I will give you information. You'll come to me -- I'll invite you to my child's Christening or our next big party. You know what I mean?
HANNITY: Or a state dinner.
ASSANGE: Yes. So I think it is more, sadly, I think it's more along those lines.
HANNITY: But I look at this list of what WikiLeaks exposed --
ASSANGE: Can I just go back to this media question? What is the line now in ""New York Times,"" MSNBC? The line is that WikiLeaks changed the results of the election. OK, as the editor of WikiLeaks, we are happy to have credit for exposing the corruption and behavior that was occurring in that Clinton team and the DNC fixing things against Bernie Sanders. We are quite happy to accept that.
HANNITY: Was that your motivation? Was your motivation to influence the election? Or is your motivation, what is your motivation? Is it fidelity to truth?
ASSANGE: My motivation for 20 years, for 10 years with WikiLeaks, has been to publish true information that is otherwise unsayable. So we're not in competition, if you like.
HANNITY: You have no political agenda?
ASSANGE: That is a political agenda.
HANNITY: Expose government corruption?
ASSANGE: It is not a party political agenda. It's a philosophical agenda. We believe that the best type of government comes from a government that is scrutinized by the people when they have true information about our governments, major corporations, other power actors in society --
HANNITY: Let me ask this. As a conservative, one of the things that's shocked me about the revelations with WikiLeaks in this election cycle, it drove me crazy for years. The narrative that would be used by the Democrats about conservatives like myself is Republicans are racist, that they're sexist, that they're homophobic, that they're misogynistic, Islamophobic, xenophobic, all those lines are used. And what was fascinating and not many people wanted to pay attention to it, and I think that's because of the media collusion, is they were exposed as using racial language, being anti-Semitic, homophobic, which led to on the eve of the Democratic Convention, Debbie Wasserman Schultz being fired. That to me was the type of thing -- if you sort of open a window and things are not often the way they appear.
Is this now a new reality going forward in terms of if the media is not going to do their job, there are going to be more WikiLeaks in the future?
ASSANGE: Well, I surely hope so.
(END VIDEOTAPE)
HANNITY: And coming up, over the years Julian Assange has released classified documents generating major controversy. We'll explore that and much more right here tonight on HANNITY.
HANNITY: Welcome back to HANNITY. So in 2006 Julian Assange founded the group WikiLeaks, and in the years following he created international controversy and outrage for releasing hundreds of thousands of classified U.S. government documents. Many, including myself at the time, had criticized him for doing this, and during our sit-down interview, I asked Assange where WikiLeaks draws the line. Take a look.
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
HANNITY: I told you this before when you first came on the scene in 2010, I was concerned you were waging war against the U.S. I have a comment that I made back in November of 2010, and I said, you know, that other people might be -- this classified information, releasing classified information, my concern with classified documents could put American lives at risk. That was my concern.
So this is what, in the meantime, what you released at that time, the standard operating procedures for Delta, the U.S. Army, detention camp at Gitmo, you released a classified video of a series of attacks in Baghdad by a U.S. helicopter that killed 12 people and two journalists. You also released the Afghanistan war logs. You released the Iraqi war logs. You released diplomatic cables in November of 2010, the Guantanamo files. You released more U.S. diplomatic cables, released the Syria files leading up to -- here's my question about this, because I've come to believe that you've done two things that are extraordinarily helpful to the United States And I think journalism in a way. One is you showed us that we do not have cyber security. You acknowledge that.
And two, I think in this election in particular, you exposed a level of corruption that I for 30 years on the radio as a conservative knew existed, and I was shocked at the level of corruption, duplicity, dishonesty, manipulation. So there is a lot of good here. Where does the line -- where is the line for you? In other words, if lives are in jeopardy, is that a line? Privacy for individuals, is that a line? If you were to be handed information about a private citizen, a Hollywood actor?
ASSANGE: Let's look at the practice. As editor of WikiLeaks, I am very proud of three things. Number one, we have never got it wrong in terms of what we say. A document is what it is.
HANNITY: What you have printed, what you have revealed --
ASSANGE: There's never been -- and not even it is there any outstanding allegation. Number two, we have never revealed one of our sources ever.
HANNITY: Today you could reveal the source of the Podesta emails. That will make a lot of news.
ASSANGE: Yes, and that would be the end of WikiLeaks.
HANNITY: But you did say it's not Russia, and you don't like to say that.
ASSANGE: We have in the past occasionally on particular issues where we think that there is a distraction from the publications that is so severe that we kind of have to distance ourselves from it and prevent a vacuum basically being fueled by any old rubbish.
So number three, what are we proud of? We are proud that there is not a single instance of anyone coming into physical harm as a result of our publication.
HANNITY: Let me ask you, have you made conscious decisions as the founder and editor to withhold information because you thought the release of your information would result in somebody's death? In other words means, methods.
ASSANGE: No. Where we thought there was a significant risk.
HANNITY: You are very conscious of that?
ASSANGE: Yes.
HANNITY: That's an ethical standard for you.
ASSANGE: Yes. And so we are always transparent about it.
HANNITY: You'll say that --
ASSANGE: We simply say we are withholding this piece of information for a limited time until such time as we think there is not a significant risk that someone might face retribution. We are totally transparent about it. So unlike other media organizations, you see huge redactions with no explanation as to why that information is being redacted or being withheld. I can tell you, I know from practice having dealt with more than 110 different media organizations and partnerships, that very often information is withheld for political reasons and it is then passed off that it is being withheld in order to protect individuals. So redactions are deeply corruptive. We are fighting --
HANNITY: You are describing the ""New York Times."" You're describing ABC, NBC, CBS, ""Politico."" You are describing the mainstream media in America.
ASSANGE: And --
HANNITY: WikiLeaks has shown us.
ASSANGE: We had similar problems with ""The Guardian."" They are also fine journalists who did good work. So it's not everybody. But they were critical cases where information that we shared in a partnership agreement under the basis it would only be redacted for human rights reasons, we are protecting someone's life, it was redacted to protect oil companies working in Kazakhstan or Yulia Tymoshenko, the former leader who was accused of all sort of murders in Ukraine.
So here is the basic problem with censorship. Once again, it creates an opaque system where people can't see what were the reasons for the censorship? In the justice system, we say there must be open justice where there is to be justice. The judged while trying must themselves be tried before the public.
HANNITY: Is it fair to say --
ASSANGE: It doesn't happen when a media organization is engaged in just sweeping things under the rug.
HANNITY: Is it fair to say that WikiLeaks is more interested in government corruption that is impacting the lives of people, not superfluous scandalous lives of big stars?
ASSANGE: We don't publish that. We haven't actually been, I'm not sure we've ever been put in a position where we've had to make that determination.
HANNITY: Because that's not what we do.
ASSANGE: Most people go to TMZ, for example.
(END VIDEOTAPE)
HANNITY: And coming up, Julian Assange has not stepped outside the Ecuadoran embassy in London since 2012. Up next, I will ask him about the controversial details of his confinement and much more, straight ahead.
HANNITY: Welcome back to HANNITY. So back in 2010, Swedish authorities, they issued an arrest warrant for Julian Assange based on two separate sexual assault allegations which ultimately led to Assange seeking asylum at the Ecuadoran embassy in London. I asked Assange about these allegations and more. Take a look.
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
ASSANGE: Let's put this in context. The U.S. case started first in 2010. The situation where we are today --
HANNITY: These are two Swedish women.
ASSANGE: The women did not make the allegations. So the state made the allegations. It is agreed all the way up two the Supreme Court, that it is the state of Sweden that brought the case, not the women trying to file charges. There are no charges.
HANNITY: Why would the state do that and not -- if the women aren't making, get the U.S. case dismissed? You must be confronted by your accuser. Not the case here.
ASSANGE: No. They admit in their own filing that the woman says that she was railroaded by the police and others in the court's material. The police made up the accusation. And I've already been previously cleared by the chief prosecutor. There are no charges, and twice this year the U.N. reviewing the whole situation has said that I am illegally detained and I should be immediately released and compensated.
Now, as far as the U.S. is concerned, it's a very important topic. The case in the U.S. continues. The Department of Justice continues the whole case.
HANNITY: Even though they said they concluded they would not --
ASSANGE: They didn't. They didn't. This is the sneaky behavior of this administration. As we were complaining, look, the Obama administration is maintain this massive case against us, is refusing to release any document about it to us or any other journalists, erecting a giant dam for all the material involved and kept saying the reason that no journalist can have this is because we are bringing pending prosecution. This is the end of national security journalism. This is the end of investigative journalism if journalists can't say, hey, we heard a rumor. We heard a rumor there was a journalist killed in a drone strike. You know anything about that? And maybe a source says, yes, actually I heard about that. And then you go, can you prove it?
HANNITY: But America, if you go back to Woodward and Bernstein and you go back to Watergate, they had a source. It was called Deep Throat, big source. It wasn't revealed until the person died.
ASSANGE: Under the Obama administration, Deep Throat, Woodward and Bernstein would have been prosecuted.
I have been detained illegally without charge for six years, in prison under house arrest, four and a half years in this embassy, without sunlight, lots of spies everywhere, et cetera. It is tough. It's tough, but that is the mission that I set myself on. I am willing to accept that.
I understand the kind of game that's being played with big, powerful actors. They try to take revenge. It is a different thing for my family. I have young children under 10 years old. They didn't sign up for that, OK? I'm the type of father that they have. But they didn't sign up for that, and that's not something I like. And I think that is a fundamentally unjust outcome for my children. It's not a good situation for other people to have as well. But that would be my one concern.
I know what I'm doing. I am prepared to weigh the consequences in the conflict in dealing with powerful groups and individuals. But my family is innocent in that equation. They didn't sign up for that fight.
(END VIDEOTAPE)
HANNITY: And coming up, we will have more HANNITY, and your help is needed right after this break.
HANNITY: All right, time for our ""Question of the Day."" So now that you've heard from Julian Assange, who do you believe? Do you believe Julian or do you believe President Obama and Hillary Clinton? We want to hear from you. Go to Facebook.com/SeanHannity, @SeanHannity on Twitter, let us know what you think.
And in 17 days, the long Obama nightmare is over. We'll see you back here tomorrow night. Thanks for being with us."
0	46	 47 von 72	Fox News Network	January 3, 2017 Tuesday	 THE KELLY FILE	 9:00 PM EST		"MEGYN KELLY, FOX NEWS HOST: Breaking tonight with just over two weeks until President-elect Donald Trump is sworn in and before he takes a single official act of president, Democrats are mobilizing to block delay and obstruct his agenda.
Welcome to THE KELLY FILE, everyone, I am Megyn Kelly. Today, we witnessed the start of a new era in American government. The 115th Congress convening for the first time. And after Mr. Trump's inauguration, 17 days from today, Republicans will control the White House and Congress for the first time since 2007. For their part, Democrats are trying to ensure that this new unified government gets off to a slow start.
As that party Senate leadership reportedly now planning on holding up the confirmation process for at least eight, eight, top major cabinet post. Their goal, to drag out a process that normally takes weeks into months, a move that the Washington Post calls unprecedented.
New elected Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer taking to the Senate board today, offering this warning to the President-elect. Watch. 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY), MINORITY LEADER: There are those who suggest that our baseline posture should be to work with the President-elect and having passed his whole agenda. But Mr. President, it is not our job to be a rubber stamp. It's our job to do what is best for the American people, the President-elect Rand is a change agent. He ran against the establishments to both parties.
Since the election, he seems to have forgotten that. Too many of his cabinet picks support the same hard right doctrinaire positions that many in the Republican Party have held for years. Policies that the American people have repeatedly rejected the attempt to adopt their timeworn policies, which benefit the elites, the special interests, corporate America, not the working man and woman. His presidency will not succeed.
KELLY: In moments we will be joined by former House Speaker Newt Gingrich who was a close advisor to the President-elect.
But first we go to FOX News politics editor Chris Stirewalt on these coordinated efforts against the new Trump administration.
Chris, good to see you.
So, I guess it's a war room, they are going to sit. They're going to have little combat helmets on.
(LAUGHTER)
These cabinet nominees. So who do you think is most vulnerable and are you shocked that they don't want Trump's guys?
CHRIS STIREWALT, FOX NEWS POLITICS EDITOR: Well, they've got to do something. They got kicked in the shorts. They had their worst year in a lot of ways since 1988. They were not at all prepared for it. You can't have a war room if you don't have an army. They ain't got no army. And you've got to do something. Schumer is using a little Trumpism here. He's making maximalist threats. He is saber rattling. In hopes I assume that he can get something better down the road. Get some leverage out of this deal. The two week spots. The two most vulnerable.
I would say probably the two weak spots. One is Scott Pruitt. The Attorney General of Oklahoma who Trump has tacked to be the head of the EPA. Climate change stuff is going to be a big deal there. They will hone in on him, they'll go hard right there. The other one, depending on what Trump does with the intelligence about the rushing hacking could be Rex Tillerson. His pick for secretary of state. That's a big target. That's a real big target. If they go after him, and they get cross ways about the Russians, that is a potential big liability. But we don't know how Trump is going to a play the intelligence stuff yet.
KELLY: Uh-hm. But you heard Chuck Schumer, I am not there. We are not there to be a rubber stamp. You know, we've got to put these nominees to the test and, you know, sort of trying to shore up. I don't know, is he the general? You say you cannot like -- is there an army? Is he the general -- like, who is their leader?
STIREWALT: Well, and that is exactly the issue. And Barack Obama says, he is not leaving. He says he's got to continue to fulfill his role instead of doing what his predecessors have done which is go and get -- quietly.
(LAUGHTER)
KELLY: That's the American way.
STIREWALT: That's the American way. Is that he seems to want to hang out and he's going to continue to live in Washington and he is going to be here and says he wants to take a leadership role as Democrats. They are divided. They don't know which way to go. There are a lot of things that Chuck Schumer and Donald Trump who are friend agree on, like borrowing a trillion dollars and spending on infrastructure. They both want to do that. There are things that Democrats want to work with Trump on. But they're afraid that if they are seen as two accommodation, they will lose their party's base and they will become even more hopelessly divided.
KELLY: Did you get a haircut?
STIREWALT: I did.
KELLY: You look good.
STIREWALT: I had all that time over Christmas. I had to do something.
KELLY: You look like a dapper. Actually dapper tonight, Stirewalt.
(LAUGHTER)
Good to see you.
STIREWALT: Happy New Year, counselor.
KELLY: To you too.
Well, in addition to reports of obstructionism in the Senate, we are also learning tonight that the Democratic National Committee is building a, quote, ""war room"" filled with former staffers from Hillary Clinton's failed presidential campaign to challenge the new administration every step of the way.
Joining me now, Newt Gingrich, a former Republican Speaker of the House and a close advisor to President-elect Donald Trump and the author of the book ""Treason."" Great to see you, Mr. Speaker. So, you know --
NEWT GINGRICH (R), FORMER SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE: You say that differently every time I am on. It's amazing how many very variations you have.
KELLY: I want to read it. All right. So, this is, I mean, what about the lecture we got when Barack Obama took office that we are supposed to root for our president and work together and the shock and awe that was expressed when Mitch McConnell was saying, you know, their top goal was to defeat his agenda? And you know, what are you talking about? It's America. It's a different message now.
GINGRICH: Well, look, I think the Democrats are in a state of shock. I am old enough that I couldn't help but think of Charlie Hallock, who used to be the Republican House Minority Leader when John F. Kennedy was president, when Lyndon Johnson was president. And -- although he's from Indiana. So, the accent was different but it's, ""no, no, no, stop, stop, stop"" nothing shrinks your party faster than learning the word no.
All of your allies know that they all come and give you money at the fundraiser, they all applaud but the rest of the country will look at you like you are nuts. You know, you do a couple of things that I mentioned I think either you or Greg that are really amazing. If you think about it, about Stirewalt rather, if you think about it, taking on Tillerson, who had the largest manufacturing company, ExxonMobil, deals in 80 countries or so, stunningly successful, ego scout et cetera. Why would you want to pick a fight with him?
I mean, I understand picking a fight with the Attorney General of Oklahoma. You almost have to for their Sierra Club. But I think the Democrats are just floundering right now. They know that they have to appear to their base to be saying, no. But that is going to drive moderate and middle- class America away from them at a very rapid pace.
KELLY: Now, you reportedly when you were speaker, you know, like this kind of thing too. And there was a 2000 book, 2012 book by Draper, ""Do Not Ask What Good We Do."" That suggested that, years ago, you sat down and said, this is, let me see, this is a strategy to take back the House in 2010, so you weren't a speaker and the Senate in 2012 when you said, at the end of a meal, you will remember this day, you will remember this day as the seeds of 2012 were sown. And that you, like, you know, most Republicans wanted obstructionism when there was a Democrat in the White House.
GINGRICH: Well, what I said was, if Barack Obama governed based on his inaugural address and on his speech at Grant Park and on his speech the Saturday before the election, that he was so moderate, he was so much in the center of the country. If he governed like that, he would be Eisenhower. He would split the Democratic Party, he would be re-elected. He would grow the Democratic Party. And we couldn't do anything about it. But if he went to the Left, Pelosi and Reed and did exactly what they did do, he would set up a moment for real polarization.
And that's what they decided to do. And that set the stage for 2010 and beyond. And my advice to Trump is to learn a really deep lesson for that. I mean, here is a chance to reach out to Democrats. And as Stirewalt mentioned, it's very real is the notion of a bill for infrastructure. He should be able to have at least one-third of the Democrats to decide that they want an infrastructure build.
KELLY: But what about this cabinet? Like President-elect Donald Trump definitely has some agenda items that are, you know, in the middle ideologically that should be appealing to some of these Democrats. But the cabinet picks are clearly conservative which is his right, he won.
GINGRICH: Right.
KELLY: But they seem to be really digging in. And do you think that somebody like, some has also said, you know, Mnuchin, they're going to dig in on because he was behind his group, was behind a lot of these foreclosures on this mortgage backed securities and do you think Scott Pruitt who we just discussed for EPA? I mean they are really going after Pruitt. Do you think they will stop these guys from getting through and how many capitals that that spend when the Supreme Court justice fights come up?
GINGRICH: Look, well, I think first of all, the Democrats are going to be under enormous pressure. There's a spring session of the court. We already know that Trump is going to name one of the people on his list that he released months and months ago. They are all solid conservatives but they're all widely respected jurists. I mean, nobody is suggested any of these aren't valid as Supreme Court nominees.
KELLY: Uh-hm.
GINGRICH: So they'll bring that out very early and at the clock will start running and of the country is going to watch the Democrats twist themselves into pretzels. But let's take your deeper point. And I do think some of these guys are going to have to sort of earn their approval by doing really well in hearings and going to see senators and doing all of the things you do in this process.
But remember, Trump is not, he's not a normal Republican versus Democrat, Right versus Left guy. The example I tweeted about today is, you know, jobs in Michigan's by the Ford Motor company which is now going to invest $700 million in Michigan instead of Mexico and the president of Ford said, look, we are doing this because we believe in the regulatory tax reform that Trump is talking about. Now what I twitted today is so how many Democrats in Michigan care enough about Michigan jobs? To vote for the reforms that Ford says are essential to keep those jobs in Michigan?
KELLY: Uh-hm.
GINGRICH: And that's going to oppose -- this is going to be very different than anybody expects. This will not be a normal right versus left presidency. This will be a very innovative, very pragmatic presidency.
KELLY: Happy New Year, Mr. Speaker. Good to see you.
GINGRICH: Happy New Year!
KELLY: Well, as the former speaker just mentioned, there is no reaction tonight to President-elect Trump calling out General Motors. Trump's critics are now, and now GM itself are hitting back. Anthony Scaramucci and Julie Roginsky are here next to debate.
And as Chicago's former top cops suggests the Black Lives Matter movement has led to an uptake in crime, will take a look at some suggestions in federal intervention in cities like Chicago under a Trump administration. What's going to happen to all of these DOJ investigations?
Plus, after sound issues resulted in a disastrous -- I don't think that's too strong -- I think that's probably correct. New Year's Eve performance in Times Square, could Mariah Carey face legal drama for how she handled it?
(LAUGHTER)
A revised Kelly's court appears tonight. We'll take up that debate coming ahead.
KELLY: Breaking tonight, President-elect Donald Trump employing a unique tactic during his transition. A penchant for calling out big business practices he objects too over Twitter. And in some cases, getting results. But tonight, one of those companies is pushing back with General Motors correcting President-elect's claim of automobiles build overseas.
Anthony Scaramucci and Julie Roginsky are here whether Mr. Trump continued twitter, critics may be bad for business. But first we go, we go to Peter Doocy live at Trump Tower with the latest on today's fight with the auto giant.
Peter, what is the story?
PETER DOOCY, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Megyn, he did it with Carrier. He did it with Boeing, he did it with Lockheed Martin. So now the President- elect is trying his luck with GM, now using Twitter to put pressure on the carmaker to try to fall in line with his policies. He did tweet this this morning. ""General Motors is sending Mexican mode model of Chevy Cruze to U.S. car dealers tax free across border making USA or pay big border tax."" Mr. Trump has previously threaten a 35 percent tax for American companies he thinks are trying to make money here with products produced cheaply elsewhere, but it's rare for him to use this much detail and GM quickly recognize they may have a problem on their hands.
So, they put out a defensive statement that explains quote, ""All Chevrolet Cruze sedans sold in U.S. are built in GM's assembly plant in Lordstown, Ohio. GM builds the Chevrolet Cruze hatchback for global markets in Mexico, with a small number sold in the U.S.""
Well, Ford has been there GM is right now before. Candidate Trump used to go after Ford hard on the trail for planning to move some production down to Mexico. But now that there are critics as President-elect, the company has an announcement. They are pulling the plug on a factory project in Mexico. And investing $700 million in the Michigan plant, something happening impart because of something the President-elect said.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
MARK FIELDS, PRESIDENT AND CEO, FORD MOTOR COMPANY: When we look at some of the tax and regulatory reforms that he's been talking about, that gives us a lot of confidence and this is a vote of confidence that he can deliver on those things.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
DOOCY: And he's not just tweeting, the President-elect is ready to take questions. A long-awaited general news conference was announced tonight for January 11th. That is one week from tomorrow -- Megyn.
KELLY: Peter Doocy, thank you.
Joining me now with more, executive committee member of the Presidential Transition Team, Anthony Scaramucci and FOX News contributor and Democratic analyst Julie Roginsky.
Good to see you both.
JULIE ROGINSKY, DEMOCRATIC ANALYST: Great to see you.
ANTHONY SCARAMUCCI, EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE MEMBER, PRESIDENTIAL TRANSITION TEAM: Thanks.
KELLY: So, I mean, President-elect Trump defenders will say, so, he is using the power of his office to try to obtain results for the American people.
ROGINSKY: Well, the right that he is using the power of his office, I remember back in the day, Anthony, you might remember this too. Republicans didn't like to pick winners and losers. They like to have the market place --
SCARAMUCCI: What are you talking about Solyndra?
ROGINSKY: I'm talking about -- exactly, you to complain about Solyndra quite a bit. And I am happy to see that you are following by picking winners and losers on twitter. Look, if he's able to accomplish this -- if he is actually able to accomplish this true regulatory reform and broad- based reform, that's one thing. If he's picking companies, naming them by name, where he is saying if you do X, I will do Y.
For Carrier for example, where Carrier got a few million dollars to save a couple of hundred jobs, 800 jobs that they will now use the money to automate most of those jobs anyway but that's something the President-elect doesn't want to talk about, that's different, that's picking winners and losers and that's something that I think people -- Republicans at least, who love the free market, don't necessarily support and have it until --
SCARAMUCCI: So, Julie has tough adversaries, what she's missing about the President-elect, he's become the blue-collar advocate in chief among so many other things that he's doing right now.
KELLY: But how is that different from being the green advocate in chief that Barack Obama was?
SCARAMUCCI: It's very different. Because in the case of General Motors or Ford, they are existing companies. They have an existing capital allocations structure. And they're making a decision whether to produce here in the United States or produce off the shores of the United States. And Solyndra was the -- where the President-elect or President Obama was making a decision about the environment. In this case, it's the focused that's on American workers, Megyn, and rising middle class wages and working class wages and so a very, very big difference --
ROGINSKY: So the priority is we have an issue with -- it's not the philosophy, it's the priority.
SCARAMUCCI: It's actually not just the priority. What the Democrats also understand which we both understand is that we've got to get the middle- class rising wages, we've got to get the working class which is turning into the working poor in the United States into the aspirational zone like my --
KELLY: What about that? What about the argument Julie that all we need to do is pick a couple of these? Right? And like threaten, and that, you know, the belief by some that the other companies who are thinking about moving their plants to Mexico will then be shamed. They know he is going to come after them, they don't want that. And they say, you know what? Is it really worth it?
ROGINSKY: You know, I am old enough to remember 2008, Barack Obama was riding high when he was coming into office. Everybody thought, you know, it was a Kumbaya moment. And then reality hits. And what ends up happening is, these companies are going along now, because he's not yet president, they're not sure what he is going to do. The minute his number starts to tank a little bit inevitably you know they will because nothing is going to last forever. They are going to do what's best for their bottom-line. And at the end of the day, what's going to end up happening is that they're going to make business decisions based on partially on the regulatory environment, partially the tax environment but also partially what's best for their --
(CROSSTALK)
KELLY: I mean, he's really put a 35 percent tariff on --
SCARAMUCCI: He's not going to do that.
KELLY: You're not because he has said that.
SCARAMUCCI: Well, I think that is a bargaining chip on the table to get the understanding among, you know, whether it's Mexico, other countries, China --
KELLY: Because you know if he puts a 35 percent tax on those products that are crossing the key borders in the United States --
SCARAMUCCI: I understand that --
KELLY: That the American people are going to have to pay.
SCARAMUCCI: But Megyn, what the American have to know since 1945, we made State Department and Treasury, a concerted effort to uneven the trade deals. Goods and services flows freely into the United States. Our good and services --
KELLY: That is true.
SCARAMUCCI: -- into other countries.
KELLY: That is a fact.
SCARAMUCCI: Okay, Megyn. We did that to create economic interdependence. It was a bipartisan thing. Both Democrats and Republicans. All Mr. Trump is now saying his timeout, let's have the dilatory side effect of hurting working class --
KELLY: Dilatory. Look at you. Delete with ory at the end.
SCARAMUCCI: ACT's for the young people out there. SATs for the old people.
ROGINSKY: What are you looking at me for?
(LAUGHTER)
What's your point looking at me for old people?
SCARAMUCCI: No, no, no, no --
(LAUGHTER)
(CROSSTALK)
It's nothing to do with you. Sorry brother.
KELLY: But your point is, he is like enough is enough. Let's even the playing field?
SCARAMUCCI: And let's even the playing field because let me tell you something, the last best hope for globalism is Donald J. Trump, I'm going to tell you why, you created a burgeoning market for the middle class and the working class families, where 23.6 percent of the GDP of the world and we will see an increase --
KELLY: It's similar with what he's doing with China. I mean, this is not --
(CROSSTALK)
KELLY: Okay. Great to see you.
SCARAMUCCI: Julie is worried, she is worried.
ROGINSKY: I am not worried.
KELLY: Okay. Coming up. A not-so-subtle message from the President-elect to President Obama's former chief of staff after Mr. Trump suggests that Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel may need the Feds to help tackle historic levels of violence in his city.
And wait until you hear Rahm's response. We'll debate what it all might mean for the future of U.S. policing.
Plus, the debate over Gitmo detainees still continues. Eight years after President Obama promised to empty the prison as the very first thing he wanted to do upon becoming president. We will show you how the President- elect just inserted himself into this debate earlier today when former Congressman Pete Hoekstra and Matt Bennett joins us right after this break.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENT-ELECT: This morning I watched President Obama talking about Gitmo, right? Guantanamo Bay, which by the way, which by the way, we are keeping open. Which we are keeping open.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
KELLY: Breaking tonight, the Obama administration and President-elect Donald Trump at odds over the controversial detention center at Guantanamo Bay. For more than eight years, the President has vowed to close this facility. And just with 17 days remaining in office, the White House is suggesting that Barack Obama's Gitmo legacy could still be evolving.
For more on that, we go to chief intelligence correspondent Catherine Herridge, live in Washington. Catherine?
CATHERINE HERRIDGE, FOX NEWS CHIEF INTELLIGENCE CORRESPONDENT: Megyn though we're still more than two weeks away from taking office today, Mr. Trump inserted himself into the controversial detention of alleged terrorist of Guantanamo Bay, writing in a tweet, ""There should be no further releases from Gitmo. These are extremely dangerous people and should not be allowed back onto the battlefield.""
FOX News has visited the detention camps more than any other TV network and today, only 49 detainees remain. And the Obama administration still plans to transfer as many as 19 men to other countries before the inauguration. The White House spokesman said today their policy remains on track and Mr. Trump can do what he wants when he is in charge.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
JOSH EARNEST, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: He'll have an opportunity to implement the policy for -- that he believes is most effective when he takes office on January 20th.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
HERRIDGE: The Obama administration's decision to transfer this detainee Ibrahim al Qosi remains controversial and underscores the risk. After leaving the Gitmo camp in 2012, al Qosi became the public faith of al Qaeda's most dangerous affiliate that was behind the attempted bombing of a U.S. passenger jet. The five 9/11 suspects including the self-described architect of the attack Khalid Sheikh Mohammed are still held at Gitmo and already in the military legal system. So they are not eligible for transfer.
But the case has essentially stalled out over them in CIA detention and interrogation that critics call torture. One of his first access president in 2009 with the signing of an executive order to close the Gitmo camps within the year. That effort is failed with President Obama and his team, now blaming Congress for throwing up roadblocks -- Megyn.
KELLY: Catherine, thanks.
HERRIDGE: You're welcome.
KELLY: Joining me now with more, Pete Hoekstra, former Michigan congressman and advisor to President-elect Trump's Transition Team and Matt Bennett, former deputy assistant to President Clinton. Great to see you both.
MATT BENNETT, CO-FOUNDER, THIRD WAY: Great to be here.
KELLY: Pete, let me ask you, because, you know, Barack Obama has made clear he wants to get rid of these last detainees. Or at least 19 of them. So, the White House was asked today, are you going to take into account President-elect Trump's request that he not transfer it anymore, that a new administration is coming in and that, you know, Donald Trump had an issue on the campaign trail saying, they're not going to be any more transfers, we're not going to close it. And the White House said, we will not be taking that into account. Your thoughts?
PETE HOEKSTRA, FORMER HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN: I think that is exactly right. President Obama is going to try to fulfill his first promise -- one of his first promises that he made when he came into office. He's going to be unable to do it and at the end result is, with these 19 people that he most likely will transfer by January 20th, many of these are going to be the exact same people that Donald Trump is going to have to go back in his administration that they're going to have to capture. We are in a hot war.
The threat to radical Jihadism today is his greatest any time since 9/11. ISIS is taking credit for about 1100 suicide attacks in 2016. You've got the attacks going on in Turkey, in Germany, in France, and those types of things. You've got failed states in Syria, Iraq and Libya. The threat is real. We are in a worse situation than we were in 2009 when this president came into office. We should not be letting this people free.
KELLY: But what about it, Matt, should President Obama give any thought to the desires of the incoming commander-in-chief in these 19 detainees?
BENNETT: No, he should not. We have one president and President Obama will be president until noon on January 20th and he has to act like it.
If we somehow decided that between November and January we were going to have two presidents, where that the president, the incoming president was going to do nothing for three months that would be a signal to the world that they can do whatever they like for those three months and nothing would happen.
Obama has to act like the President. And Gitmo has been a super rating sore in the war on terror from the beginning. Do not take my word for it. That's a call on policies. That's what John McCain says.
KELLY: But we've just had this election in which Donald Trump made this an issue.
BENNETT: Right.
KELLY: I mean, he said we are keeping it open, we are going to load it up with some bad dudes. Believe me, we're going to load it up. So, this was at play, an open issue in the 2016 presidential election and the American public sided with Donald Trump.
BENNETT: Well, they voted for Donald Trump to be president. You can't say they cited with him on every single issue that he talked about. In fact, on many if you look at...
(CROSSTALK)
KELLY: That, I'm taking this from Barack Obama who when he was running whenever he got it -- when he got elected and tried to put anything into play, he'd say I disclosed this. I disclosed this (Inaudible) I made this an issue.
So, I don't know, you tell me, Congressman Hoekstra, it turnabout it's fair play and he should be held to that same account that the will of the American people has apparently shifted now if you follow his logic?
HOEKSTRA: Well, the turnabout should be fair play number one because Donald Trump did win on these issues. But turned around should be fair play because bottom line is, the policies of President Obama in fighting radical Jihadism have failed. This president gave the radical Jihadist just about everything and from a perception standpoint they could've asked for, he engaged with the Muslim brotherhood. He recognizes it.
(CROSSTALK)
KELLY: Well, he gave Obama -- Osama Bin Laden a bullet between the eyes.
HOEKSTRA: He gave Osama Bin Laden a bullet but it came to long-term he embraced the Muslim brotherhood, he supported their efforts to change the governments in Egypt and Libya and foster the kind of chaos that we see today. The policy, Trump's policy in his words should be listened to because they set aside a new direction...
KELLY: OK.
HOEKSTRA: ... that enable us to hopefully defeat radical Jihadist.
KELLY: Well, they are not going to be.
HOEKSTRA: They're not -- you're right. They're not going to be.
KELLY: So, we'll see.
HOEKSTRA: Yes.
KELLY: We'll see what happens. It's always a hassle to transfer these guys. And nobody really wants them. And then we get like a promise from Yemen that they are going to watch him really closely. Great to see you, guys.
HOEKSTRA: Good to be here, Megyn. Thanks.
KELLY: Also, tonight after a year that saw nearly 800 homicides in Chicago. Mr. Trump hinting we could see big changes when it comes to policing in America. As the president-elect suggest that Mayor Rahm Emanuel in Chicago might need federal help now to tackle the historic violence in his city, and wait till you hear what Rambo, as Hannity calls him, has to say about that. He calls him Rambo dead fisherman. He's not a fan is the point.
We're going to debate all of this with Kevin Jackson and Eric Guster just ahead.
Plus, could there be legal, yes, I say legal fallout to Mariah Carey's now infamous New Year's Eve performance? Oh, do we have a Kelly's court for you. Coming up.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
MARIAH CAREY, SINGER: That was -- bring us on, yes. You just don't get any better.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
KELLY: Developing tonight, controversy after President-elect Donald Trump opens up the New Year with a tweet about one of the most violent years ever in the city of Chicago. And that, sadly, is saying something.
Without mentioning him by name, Mr. Trump suggesting that if the Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel can't get things under control, he should ask a the feds to step in. Some are taking that as a sign that U.S. policing could undergo some major changes in 2017. Normally it's a local matter not a federal matter. Amid some feelings that the timing could not be better on possible changes there.
Fox News contributor Kevin Jackson and attorney Eric Guster will join us in a moment, but first we go to correspondent Matt Finn with the latest live in Chicago. Matt?
MATT FINN, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Megyn, Donald Trump firing off another one for one of his signature direct attack tweets. This time at Chicago Mayor, Rahm Emanuel. Trump tweeting out, quote, ""Chicago murder rate is record setting, 4331 shooting victims with 762 murders in 2016. If mayor can't do it, he must ask for federal help.""
Mayor Emanuel spokesperson responding saying in part, ""As the president- elect knows from his conversation with the mayor, we agree the federal government has a strong role to play in public safety.""
Now to give you some perspective on Chicago's shocking crime stats, in 2016, 762 people were murdered. An average of two people killed per day. Imagine that in your hometown. Last year, there are over 4,000 people shot, and year to date, four people already murdered, just three days in.
Chicago's crime problem very complex. Illegal guns, cheap heroine, gang turf wars. All topped off with the police force that's been essentially stripped of the tools of stop and frisk. Chicago top cops say it's time for prosecutors and judges to get tough.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: If you do pick up a gun and you use it, you will be held accountable. And right now, we don't do that.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
FINN: Now notable Chicago activists Fr. Michael Pfleger has helped lead the effort to stop violence where it happens most in African-American communities where his parish is located. Pfleger says he's reached out to Trump so far but has not heard back. Pfleger agrees Chicago needs federal help.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
MICHAEL PFLEGER, CHICAGO ACTIVIST: When they reach out and really want to really see some substantive changes and making a difference, or they just want to continue to Band-Aid?
(END VIDEO CLIP)
FINN: Now, Megyn, we should point out CPD is under investigation by the Department of Justice for allege misconduct and racism and to be fair to Mayor Rahm Emanuel who received so much criticism, he recently found the funding to add 1,000 more officers to the streets. Megyn?
KELLY: Matt, thank you. Well, the former top cop in Chicago says he knows what's going on in his city and in what he calls a disturbing case of irony. He says the deaths we're seeing are the byproduct of a group that claims to be trying to stop the violence, Black Lives Matter. Listen.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
GARRY MCCARTHY, FORMER CHICAGO POLICE SUPERINTENDENT: So, what's happening is, and this is ironic, that a movement with a goal of saving black lives at this point is getting black lives taken. Because 80 percent of our murder victims here in Chicago are male blacks. Less than half of 1 percent of all the shootings in the city involved police officers shooting civilians.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
KELLY: Joining me now, Kevin Jackson, Fox News contributor and executive director of the BlackSphere.net, and Eric Guster, an attorney and political commentator.
Great to see you. So, I mean, the numbers are just dreadful in Chicago, Kevin, dreadful, and these the murder surge that we've seen this year is the largest spike in 60 years in Chicago. So, it's bad and when you didn't think it could get worse, it just did. So, what now happens? I mean, should we be sending the feds in to cities like Chicago? And what -- what does that do to local policing?
KEVIN JACKSON, THE BLACK SPHERE EXECUTIVE EDITOR: Well, frost of all, it's no surprise, I mean, we had an administration that's been so bad against law enforcement it's easy to see what the outcome was going to be. And the unfortunate part, Megyn, is it's obviously affecting the black community worse.
As far as the feds go, I think what Trump...
(CROSSTALK)
KELLY: Just to pick up on that, just to clarify, is that the suggestion that the police officers are holding back so that they don't get accused of excessive policing, you know, excessive force?
(CROSSTALK)
JACKSON: Absolutely.
KELLY: And that's leading to...
JACKSON: Yes, absolutely.
KELLY: ... this spike.
JACKSON: Or, it's -- absolutely. And not only that, they don't want to go in there to get in trouble because what's going to happen is as the top cop in Chicago said, they can end up getting in trouble and you know...
(CROSSTALK)
KELLY: The Ferguson effect.
JACKSON: ... being accused of -- yes, being accused of over policing.
(CROSSTALK)
KELLY: That's what (Inaudible) call.
JACKSON: Yes, what Trump did -- yes, what Trump did was amazing because what he did in that one tweet, was what he did for immigration, what he did for you know, to saying we need to vet Muslims. As he brought a problem that has been sick leaked.
This isn't sneaking up on us, Megyn, we've known about this for years. Rahm Emanuel, week after week, the Chicago Tribune reports these, the deaths of these people, every single weekend. And it's multiple people shot, multiple people killed. So, it's not a surprise. And in fact, I suggest that Trump tweets Baltimore, and he tweet D.C., and he tweet Detroit, as well. Because per capita...
(CROSSTALK)
KELLY: But where is this take us. I mean, you tell me, Eric, where this takes us. What is he going to do, send in the National Guard? I mean, I doubt Mayor Emanuel wants that. Is he -- is he going to send in a bunch of federal money to Chicago because I don't know if the American taxpayers want that?
ERIC GUSTER, ATTORNEY & POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: Of course, Trump is the master of tweeting something that has no meaning behind it. But 80 percent of the arrests in Chicago are down. It's down 80 percent. And that is a major statistics that we have to pay attention to.
When the stop -- when the cops stop working because they claim that they have a low morale so they are not doing their jobs, that's the problem, Megyn. And we need to hold them accountable.
(CROSSTALK)
KELLY: Well, isn't that the former superintendent police is suggesting, that's what he seems to be blaming that on Black Lives Matter.
GUSTER: No, the former police is suing some George Wallace standing in school of house of George talking points. That's what he's doing. Because if these police officers are afraid of being held accountable, that's a problem on them. Because Black Lives Matter and other social justice groups just want them to be held accountable to make sure they do the right thing.
KELLY: But the accountability that we've seen in the Obama administration, Kevin, which is includes some 25 investigations by the DOJ, they are right now enforcing 19 agreements with law enforcement agencies. The Washington Post did a study on this and said these kind of overhauls that come from these DOJ investigations have unintended consequences.
One took 11 years and eight police chiefs, one took $300 million of taxpayer's money, so what is a likely had the President Trump continues that? And should he, given the cost that we see?
JACKSON: Well, first of all, I want to address something that Eric said, which is around you know, what's happening in the black community. You're talking about people calling cops pigs in a blanket. Do you remember when I...
(CROSSTALK)
GUSTER: That is one -- hey, stop telling a lie.
JACKSON: There was a girl.
KELLY: No, it's not a lie, it did happen.
(CROSSTALK)
JACKSON: Hey, Eric.
GUSTER: But the more it keeps playing...
JACKSON: Eric, Eric, I didn't interrupt you. I didn't interrupt you.
KELLY: Hold on. Hold on.
JACKSON: I didn't interrupt you.
GUSTER: Go ahead, Kevin.
JACKSON: I let you talk.
KELLY: Go ahead, Kevin.
GUSTER: Go ahead.
JACKSON: So, the point is, there were girl -- there was a girl in that audience that said they didn't even want police in black neighborhoods. So, what do you want? Either you want cop presence, but here's the bigger issue. The bigger issue is, we shouldn't be killing each other. We should be a civil society and that isn't going around killing people to the tune of 762 people.
(CROSSTALK)
KELLY: getting to the root cause of that is a much bigger effort.
JACKSON: That is exactly right.
KELLY: I'll give you the last word, Eric. I'll give you the last word.
GUSTER: It takes a community of policing, it takes communities working with police officers. And cops just need to do their jobs.
JACKSON: Now we ask.
GUSTER: Black Lives Matter and other groups just want them to do their job and be fair, just we're all asking. Be fair and civil to all people regardless of race and economic conditions.
KELLY: All right, guys, we got to leave it there. Good to see you.
GUSTER: Thank you.
KELLY: Coming up, after her New Year's Eve performance, and she lashed out at the executives at ABC. Did you hear about this, and Dick Clark Productions, right? Were you -- I mean, I don't know if you're watching. I was watching Kimberly and Eric.
But the question is whether Mariah Carey could be facing a defamation lawsuit? Attorney Mark Eighlarsh and Andell Brown will be here to discuss next.
MARIAH CAREY, SINGER: Well, Happy New Year. We can't hear but I'll just go through the motions, OK? We didn't have a check for this song so we'll just say it went number one and that's what it is, OK?
(END VIDEO CLIP)
KELLY: OMG, OMG, secondhand embarrassment. Developing tonight, new questions about the legal implications - legal implications I'd say of Maria Carey's reaction to her New Year's Eve performance. The singer's bad performance on New Year's Eve becoming a viral sensation. But the drama did not stop when the show ended.
And that's we'll be doing by attorneys Mark Eighlarsh, Andell Brown and the potential legal fallout. But first, we check in with Trace Gallagher who volunteered to be on the story all day long. Go ahead, T.G.
TRACE GALLAGHER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: I did, Megyn. Mariah Carey's team says she was singing to track, meaning parts of her performance are lip- synch, and other parts she sings live. Either way, her manager says, Carey needs to be able to hear the music and she couldn't because her earpiece did not work.
But production sources told Entertainment Weekly that part of the problem was that Carey skipped rehearsal. Carey's people denied that saying she had stand-in dancer but she did the sound check and complain the audio was coming in choppy.
Carey's manager says the production company assured the singer that everything would work once they went live. It didn't. Watch.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
(MARIA CAREY SINGING)
CAREY: It just don't get any better.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
GALLAGHER: Yes, a little up, Mariah Carey walked off stage stage. And shortly after tweeted, quote, ""blank happens. Have a happy and healthy New Year everybody. Here's to making more headlines in 2017.""
But when the disastrous performance also aired three hours later on the West Coast feed, Carey's team accused Dick Clark Productions of sabotaging the performance to improve ratings.
The production company responded, quote, ""To suggest that Dick Clark Productions would ever intentionally compromise the success of any artist is defamatory outrageous and frankly, absurd.""
But today, Mariah Carey told Entertainment Weekly that Dick Clark was an incredible person and quote, ""I'm of the opinion that Dick Clark would not have let an artist go through that and he would have been as mortified as I was in real time.""
By the way, Jenny McCarthy who co-hosted the show said it's the background dancers were in sync, which they were and could hear the music blaring from the speakers, why couldn't Mariah Carey? Megyn?
KELLY: She raises a good point. I hadn't consider that myself. Good to see you, Trace.
Joining us now is Mark Eighlarsh, a criminal defense attorney, former prosecutor, and Andell Brown, a defense attorney on this important matter. Thank you for being here counselors.
Mark Eighlarsh, let's start with whether the Dick Clark Production company can sue Mariah Carey for what it is alleging where her representatives defamatory statements about them setting her up to fail.
MARK EIGHLARSH, CRIMINAL DEFENSE ATTORNEY: Absolutely not. They would have to prove actual malice because we are dealing with public figures. It's a very high burden. That means they have to prove that at the time she made the statement, she knew they were false or a reckless disregard of the truth.
Megyn, as we sit here today, she still believes that they sabotaged her. They have no case.
KELLY: Well, she doesn't though end up. Because it wasn't Mariah who said that, it was her rep who apparently said something off the record to somebody. And was -- it may or may not have been that they set her up intentionally but you know, that they didn't set her up to succeed in any events. Your thoughts?
ANDELL BROWN, DEFENSE ATTORNEY: Setting her up to fail is very strong words. Could they bring lawsuit? Absolutely. Will they bring a lawsuit? I don't think so. I don't think it made sense for them to do that. That would be kicking an artist when they're down. This production company...
(CROSSTALK)
KELLY: But they are using a strong words, defamatory strong.
BROWN: Very strong.
KELLY: I mean, I was surprised to see that the Dick Clark statement.
BROWN: Setting someone up to fail is very strong as well, I think we all saw Mariah Carey's performance breakdown and keep steadily breaking on down in front of our eyes on New Year's Eve.
Her team they are doing damage control, and they are trying to pass the buck. Nobody is buying it. Dick Clark and his company's reputation is intact and that's the problem they are going to have. So, yes...
(CROSSTALK)
KELLY: So, here is the question. Can she sue them? Can she sue them, Mark Eighlarsh for saying you did set me up to fail, you cause a public embarrassment, but then there is a question of why the backup singers could hear the music and Mariah could not?
EIGHLARSH: Yes, listen. Anyone can sue anyone for anything, we've learned that. My analysis is the same if we flipped it and we make her the plaintiff. She is a public figure, they are public figures.
KELLY: But she wouldn't be suing for defamation.
EIGHLARSH: It's not going to go anywhere.
KELLY: They publicly humiliated her.
EIGHLARSH Wait, you know what, Megyn, hold on. Hold on. There is something wrong with my earpiece. I can't hear, perhaps -- perhaps, Megyn, we should let the audience finish this analysis.
KELLY: I love you bring the props. You know, I will say this, Andell, I have anchored in Times Square on New Year's Eve with hammer, you know, wee hours in the hours, and it's really loud and I too have had that choppy audio. I -- I can relate to her.
BROWN: These things happens, she's a great artist, she has a great career. She just had a bad night and I'm sure she did her all to have that performance back.
KELLY: I think it would have been more damaging...
(CROSSTALK)
EIGHLARSH: There is no damaging.
KELLY: ... if she had been caught lip-synching, but she wasn't. She was trying to sing it live. It was clearly, you know, just parts were on the track. But the reason there were long bouts of silence is because she couldn't hear. But she I think it's worse when they get caught lip- synching. That's what I thought happened not...
(CROSSTALK)
EIGHLARSH: I agree, Megyn, here is the problem. There is no damages here on either side. They're all going to watch the show next year.
KELLY: That's true.
EIGHLARSH: And she's going to have completely a very successful career.
KELLY: But they shouldn't use the scary legal word because you wind up in Kelly's court.
EIGHLARSH: Agree.
KELLY: Bye. We'll be right back, don't go away.
KELLY: Finally tonight, a personal and professional note from me to you. After more than a dozen years at Fox News, I have decided to pursue a new challenge.
This is a tough decision for me because I love this show. Our staff, my crew, my colleagues here at Fox. And you. All of you. Those who write me the lovely hand written notes asking about my kids, and even those who very rarely complain on Twitter about our coverage after a show or a presidential debate.
Now, I don't actually know most of you so perhaps it's not true love, but it's the kind of feelings that that makes one feel connected to another human being. And that after all is why I believe we're here. Human connection.
The truth is, I need more of that in my life. And in particular, when it comes to my children, who are seven, five, and three. So I will be leaving Fox News at the week's end and starting a new adventure.
Joining the journalists at NBC News, who I deeply admire. I'll be anchoring a daytime show there along with the Sunday night newsmagazine, and you'll see me there in the big nights, too, for politics and such.
I am very grateful to NBC for this opportunity and I am deeply thankful to Fox News for the wonderful 12 years I have had here. I have grown up here. And been given every chance a young reporter could ever ask for.
The Murdoch family has been kind and good to me at every turn and my colleagues are like a second family to me. So, I will miss them and this show and you. And I hope our human connection continues. I'll be at over a different line. Thank you for watching with love."
0	47	 48 von 72	Fox News Network	January 3, 2017	 THE KELLY FILE	 9:00 PM EST		"SANDRA SMITH, FOX NEWS HOST: Breaking tonight, Vladimir Putin responding to Obama administration efforts to punish his country for meddling in the U.S. election but not the way you might think. The Russian leader mocking the President's actions as irresponsible diplomacy and issuing forward thinking well wishes to President-elect Donald Trump.
Welcome to THE KELLY FILE. I'm Sandra Smith in for Megyn Kelly tonight. One day after President Obama orders sanctions and the expulsion of 35 Russian Intel operatives from the United States, President Vladimir Putin downplays the punitive steps issuing a statement earlier today reading in part, quote, ""Although we have the right to retaliate, we will not resort to irresponsible kitchen diplomacy but will plan our further steps to restore Russian-U.S. relations based on the policies of the Trump administration. We will not create any problems for U.S. diplomats. We will not expel anyone.""
Charles Krauthammer observing earlier this evening that the Russian strong man isn't keeping his feelings about our current president a secret.

CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER, SYNDICATED COLUMNIST: Putin is showing his complete contempt for Obama, the way he kind of laughs it off. It's a smart move on the part of the Russians. You put no pressure on Trump so you give him the option to drop the sanctions. But this is a complete distraction. These sanctions are meaningless.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
SMITH: And just a moment, we will have reaction from Governor Mike Huckabee on how the next administration should handle this.
But first, we go to Peter Doocy from Florida with more on President-elect Trump's reaction to today's message out of Moscow.
PETER DOOCY, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Sandra, the President-elect wants people to get on with their lives and stop talking about hackers trying to interfere with the election. But one of his top priorities in the first week of the New Year is to great briefed by high ranking intelligence officials about the evidence they have that makes them so sure it was Russia and not somebody else trying to impact the November result.
Mr. Trump agreed to hear these intelligence officials out just a day after dismissing Intel about Russia insisting instead that he thinks in the age of computers, nobody knows what's going on. And just weeks after he said that people pushing a story line about Russian hackers actually trying to throw the election in his favor were just embarrassed about Hillary Clinton's loss, and trying to explain that away.
Transition officials said this morning on a conference call that the President-elect has no plans to privately reach out to Mr. Putin about the Obama administration's punishment until after he gets this Intel briefing next week. But he has publicly reached out to the Russian leader giving him a hat tip for pledging not to retaliate against the U.S. for punishing them until he takes the temperature of the next president's attitude toward him tweeting, quote, ""Great move on delay by V. Putin. I always knew he was very smart.""
Mr. Trump said earlier this month he doesn't need intelligence briefings daily because he says they often contain the same thing back to back but he said he gets them when he needs them based on guidance from his staff. So it sounds like someone on his staff may have told him the next president he needs to be briefed about election interference. And we've been there are going to be a lot more details about who will be briefing Mr. Trump either over the weekend or the first part of next week -- Sandra.
SMITH: All right. Peter Doocy, thank you. Today's reaction from President-elect Trump and President Putin suggests there's no shortage of affection between the two men but their friendly back and forth comes at the same time some of Mr. Trump's own advisers are recommending a much more cynical approach in dealing with Russia.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
JOHN BOLTON, FORMER AMBASSADOR TO THE UNITED NATIONS: This has all of the earmarks of a ploy. I mean the way this was set up, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov is reported publicly to propose Putin that Russia expels 35 American diplomats. So, they report the recommendation on the foreign minister and then Vladimir Putin says no, no, we won't do that. What a sweetheart. This could be entirely intended for the effect that they want to create, which is Vladimir Putin is a man you can do business with.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
SMITH: Joining me now, Governor Mike Huckabee, former presidential candidate and FOX News contributor. Good to see you, sir.
MIKE HUCKABEE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Thank you very much. Happy New Year, Sandra.
SMITH: All right. Well, you just heard it from Ambassador Bolton's mouth. Could Putin's response to our president be a ploy?
HUCKABEE: Well, in that lot of ways, I think what he's doing, he's ignoring Obama. He's doing something that really does the one thing no leader wants to have happen and that is to be taken lightly, to be ignored, to be treated contemptuously and that is what Putin is doing to Obama. And by saving his praise for Trump, I think he's sort of saying, you know, there's a new sheriff coming to town, we'll deal with him.
This guy Obama is irrelevant. Now, I think that's a strategic move on Putin's part. And let's be real clear, Putin is no friend of the United States, he's not looking after our best interest. But Donald Trump is not looking after Russia's best interest. These are both smart shrewd guys who are sizing each other up in the ring and I think it's going to be a fascinating times but I do believe Sandra they bring to the table something that Putin did not have for Obama and that is, they have respect for each other. I don't think Putin has any respect for Obama.
SMITH: Wow! Well, I mean, Ambassador Bolton, he's actually suggesting that the sanctions that Obama put on Russia should be tougher and that really stands in stark contrast to what we're hearing from many of your Republican colleagues. Do you agree with him, that he's saying if what is alleged is true about this hacking that the sanctions should be tougher, do you agree?
HUCKABEE: Sure. I think it's fine. Go ahead and put some tough sanctions on. But let me just ask this question. Does anybody really believe that the United States isn't attempting to hack the Russians, the Iranians, the Chinese, the North Koreans. And if we're not, we're stupid. Of course we're trying to do that. We haven't been caught. And if we do get caught, well, I'm sure we're going to see some, you know, outrage among those nations. The one thing I think that is being missed here is that every nation is trying to hack other nations.
It's part of cyber security. But what really happened was not something that changed the outcome of the election. What happened was that a very dumb Democrat gave his password away to the hackers, whoever they were and Hillary Clinton destroyed government documents and kept a whole lot of state secrets on a private server in her bathroom which was unsecured. That really ought to be the focus of a lot of people's attention and unfortunately --
SMITH: But let me go back to your initial point there, Governor. Because you're saying, you've made that point all along, every conversation that we've had.
HUCKABEE: Yes.
SMITH: Is that this didn't have an impact on the election. Is that important? Because Ambassador Bolton makes the point that the fact that the Russian efforts were incompetent or insufficient shouldn't make us feel better. He is saying, it's not even important to make the point whether or not there's evidence that this had an impact or any effect on U.S. elections.
HUCKABEE: I think we ought to be, you know, doing what we can to say, look, that's unacceptable, we're not going to tolerate it even while we're attempting to do it to you. So yes, I get all of that. I mean, that's part of the postering, that's part of the whole diplomatic move that we have to take. But maybe this would be a good time for us to explore the holes in our cyber security defenses and maybe the great focus, instead of putting some sanction on Russia, although I don't have any problem with that, maybe the resources that we are expending ought to be to plug the holes in our cyber security vulnerabilities.
And I don't hear that being discussed. I don't hear the outrage by Senator McCain and Graham about how dare these people get by because we were weak in our defenses and had big holes in it. Now in the case of Podestas, that wasn't a big hole, it wasn't cyber security. My gosh, the man gave them his password. He was spoofed and he took the bait. And that's what happened with all of those WikiLeaks. If it was the Russians, even though Assange says, it wasn't the Russians. They said, it came from a different source. I don't personally know one way or the other.
SMITH: Are you confident that the incoming president, President-elect Trump is prepared to deal with this cyber threat that you've just referenced? I mean, you dig through the research and I mean, there are black markets of hackers out there that they demand large sums of money. They're very good at what they do. And they're all over the place. This is a continued threat that we face. Do you think he's prepared to fight that?
HUCKABEE: Well, I do. I think he's putting some people in his cabinet and on his national security team that will be focused on it. Will he personally go in and create a fire wall? No. I doubt that he's that tech savvy. But I think he's putting people in place who recognize the importance of it. And quite frankly, one of the things that I would love to see our government do, instead of putting some of these really smart young, brilliant kids in prison and ruining their lives, maybe tap into what they know that we don't know about how to get into these security systems. I mean that would be a pretty fair deal to find out how did you guys get into the Defense Department computer any way and find out where the vulnerabilities are. That's what I would like to see President Trump do.
SMITH: Yes. It's amazing. And lastly Governor, before we let you go. The idea of the President-elect, soon to be President Trump tweeting about this exchange with Putin, are you okay with that? I mean, this latest, great move on delay by V. Putin, I always knew he was very smart. Are you all right with that?
HUCKABEE: You know, here's why I am okay with it. Because it's Donald Trump's way of bypassing a media that will never accurately filter reflect or even portray what he has said. And Donald can do more in 120 characters than ""The New York Times"" can do with 600 pages in its Sunday paper. So yes, I think it's kind of a brilliant stroke to be honest with you.
SMITH: All right. And he says he intends to keep doing it. So, it will be interesting. Governor Huckabee, thanks for being here tonight.
HUCKABEE: You bet, Sandra. Thank you.
SMITH: Happy New Year to you!
Advisers to the President-elect aren't the only one to suggest Putin is engaging in a ploy. An article today in the Daily Beast raises more questions about the Russian President's intentions with a headline that reads, quote, ""Putin outfoxes Obama, lies in wait for Trump.""
I'm joined now by Katrina Pierson, senior adviser to President-elect Trump's transition team. And Kevin Chavous is a former DC Councilman and executive director of American Federation for Children.
Katrina, I'll start with you first on this piece. Moscow laughs off the Obama administration's sanctions and expulsions as feeble last gestures as promises to respond in kind. Quite an article. I mean, is Putin laying a trap for Trump?
KATRINA PIERSON, SENIOR ADVISOR, TRUMP TRANSITION TEAM: Well, look, of course the Russians are mocking President Obama. I mean, he has 21 days left as president and all of the sudden it's time to punish the Russians? Look, it's worth pointing out that the only reason Vladimir Putin has even risen to this level of power today is because of the foreign policy impotence of this administration over the last eight years. We didn't see nearly this outrage when the Russians were involved in the Ukraine or Crimea or even Syria. But suddenly now that e-mails have been leaked, it's a problem.
SMITH: All right. Kevin, address the timing. Because the timing is what everybody likes to talk about in the wake of all of this. If they knew this for months and Chairman McCall says, he was telling Obama do something about this months ago. Why are they acting now? It seems that's a difficult answer.
KEVIN CHAVOUS, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, AMERICAN FEDERATION FOR CHILDREN: Yes, that's a great question. You know, I would agree that on one square you could say this may be too little too late in terms of the Obama administration. But Sandra, I want to go back to something you said with Governor Huckabee. To me it's not the impact of the hack, it's the fact of the hack. The fact of the matter is that when Russia decided to engage in espionage and Intel (ph) community with our country, interfere with our elections, it had a big impact that people want to talk about.
But the mere fact that they're doing this is something we need to talk about. Look, America is really uneasy with the coziness that Donald Trump has with Putin. And one thing we need to look at is not just fighting among ourselves about this, but making sure we engage in some of the things that the Governor talked about in terms of going after Russia ourselves.
SMITH: To be sure, Kevin, he made these comments about Vladimir Putin on the campaign trail and was then elected president. So, the American people weren't too uncomfortable with that relationship. I want to throw to this. Because I think it's important to remind everybody. When President Obama - - newly elected President Obama was promising outgoing Russian President Medvedev about more flexibility, this was back in 2012, you'll remember it when you see it. Watch this.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This is my last election. After my election I have more flexibility. (INAUDIBLE)
(END VIDEO CLIP)
SMITH: And to remember, President Obama was leaning in and said there, this is my last election. After my election I have more flexibility.
Katrina, look back, reflect to that moment in 2012 to today.
PIERSON: Well, that's to my very first point. I mean, look at what this administration has done globally. That's why no one is taking this seriously. But to your earlier question about, is this a trap, is Vladimir Putin somehow playing Donald Trump in some weird way. And the answer to that is absolutely not. It is in the best interest for the Russians that Vladimir Putin come to the table with a neutral slate with a President Trump and work out some of the problems that we have globally, into the best interest of both nations.
Because Vladimir Putin has to appear extremely powerful to his people and he knows two things about Donald Trump. Number one, he knows that leading from behind is not in the Trump DNA. And number two, there will be no such thing as an imaginary red line in the sand. So I suspect that these two powerful men will come together and hopefully do very good things for the country.
SMITH: All right. Kevin, and the same question to you. Has Obama been outfoxed by Putin?
CHAVOUS: Well, I don't know about that. I will say this. For the past six years it's clear that Russia is not our friend and I think that President-elect should not praise Vladimir Putin. I think what he should do is take the approach of Ronald Reagan. Like when we said Gorbachev tear down that wall. We need to make sure we're clear and direct and tough with Russia. They're not a friend of ours and we need also to make sure that we destroy this myth about us being partners in the future. They're not in our best interest
SMITH: All right. Thanks to both of you for being here tonight. Good to see you.
CHAVOUS: Thank you.
SMITH: Tonight, British Prime Minister Teresa May blasting John Kerry for his Israel's speech in a move that ties one of America's strongest partners tighter than ever to the incoming Trump administration.
Tony Perkins is here on why he believes this administration was so wrong and why the U.S. Israeli bond is so important to our country's future.
Plus, the iconic New Year's Eve celebrations in Times Square will have more security than ever after truck attack in Nice and Berlin.
Jonathan Gilliam who was in charge of the FBI's New Year's Eve security in Times Square in 2010 is here to explain what you can do to stay safe.
And there's a battle brewing in Washington over ObamaCare. And now the President himself is getting involved on Capitol Hill. We'll show you how he is trying to blunt GOP efforts to repeal and replace.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENT-ELECT: We will repeal the disaster known as ObamaCare, and create new healthcare, all sorts of reforms that work for you and your family.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
SMITH: Breaking tonight, Secretary of State John Kerry facing major backlash for his Wednesday speech. This time from the British Prime Minister. The UK's Theresa May shared harsh words for Kerry last night through a spokesperson. Demonstrating support for Israeli, some are now calling stronger than America's. May reportedly believes, ""We do not believe that it is appropriate to attack the composition of the democratically elected government of an ally. In particular the people of Israel deserve to live free from the threat of terrorism with which they have had to cope for too long.""
Joining me now is Family Research Council President Tony Perkins. Good to see you tonight, sir.
TONY PERKINS, PRESIDENT, FAMILY RESEARCH COUNCIL: Good evening, Sandra. How are you?
SMITH: First off, just explain to us why is our relationship with Israel so important?
PERKINS: Well, it's important to us as a nation, it's important to us as evangelicals in this country. Obviously we just celebrated the birth of Jesus Christ who grew up there outside of Jerusalem, in Bethlehem. Just a drive away from there. But from the standpoint of Americans, it's important that we stand -- I think we have a moral obligation to stand with this tiny little country. It's kind of like an island of freedom and democracy in a sea of despotism and despair. And increasingly, genocide is becoming a problem in that region of the world because of the failed foreign policy of John Kerry and Barack Obama. So we have an obligation, geopolitical obligation, they're the only real strong ally. We've got others in the area we're working, Jordan is good, Egypt is coming along, but none are like Israel.
SMITH: So, what kind of damage was done by abstaining from that vote last Friday and furthermore, the speech that we just heard from the Secretary of State John Kerry.
PERKINS: Well, I mean, this is John Kerry and Barack Obama putting the icing on their half-baked failed cake of foreign policy that has just been a disaster in the Middle East in the last eight years. Look, there's no question. This is a setback. The Trump administration coming in is going to have to move quickly to work to get the U.N. to resend this. It doesn't have a lot of teeth but it does stigmatize Israel.
SMITH: So, what does that look like though Tony? I mean, what kind of confidence do you have that that's going to take place and what does the relationship look like under the new administration?
PERKINS: I think -- well I think we've already seen it's very strong, even in the tweeting that has gone back and forth between the prime minister and Donald Trump. Look, I think they will move quickly. I think they'll put the squeeze on the U.N. The U.N. has to reverse this. And I think the American people need to understand, when they're talking about these settlements, these are not tents put up in the backyards of Palestinians. These are thriving communities.
I've been there many times, to places like -- where you are university, a medical center, you have an industrial complex where Palestinians are actually -- they are working alongside Arabs and Jews, and they have a high standard of living. The people there actually working out the peace process, it's working. If the politicians in the U.N. will stay out. Are there problems? Yes. But for the U.N. to do what it did and for John Kerry to make the statements on his way out the door is a major setback I believe to the peace process.
SMITH: But yet, you're still hearing from the Obama administration that Obama's government is the greatest friend to Israel, says, Secretary of State John Kerry. You clearly don't see it that way.
PERKINS: Well, I would just say this using a biblical analogy from the biblical -- is that there is no fruit to suggest that that is the case.
SMITH: Wow! All right. Tony Perkins, we'll leave it there. Thanks for being here tonight.
PERKINS: All right, Sandra. Have a good evening.
SMITH: Others today are questioning whether Trump and Prime Minister Netanyahu are becoming too close. Conservative Pat Buchanan today writing, ""Having America publicly reassert herself as Israel's best friend with no daylight between us could have us ending up as Israel's only friend and Israel as our only friend in the Middle East. Bibi's Israel first policy must one day collide with America First.""
Joining me now to debate this, executive director of the Emergency Committee for Israel and Weekly Standard contributor Noah Pollak and nationally syndicated radio talk show host and FOX News contributor Richard Fowler is here.
Noah, let's start with you first. Is the relationship getting too cozy as some are saying?
NOAH POLLAK, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, EMERGENCY COMMITTEE FOR ISRAEL: Well, I mean, so far the relationship has just been some tweets. But Buchanan has long been hostile to Israel. It's pretty well known. He has a long track record of that. And it's just a silly idea that having alliances and having relationships with other countries is like marriage or dating or something where you have to have monogamy. You don't have to have monogamy. You're supposed to actually have lots of alliances. And Israel is one of the countries that the United States has an alliance with.
And in fact, having close alliances with special relationships with other countries actually is good for the United States and it's good for our prestige and power in the world because it shows other countries that it's good to be a friend of America and you'll get good things when you're our friend. And the big problem of course with the way that Obama has done things is he's followed this sort Buchananite model of hostility to Israel and it's got us absolutely nowhere.
We had one diplomatic crisis after another that was just total concoctions of the Obama administration. They made America look foolish in the world. They undermined our power and our prestige and our relationships with the other countries. Because when you treat your friends poorly, people don't want to be your friend.
SMITH: And you referenced the tweets that have been going back and forth. Richard, I want to get you in here. Buchanan referencing one of Donald Trump's most recent tweets on Israel, saying, quote, ""Stay strong Israel, January 20 is fast approaching."" He says that he's going to be rewarding the Jewish community, he's going to stand behind Israel. Are there -- I mean, there are skeptics out there about these relationship just getting too close. What do you say?
RICHARD FOWLER, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, here's my point. I think the idea to describe the Obama/Israel relationship as hostile is far from the truth. This past September, President Obama and the state -- John Kerry State Department worked to pass a $38 billion aid bill to the country of Israel. That is $3.8 billion a year over ten years. I'm sorry. But I've been all across this country. And if you asked folks in Flint, Michigan or -- County, Alabama, what they would do with $3.8 billion if they were able to get that package for their county, they would tell you they would do a lot of things.
So, Israel is a friend to the United States, a $38 billion friend. And so, for us to say that the relationship is hostile is far from the truth. But I think Pat Buchanan is right. We cannot sit here and support Israel when they make bad decisions. The job of a good friend is to tell another good friend when they're making a bad decision. And even Jews right here in America, 44 percent of Jews here in the United States, American Jews do not even believe in settlements. They think settlements will compromise Israel's security moving forward. So, I got to tell you, I think the far right is out of touch with the Jewish community.
SMITH: All right. Noah, going back to Buchanan's piece talking about party divide, he says this is going to make the Republican Party become the pro-Israel party. Democrats will look divided and conflicted.
POLLAK: Yes. I mean, look, the Republican Party is already the pro-Israel party and it has been for quite some time and it's actually on basic foreign policy questions this is an area where there's a real stark contrast between the left and the right. The right wants strong American support for in alliances with liberal democracies that share our same enemies and share the future in the world and the left doesn't really support our allies as strongly. And that's really frankly to the shame of the left. That is something that I'm on the right and that is something that I'm very proud of.
SMITH: And Richard, let's bring this full circle. Go ahead.
FOWLER: Just one second, Sandra. I mean, $38 billion in support, I mean, come on. That's the biggest aid package in American history.
(CROSSTALK)
POLLAK: Most of that money is required to be spend in the U.S. defense industry.
FOWLER: Yes. Exactly. That -- you are -- you're exactly correct.
(CROSSTALK)
SMITH: All right. Let's bring -- hold on. Richard, I'm going to get you back in here but I want to go back to how we started this because it's actually the way Buchanan ended its peace and he says, Bibi is Israel's first policy must one day collide with America's first policy. What is the future here, Richard?
FOWLER: Well, the future is this. And I think Pat Buchanan is correct. Israel has to realize that we have to maintain other alliances in the Middle East. And when we favor Israel over other countries that we have alliance with Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Egypt, we create a powder keg and we continue to create this divide and conquer strategy which we have proven has not worked.
SMITH: All right.
FOWLER: Don't get me wrong. And I think the Palestinians are absolutely correct. They're wrong in a lot of things but --
SMITH: All right. I got to leave it there. I got to leave it there. But --
POLLAK: Obama's alliance --
SMITH: I just want to get this in here because this was breaking tonight.
FOWLER: They're not aligned with Iran. Let's stop, Noah. Just don't mix things up.
SMITH: Lawmakers in both chambers are planning to introduce resolutions formerly disapproving this recent U.N. vote condemning Israel's settlements. So, this story continues. Thanks to both of you for being here tonight.
FOWLER: Good to see you, Sandra.
POLLAK: Thanks.
SMITH: All right. Coming up, teachers unions are lashing out at the President-elect's pick for education secretary but she has one very influential supporter. We'll tell you who in a moments when David Wohl and Cathy Areu will be here to discuss the choice of Betty DeBois (ph).
Plus, ten years ago today, one of America's and the world's greatest foes was executed. So, what can we learn from Saddam Hussein's first interrogator.
The former CIA analyst who question the dictator after his capture in Iraq is here.

GEORGE W. BUSH (R), 43D PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: He was found near a farmhouse outside the city of Tikrit in a swift raid conducted without casualties. And now the former dictator of Iraq will face the justice he denied to millions.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
SMITH: Developing tonight, growing debate over President-elect Trump's pick of Betsy Devos to serve as the new Education Secretary. That choice drawing the ire of the country's teachers unions namely the American Federation of Teachers had Randi Weingarten. Watch.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE SPEAKER: There is a consensus in this country that she doesn't follow. She doesn't want public schools and she's fought against them in Michigan and the charter schools in Michigan and the public schools in Michigan are doing pretty poorly.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
SMITH: But one influential conservative making the case for Devos saying - - says ,""the opposition from those like Weingarten proves why she's such an inspired choice. Former Reagan Education Secretary Bill Bennett writing an op-ed, quote, ""By nominating a champion of school choice and local control for Secretary of Education, Trump sent the teacher's unions into panic."" David Wool is a Trump supporter and attorney, Cathy Areu is a member of the Teacher's Union and the founding publisher of Catalina Magazine. Good to see both of you tonight. So Cathy, are the teacher's union is in a panic right now?
CATHY AREU, MEMBER OF THE TEACHER'S UNION, FOUNDER OF CATALINA MAGAZINE: I wouldn't say a panic, I think - but I think more angry, they're angry. This is one of the worst choices ever.
SMITH: Why?
AREU: Well, what she's done to Michigan's school system is horrific. She's put so much money into the charter schools and taken away from the public schools, which is every teacher's biggest fear. We're all trained to be public school teachers and we know the rules, we all know how to be public school teachers. The charter schools are unregulated, you don't know what's going on and they rank so poorly. So giving more money to poorly functioning schools is taking away from public education.
SMITH: All right. Let me -- let me give David a chance to respond to that because POLITICO has the latest piece on those Michigan schools and the experiments do get poor grades it reports. She spent two decades pushing school choice there as we know and you're pointing out. But despite that the state's overall academic progress has failed to keep up pace with other states. David your response?
DAVID WOOL, TRUMP SUPPORTER AND ATTORNEY: Well, I mean, in many states these charter schools do wonders, you know. Of course, the unions are against them. The charter schools, the private schools take money out of the union's pockets and take power away from them. I mean, they're - I can -
SMITH: OK, so why is she going to be good David?
WOOL: Pardon? Because she believes in school choice. She believes in kids that are suffering from attending overcrowded classrooms, underfunded schools, allowing them to get into private schools, heavily focused on one to one academic treatment, one to one education and I can tell you --
AREU: Not true.
WOOL: -- from 25 years representing young kids in juvenile hall, juvenile court, I've seen the difference between the ones who fail out of public schools and the ones who get funneled into small classrooms and private schools and end up succeeding. The success is extraordinary, the difference is compelling, and that's why she's going to be a great Secretary of Education.
AREU: Absolutely not. If our country's education system ends up looking anything like Michigan or Detroit's education system, thanks to what she and her family have done and the money that they've put into this charter schools-
SMITH: All right, but Cathy, you know that a lot of the criticism that is been out there as Bill Bennett points out in a speech, that she's been smeared by the unions and by the left for being a devout Christian, and for wanting to give children the right to attend private schools that teach religion. They've attacked her for using personal resources that fight conservative, for conservative education reform. You know, the right says she's been unfairly criticized through this process.
AREU: Well, maybe the right doesn't understand education fully. I mean, if everyone should spend a year maybe being a teacher in a classroom and you would understand what happens and what goes on. And the charter schools, actually the The New York Times came out with an article about a year ago explaining that charter schools are not doing any better than failing public schools, quite the contrary. Charter schools are ranked the lowest. And in many Michigan the charter schools are actually at the - at the bottom of the schools.
(CROSSTALK)
WOOL: I'd love to see the details of that study. Because that hasn't been my experience. And I'll tell you something, the idea that kids would have the option of possibly going to Christian schools if they're Christians, Jewish schools if they're Jewish or Muslim schools if they're Muslims. What's wrong with that? I like the idea that the choice is a primary issue.
(CROSSTALK)
SMITH: All right, we want to move on to Obamacare, guys, stay right there. Let's transition. Yet another fight lawmakers are gearing up for on Capitol Hill as we know is Obamacare. Fox news is confirming that on Wednesday President Obama will huddle with congressional democrats to try and save his signature piece of legislation from republican efforts to kill it. Cathy what does that look like?
AREU: Well, I think that shows that Obama is going to do whatever it takes to make sure his legacy does not go down without some defense. And he's going to do what it takes to convince the senate and the senate and the house democrats to rally behind him and make sure that the repeal and replace doesn't take place.
SMITH: And David, I mean, there's a -- there's even disagreement within republicans about what they're going to do when they repeal, what they're going to do to replace. Where are we at?
WOOL: Yeah. Well, Cathy -- I agree with Cathy in respect that this is about Mr. Obama trying to protect his legacy and not doing what's in the best interest of the American people. The premiums have skyrocketed through the roof. The exchanges have fallen apart. The whole economic model of Obamacare is collapsing and, yes, Mr. Trump does believe in two aspects: allowing children or young adults who are 26 years old, up to 26 to keep their coverage if they're living with their parents. And also the pre-existing conditions.
(CROSSTALK)
SMITH: OK. Cathy, I see you shaking your head. Are you, are you --
WOOL: He agrees with that. Those are the two fundamental good parts of Obamacare that will be left intact.
SMITH: Are you making your case Cathy that Obama care is working as it is?
WOOL: But I mean, IRS is taking over your tax returns. When the IRS deducts the penalties for not signing up for Obamacare from your tax returns, that's going too far. Look for an executive order that may -- take that completely off the table and then Obamacare will become unenforceable. Mr. Trump will replace it with something like a health care exchanges that will actually work.
AREU: We don't even know what he's going to replace it with. And then there are some republican senators like Collins who have said that they're not going to support a bill that doesn't replace. You have to have a replacement and he hasn't even spoken of such a thing. He doesn't even know what to do. And its --
SMITH: Cathy, but I was just asking you the question, do you think Obamacare is working?
AREU: Absolutely. 20 million people are insured. 20 million people are insured. So what are you going to do? Take it away? What is going to happen to 20 million people that are insured by it right now.
WOOL: The exchanges have collapsed, the premiums have gone so high that people can't afford them anymore. The carriers are dropping the coverage. It doesn't work. It's a poor business model that's collapsed.
SMITH: I got you guys all fired up on a Friday night. Happy New Year to both of you. Thanks for being here.
WOOL: Happy New Year, Sandra, thank you.
SMITH: All right. Tonight marks ten years since Saddam Hussein's execution. And the man who interrogated him beforehand says the brutal dictator gave him warnings for America and sincerely surprised him. Former CIA Analyst John Nixon is here to describe his time with Saddam. Plus, after-terrorist used trucks in Nice and Berlin to kill nearly 100 people, we'll talk to Jonathan Gilliam about what's being done to protect Americans this New Year's eve.
SMITH: Developing tonight, New York City taking unprecedented security measures for New Year's Eve. That means 7,000 police officers on the street and 65 sand filled trucks. But will it be enough to guarantee a secure New Year's Eve like we've seen in the past, and avoid attacks like we've seen in Europe. Joining me now, the man who over saw the FBI special event security in 2010, former Navy Seal Jonathan Gilliam, good to see you, Sir.
JONATHAN GILLIAM: Good to be here.
SMITH: All right. So, New Year's Eve, and we're right -- were right in the heart of it right here.
GILLIAM: We're right in the heart of it.
SMITH: You walk around the crowds are so thick already. You can only imagine Saturday night. It -- I imagine it's a daunting task to ensure the safety and security of the thousands of people that will be on the streets.
GILLIAM: Millions of people. They're estimating 2 million people this year in Times Square alone. Now, we're one block off of it and as we come in, people look behind you and they see Radio City Music Hall and the big picture of what's going on live down there. What I see as an attacker, as I see soft targets, I see soft targets develop and I see them dissipate. And that's what people have to realize is that, as an attacker, as a terrorist, what they're looking for are soft targets to develop. They're looking for the information that you already know by being in and around the areas that you're at on a daily basis, and in this case a special event.
SMITH: I can't even imagine what it's like to coordinate with 7,000 police officers. I mean, what does that even look like and what if something does go wrong?
GILLIAM: Well, it's highly coordinated with NYPD because they're really a militarized unit. They're the biggest law enforcement agency in the world, and almost as big or bigger than most militaries in the world. So, they're organized. But here's the key to this. Is that even the NYPD cannot secure everything. And in Times Square, it's a frozen zone. They're going to have like 65 sand trucks set up to keep large trucks from crashing in there. But it's up to the American citizens that are in there and the people visiting to ask two questions, when, where and how can an attack happen? Think like an attacker, and then look in that direction, and look to see if you see anything odd. The other thing, the other question you have to ask is how do I avoid these, these areas? Because immediately after Times Square, the other thing the NYPD is incredible at doing is getting 2 million people out of time's square and that's where the soft targets develop everywhere. So you have to try to avoid those targets.
SMITH: I mean -- and as far as the threat level is concerned, I mean, we're at the highest threat level, you know, that we've been since the last time you ran this sort of security machine.
GILLIAM: I would just rather people forget about the security threat and just assume that we are always under a threat and an attack is possible anytime.
SMITH: So what do you say to people who say, ""I don't know, should we really go out there?""
GILLIAM: Go out but be smart. You have to think like an attacker and you have to be able to look and say before you go there and say, if there's something that happens, I'm going to go this way. And I'm going to get out of it because you're thinking where would an attack come from?
SMITH: Wow, you did a fantastic job back in 2010. I'm sure New York City is prepared and ready for this. It's a -- it's a very American moment so.
GILLIAM: And you have the best of the best out there. But you also have the most prepared citizenry that are free and have the ability to think like they want to think, think like an attacker tomorrow.
SMITH: All right. Jonathan Gilliam, thanks for being here.
GILLIAM: You got it.
SMITH: Now to ""THE KELLY FILE EXCLUSIVE"". Today marks ten years since Iraq executed its former leader Saddam Hussein. The brutal dictator was captured by U.S. forces back in 2003 and would later be interrogated for weeks by a former CIA analyst who says America still doesn't understand exactly who Saddam Hussein was.
Now, he's speaking publicly for the first time about his history-making encounter. Former CIA Analyst, John Nixon is here, he is an author of the brand new book ""Debriefing the President: The interrogation of Saddam Hussein"". Good of you to be here, and thank you for telling your story, Sir.
JOHN NIXON, FORMER CIA ANALYST: I'm very well. How about -- how about yourself?
SMITH: So, tell us about that. How did this all begin?
NIXON: Well, I was asked to come out to Baghdad and to work on helping find Saddam Hussein, and when we found him I was asked to identify him and I subsequently spent several weeks debriefing him afterwards.
SMITH: And you say this is still a man that many of us don't understand or never really knew.
NIXON: Yes.
SMITH: What did you learn about him during the interrogation process?
NIXON: He -- briefing him produced a lot of surprises. First and foremost was that, at the very end of his reign, he had become largely detached from running the government. He was really busy writing novels at the time and he was not the master manipulator that we at the CIA thought he was.
SMITH: So, you get - you get called to Iraq and then you get called out to actually I.D. him. What was that like?
NIXON: It was fascinating. I was looking for certain tribal markings that he had on his hands and wrist area. And I was also looking for a bullet wound that he'd suffered in an assassination attempt long ago. However, I will admit, the minute I laid eyes on him, after years of watching videotape and years of studying pictures, the minute I laid eyes on him, I knew it was him.
SMITH: And what? What told you that? I mean, because that must have been such a moment.
NIXON: Oh, my gosh, well, I have it in the book, and it's just - you just - you just know.
SMITH: Did he say something to you? Did you say something to him?
NIXON: Well, he looked at me and he had gave me this look that was the similar to the cover of a book I had on him and it sent chills down my spine. And, you know, we talked initially and, you know, sometimes you just know certain things and it's just beyond a shadow of a doubt.
SMITH: What condition was he in?
NIXON: He was in very good condition for a person who had just has his world turned upside down by being captured. He had some minor abrasions and cuts on his arms and on his face from having the capture. But he was actually -- when I saw him, he sort of acted like he came here every Saturday night and, you know, we were his guests.
SMITH: So, we're running a banner at the bottom of the screen that says ""It's not so easy to govern Iraq."" What did he say about that?
NIXON: Yes. Well, that's what we were told, I said, you know, ""Saddam, you're, you know, you're here, you're in prison, your government is no more."" He had said we were -- that United States would lose. And I said, ""Why do you say that?"" And he said, ""Because you're going to find that it's not so easy to govern Iraq."" And then he said, you know, ""You don't understand Iraq. You don't understand the Arabs. You don't understand the Arab mind. You don't know our history, you don't know our culture, you don't know our language."" And I have to admit, he had a point.
SMITH: And as far as our current intelligence relationship, you said that there's something that we need to look back, learn our history, look at this moment. And what do we learn from that moment, John?
NIXON: Well, we learned many things. Number one, we -- if we want to know who somebody is and what a government is up to, maybe instead of trying -- instead of ostracizing them which or trying to at least, we should actually talk to them and have a presence in the country. Because we can learn a lot more than if we're trying to figure things out from a distance.
SMITH: All right, John. Thanks for being here and telling your story. And I know we can learn more as we read your book. Thank you.
NIXON: Well, thank you for having me.
SMITH: All right, with his tweet today, praising Vladimir Putin, President-elect Trump stayed true to form, moving the media and policy needle with the single push of the send button. Up next, we will show you how Mr. Trump dominated the medium and how this might translate to an evolving press going forward. And Kristen Soltis Anderson and Mollie Hemingway join us next.
SMITH: ""DEVELOPING"" tonight from WikiLeaks to Deplorables, we're taking a look back at 2016's attention grabbing political headlines with the help of one of our favorite pollsters, whose company has created a visual representation of what got you talking by analyzing more than 2 billion tweets. I'm joined now by Kristen Soltis Anderson, Republican pollster and Co-founder of Echelon Insights and Mollie Hemingway, Senior Editor at The Federalist. All right, so Kristen, I'll start with you first. Election scandals, the themes that dominated 2016, what did we see?
KRISTEN SOLTIS ANDERSON, REPUBLICAN POLLSTER AND CO-FOUNDER OF ECHELON INSIGHTS: In 2016, people really started tweeting about the election after the conventions happened. And it was the issue of WikiLeaks, the John Podesta e-mails, the DNC e-mails, and this just drip, drip, drip of things that we revealed about Hillary Clinton and her team and their internal discussions that really became a dominant theme in this election.
(CROSSTALK)
SMITH: Yeah, I mean it's amazing. We're looking at a chart here Kristen of this data and that big blue line at the top, that's WikiLeaks hacking. And Clinton's e-mail came in second. But, I mean, you can just see the domination of those election scandals and gaps clearly.
ANDERSON: Yeah, there were other debates, you know, things like Trump University, these moments, where, you know, Judge Curiel, things that were controversies where Donald Trump took a lot of heat. And we don't actually find that the Twitter chatter about those issues had spread very far beyond sort of Beltway elites, Insiders, folks that were already fans of Hillary Clinton. But the stories that sort of got the most mainstream appeal and discussion were ones that were about either Hillary Clinton's e-mails or e- mails that has been hacked from the DNC or from John Podesta.
SMITH: Yeah, Mollie, that probably was a very good news for the Clinton campaign to see that her e-mails were dominating conversation on social media.
MOLLIE HEMINGWAY, SENIOR EDITOR AT THE FEDERALIST: Well, it's interesting to the compare, how it looked with normal media where you would have things that the media decided were really big stories. On Twitter and elsewhere people were more interested in Clinton scandals. This should have been a really good indicator that people were dissatisfied with Clinton, or that the promise that she was having. Whether it was her e-mail server that people perceive as risking national security, the WikiLeaks, or even one of the other things that this research shows is just how significant that comment about Deplorables and Irredeemable Americans was, which we have later learned from people inside the Clinton campaign, they also knew that was a big deal. But it didn't seem like such a big deal in other media coverage. So, you can learn from how people are discussing in their normal habitat what actually captures people.
SMITH: I want to get to some more of this data Kristen because it is fascinating. And you look at the election and the candidates and their share of the conversation. All right, that whole reddish pink area there, that's Donald Trump dominating the conversation. Hillary Clinton in the blue. What a telling story that was.
ANDERSON: Yeah, I mean, Donald Trump was the number one topic among Beltway insiders, among conservatives, among liberals, among our audience of everyone. Normally, I will say it's not a good thing, normally, to be the most discussed topic on Twitter. Typically, we see that for conservatives, Hillary Clinton would be top, for liberals, Donald Trump, for republican, either Jeb Bush, whose a big topic among liberals for a while. But Donald Trump in the end round up dominating everything. And I think one other thing that you'll notice in this chart is that the discussion about Donald Trump was constantly shifting and evolving. There was always a different topic. Whereas for Clinton, it was the e-mails through and through. A single narrative from beginning to end.
SMITH: And Mollie, the data was divided up, election, nonelection topics. I have to have a little fun with this one. This is beyond the election, the stories that defined the year. All right, show it and let me show you what the spike is in the far end. In the later months of the year, the Cubs winning the World Series, thank you. Chicago girl. I confess. All right, I guess we didn't have a graphic up but that was definitely one of the stories that defined the year. Not just the sport's story but across the spectrum. Thanks to both of you for being here tonight. Good the see you.
HEMINGWAY: Thanks.
ANDERSON: Thank you.
SMITH: All right, we will be right back
SMITH: It's been a big year for THE KELLY FILE, that's for sure, and we are so grateful to all of our viewers, both on THE KELLY FILE and Fox News Channel. But from the great ratings to your support for Megyn's new book ""Settle for More"". So, as we close out another year, we hope you will pick up her book.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
(RICKY MARTIN PERFORMING AT THE 2001 INAUGURATION OF PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH)
O'REILLY (voice-over): That was Ricky Martin performing at the 2001 inauguration of President Bush the younger. But this year, many performers are afraid to attend the Trump inauguration. We will tell you exactly what is going on.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: And the phrase make America Great Again, there is one word, if you are a person of color, that you sort of a stumble over, it is the word ""again.""
O'REILLY: New Year, same old story. The far left branding Donald Trump and his supporters racist. Will this ever stop? 
JESSE WATTERS, O'REILLY FACTOR CORRESPONDENT: What was the biggest mistake you made in 2016?
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Following other people's opinions.
WATTERS: Like when everyone said Hillary was going to win?
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: That was a big one.
(LAUGHTER)
O'REILLY: Also ahead, Jesse Watters in Times Square asking people about the New Year.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It's going to be a beautiful year filled with love and acceptance, I'm sure of it.
WATTERS: Did you read that on a hallmark card?
(LAUGHTER)
(END VIDEOTAPE)
O'REILLY: Caution, you are about to enter the No Spin Zone. THE FACTOR begins right now.
Hi, I am Bill O'Reilly. Things were watching us tonight. First edition of 2017. Happy New Year, hope it is a good one for you and your family. Donald Trump's inauguration, that is a subject of this evening's talking points memo. There are wide reports that many entertainers are frightened to perform and the inaugural festivities on January 20th. Hard to pin down, but the roster of performers today is scant. Some of The Rockettes from Radio City Music Hall in New York City will be there. The Mormon tabernacle choir out of Utah is scheduled to perform.
And Jackie Evancho of ""America's Got Talent"" is also set to sing. We hear the Beach Boys in the country group Alabama maybe appearing but that is not been confirmed. Also, not confirmed are some entertainers reportedly believe if they show up at the inauguration, it will hurt their careers. The tenor Andrea Bocelli has been mentioned. Along with Garth Brooks, I should say. But again, we cannot confirm the fear element.
However it is obvious there is a problem, and there should not be one. The inauguration of a president, celebrates a peaceful transition of power engineered by the American voters. That is what the ceremony is, not a political gesture. So, all Americans should respect the process. Even if you don't like the incoming president. It should never be intimidation about attending or performing at inauguration. That is un-American.
The election of George W. Bush in 2000 was perhaps the most controversial vote of the nation's history. Decided by the Supreme Court. Yet, a variety of entertainers showed up at the inauguration, including Ricky Martin, Wayne Newton, Jessica Simpson, Andrew Lloyd Webber, and The Rockettes. Even Beyonce showed up, performing with Destiny's Child as her inaugural concert for America's youth.
So, even though there was bitterness over the Bush-Gore race, the nation came together at the inauguration. But now, that cohesive spirit seems to have changed. The harsh truth is that there is reverse McCarthyism going on in the entertainment industry. Remember that in the 1950s, Wisconsin Senator Joseph McCarthy started accusing people in Hollywood of being communist, that led to a black list where people were not hired because McCarthy smeared them. It seems anti-Trump zealots may be doing the same thing.
If you are a Trump supporter, you are a bad person. And a number of entertainers believe their careers will be harmed should they associate with the new Trump administration. Again, that is terrible and awful state of affairs. ""Talking Points"" believes enough is enough with the anti-Trump movement. The man won the election, give him a chance. Respect the process! And stop the nonsense. And that is the memo.
Now the top story tonight, reaction, joining us from Washington, the New Year's guy, Charles Krauthammer. I have a series of very short questions for you.
First of all, do you believe that to some, may be many entertainers, are frightened to go to Washington because they think their careers may be harmed?
CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER, SYNDICATED COLUMNIST: I have no idea. That's why you presented no evidence to that effect.
O'REILLY: Well, thus far, there are very few booked, and we know that a number of people were asked to appear. But very few said yes.
KRAUTHAMMER: That doesn't prove fear. Hollywood is overwhelmingly, more than 100 percent liberal. And it could very well be that these people for their own political reasons, don't want to perform at a Republican or a Trump inauguration.
O'REILLY: Why did the George W. Bush inauguration have, you know, a good cross-section of entertainers and not the Donald Trump so far?
KRAUTHAMMER: Wayne Newton? Is that your A-list?
O'REILLY: Ricky Martin? Andrew Lloyd Webber? Pretty big names.
KRAUTHAMMER: You know, I find it hard to get exercise over the fact that we may be short a rockette at the inaugural celebration.
O'REILLY: You're dodging the question. You don't believe that there is pressure being put upon entertainers, not to show up? You don't believe that?
KRAUTHAMMER: There is a group called friends of ape, you know them, I know them. A bunch of Hollywood conservatives who meet every once in a while, semi-clandestinely, they won't even publish their membership list because they know that if the word gets out, that they are conservatives it could hurt their careers. That has been true for decades.
O'REILLY: Isn't that reverse McCarthyism?
KRAUTHAMMER: It is deplorable but it is nothing new. And in fact, it is not only in Hollywood. Why do you have all of these conservative think tanks in Washington? The reason is that intellectuals, conservative intellectuals, have not been able to get jobs in elite universities for decades. So, they had to establish their own counter institutions, things like the American Enterprise Institute, Heritage Foundation, et cetera, as an alternative venue.
O'REILLY: Okay.
KRAUTHAMMER: Liberals get control of cultural institutions and conservatives are --
O'REILLY: I think that is far beyond that. I think it is far beyond the general philosophical --
KRAUTHAMMER: That is the sun rising in the east.
O'REILLY: Okay. You basically have, do you agree with me, that in inauguration is a celebration of the peaceful transition of power in the United States? You agree with that?
KRAUTHAMMER: Yes.
O'REILLY: Do you agree that anyone, anyone, who would hold it against someone who performed at inauguration is un-American? That's an un- American act? Would you agree?
KRAUTHAMMER: No, of course not.
O'REILLY: You wouldn't?
KRAUTHAMMER: No, look.
O'REILLY: So, it's okay to deny somebody a job in Charles Krauthammer's world if they show up at the Trump inauguration? That's okay? To deny someone a job?
KRAUTHAMMER: No.
O'REILLY: But that is a cloak of fear that we are dealing with now.
KRAUTHAMMER: But you have shown no evidence that that is a --
O'REILLY: Oh, Stop! The evidence is there's nobody booked. That is the evidence. There is nobody booked, two weeks away.
KRAUTHAMMER: They don't want to play for Donald Trump. This is a republic. You are not summoned to perform for the king or for the dictator. In some places, if Kim Jong-un calls you to sing, you better show up because otherwise you're not going to be --
(CROSSTALK)
O'REILLY: You don't know anything about the Hollywood industry. They will perform for Joseph Stalin, okay, if they think it is going to help their career. Okay? They are afraid, these groups, rock groups, pop groups, even the country people, are afraid that if they do it, that they are going to lose bookings, that they are going to be attacked on the internet, they are going to be smeared all over the place, and so, they are not. I can't believe you are denying this. It is so obvious.
KRAUTHAMMER: I -- I find it extremely hard to get exercised about something which is, that some people will perform for people for whom they have a political affinity. If I were asked to perform at a Clinton inauguration, I could very easily say, yes, I respect the process, and I will do it, that is perfectly fine. Or I could say, no, I think she is a crook. I think she was not -- she would not be the right choice. And therefore, I exercise my right to simply say no.
O'REILLY: And that's fine but you are not in fear of losing your job or a book contract or a speaking engagement. See? I don't mind people exercising their freedom to do what they want to do. I am telling you that there is very ranked fear in the entertainment industry to be associated with President-elect Trump. Last word.
KRAUTHAMMER: There has been ranked fear in Hollywood for decades to be even known as a conservative. You are about 20 years late to the party, Bill. And I don't think the inauguration is sort of this is scandalous exception. This has been true forever. There are many places where liberals will not welcome conservatives. Hollywood, the university, those are just a couple of examples. And you live with it, the way you live with the weather.
O'REILLY: Not me.
(LAUGHTER)
I think the process should be respected and anyone invited should show up just to help their country. Anyway, great debate. Really good way to kick off the New Year, Charles. And we appreciate it.
KRAUTHAMMER: Thank you.
O'REILLY: Next on the rundown, already, the Democrats are threatening to delay confirmation of some Trump cabinet appointees. We will tell you about it.
And later, Watters in Times Square New Year's Eve. Not a good recipe. Those reports after these messages.
O'REILLY: ""Impact Segment"" tonight, to the political stories today, first, Donald Trump continues putting pressure on companies who want to move jobs overseas. In fact, he threatened General Motors for making a car in Mexico.
Also, Ford announced it is canceling, canceling, $1.6 billion factory it was going to build in Mexico. The other big story, politically, is Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer threatening President-elect Trump.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY), SENATE MINORITY LEADER: We will hold President-elect Trump accountable to the values that truly make America great. But we'll fight him tooth and nail when he appeals to the baser instincts that diminish America and its greatness.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
O'REILLY: Joining us now from Austin, Texas, Karl Rove. So, Senator Schumer wants to hold up, delay a bunch of Trump's cabinet appointees. Is that correct?
KARL ROVE, FORMER PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH SENIOR ADVISOR: Yes. This is pretty much a boilerplate speech today, where he said, we will going to define what the values are by which we will judge Donald Trump. If we agree with him, we will help them come, if we oppose him, we disagree, we will oppose him. This was sort of a standard stuff. What is more dangerous is, is that the Democrats have announced that there are eight appointees, eight nominees of President-elect Trump to the cabinet that they are going to oppose and delay them as long as until March.
Now, this is just obstructionism, pure and simple. This is an attempt to make it difficult for him to put together a government, make it difficult for him to take early actions and some critical departments. And it is an obstructionism that is a jaw-dropping. Particularly, if you look back at the historic record, here is what happened with President Obama came in. Did the Republicans obstruct? No. Did they ask tough questions? Yes.
But think about this, within two days of being sworn into office, seven of his cabinet members have been approved, six of them on voice votes. One of them was approved, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, 94 to two. And a couple of days later, they approved it by voice vote on the 23rd, the transportation secretary, on the 26th, Tim Geithner, who had not paid his taxes and had to undergo a rough confirmation fight, he was approved on 60- 34.
Basically, within one week of the President being sworn in. HUD Secretary, within eight days. Ten of the 15, excuse me, ten of the 14th that had to go through confirmation were approved within basically eight days of the President being sworn in. Two more were approved in February, one of them was delayed until late February because she -- Hilda Solis, the Labor Secretary, her husband had not paid taxes.
And then, we had two of them that were completely President Obama's fault. The Commerce Secretary in March because he went through two cabinet secretary nominations and had to be withdrawn before he finally got to the third run. And then finally, the HHS Secretary Sibelius, remember, Tom Daschle had to withdraw himself for not having paid taxes on the third of February.
O'REILLY: Right.
ROVE: She is nominated and approved basically five weeks.
O'REILLY: All right. So, I mean, look, the point is that when President Obama took office, the Republicans didn't try to sabotage him.
ROVE: Right.
O'REILLY: It looks like Schumer and his crew is going to try to sabotage Trump. The question is, they can't stop these appointments, like Sessions as Attorney General.
ROVE: No.
O'REILLY: So, they just try to embarrass the President and the individual appointees. Try to embarrass them, right?
ROVE: Right, exactly. And draw it out. So that look, they don't want the White House to be coming out with the lot of initiatives, they're moving forward. They want them to, you know, this is like a holding action while Trump is trying to undo a lot of what Obama did in trying to repeal ObamaCare and replace it, and trying to get a tax cut through, and tax reform. They want him tied down.
That is why they are going after people like the Secretary of Treasury nominee, Mnuchin, that is why they are going after the Attorney General Jeff Sessions, the Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. There are couples that are payback, they're going after Betsy DeVos, the Education Secretary because the Democratic Party is lock, stock, and barrel by the Teacher Unions.
O'REILLY: Yes.
ROVE: And she is a fighter for school choice. They are going after --
(CROSSTALK)
O'REILLY: All right. That is politics over --
ROVE: Yes. Absolutely.
O'REILLY: Let's get into, you know, it looks like Trump is going to be the strong man and he is calling out GM for making a car in Mexico and trying to embarrass them. But, you know, all of a sudden, Ford says, you know what? We are not going to build a $1.6 billion plant in Mexico, and we are going to build it in the USA, and all the jobs that come along with it. So, it looks like being a strong man is working for Trump. At least in the beginning.
ROVE: Well, maybe. Look, I accept that the Ford CEO today in his statement saying, look, we made this decision because it is in the best interest of our company. The facility in Mexico is un-needed, we're going to keep the small car production there. But we aren't selling enough of those cars, so, we're not going to expand it. And we need to expand production in the U.S. of the kinds of cars that Americans are buying.
O'REILLY: Yes.
ROVE: But we got to be careful about this. GM, let's think about this. The implication is, you're building a bunch of cars in Mexico and shipping them into the United States. That is fundamentally not true. In Lordstown, Ohio, there is a facility that since 2010, since being up and then, has made 1.3 million Chevy Cruisers. And in the United States, 1.1 million roughly have been bought. The other 200,000 were sold elsewhere, primarily in Canada. The facility in Mexico supplies the foreign markets. We have had about a million won U.S. purchases of Chevy Cruisers. There have been a million three --
O'REILLY: All right. But so what? You know the foreign market can be supplied in Michigan? And so, what?
ROVE: May be. But look, a couple of things.
O'REILLY: I don't have a lot of time. Wrap it up.
ROVE: Mexico has better trade agreements with other countries than we do. And we can make that product in Mexico and sell it and bring the profits back to the U.S. We couldn't make that product.
O'REILLY: Putting the tires on a car, Mr. Rove. As long as the strongman stuff doesn't get out of control, I think it's a good thing.
ROVE: I think it is getting very close to it.
O'REILLY: All right. Directly ahead, while the far left ever stop demonizing Trump supporters as racist? And later, a survey says more conservatives in America than liberals, but the gap is closing. THE FACTOR is coming right back.
O'REILLY: ""Personal Story"" segment tonight, almost from the beginning of the Donald Trump's campaign for the presidency, the far left has this been demonizing him and his supporters as racist.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
And the phrase Make America Great Again, there is one word that if you are a person of color that you sort of stumble over, and it is the word ""again."" Because you are talking about going back to a time that was not very comfortable for people of color.
O'REILLY: And joining us now from Washington Lisa Boothe and Juan Williams. So, I don't think their racism play, want, will ever stop them, what do you think?
JUAN WILLIAMS, CO-HOST, ""THE FIVE"": I think you are right. I think you are right on target. I think to me, it is almost like, why am I arguing here about Make America Great Again. This is a small potatoes. It's like evidence of sort of liberal or left-wing oversensitivity to my mind. But, you know, if you want to make the case, I guess you could say Trump has a history, you know, discrimination in the housing that he built, saying Blacks are responsible for most of the White murders in the country, it's crazy stuff. But again, to me, it is just evidence of people --
O'REILLY: I'm more --
(CROSSTALK)
WILLIAMS: Argue about his policy.
O'REILLY: Look, what do you think, Juan, the phrase ""Make America Great Again"" refers to? What?
WILLIAMS: Well, I think, what struck me when I first heard it, was make America great again, but I guess he is talking about Obama. So, I was thinking about the politics of it that he doesn't like Obama policy.
O'REILLY: No. Make America Great Again --
WILLIAMS: Bill Clinton said it was a way of wink and a nod, a dog whistle, to White southerners.
LISA BOOTHE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, guess what, Bill --
O'REILLY: What do we care the Bill Clinton says, he is campaigning for his wife.
WILLIAMS: Correct.
O'REILLY: What do you think Make America Great Again, that refers to, Lisa? What?
BOOTHE: Well, I think it refers to it Reagan had said when he was the slogan, restoring the American dream.
O'REILLY: Very good.
BOOTHE: Rebuilding America.
O'REILLY: Lisa Boothe, everyone!
BOOTHE: But Bill --
O'REILLY: It's the Reagan years! It's when America was dominant in foreign policy, exercised at superpower status, that was not a racist era, Juan. Come on!
BOOTHE: But I have to tell you this, though. Because Juan had mentioned the fact that Bill Clinton was saying that the slogan was a racist dog whistle. Guess who use the slogan repeatedly when he ran for president in 1992? President Bill Clinton. So, that is just how ridiculous the left is, the fact that President Bill Clinton is using this slogan to malign Donald Trump when he used it himself. You are right, the left --
O'REILLY: Okay. We're going to rundown all the hypocrisy.
WILLIAMS: Here is my argument with Lisa. I think Lisa you have to realize that when Bill Clinton set it, he didn't say again and again and again. And you know, to me --
O'REILLY: Oh, please. Oh, my gosh. Juan, get out of here.
WILLIAMS: No, no, hold on.
BOOTHE: Oh, come on!
WILLIAMS: I think America is a great country right now. I look at the stock market, I look at gas prices, the unemployment, I look at the opportunities for Blacks, Latinos, immigrants, women, Lisa, more than ever in our history.
O'REILLY: All right, this lady -- wait, wait. This lady from NPR has said the sound bite on CBS. She's basically saying, look, America is a racist nation. Yes, we may have made some improvements, as you just pointed out. But if you say, ""Make America Great Again,"" anything that happened in America, anything, defeating the axis powers, Japan, you can't say that was great because people of color were getting hammered. Which is partially true, by the way.
WILLIAMS: Wait, wait, wait. How is that true? Wait a minute. How was that true?
BOOTHE: This is absolutely, utterly ridiculous. And Juan, to your earlier point, the reality is that when Donald Trump was running for president, you have the majority of Americans who felt that this country was on the wrong track, even the majority of Americans who felt like their children or grandchildren were going to inherit a nation that was less good off than the one that they have had and the one that they have enjoyed.
WILLIAMS: Lisa, the fact is --
BOOTHE: That is what Donald Trump meant by make America great again.
O'REILLY: All right, Juan. Go, Juan.
BOOTHE: Let's make America strong again, let's rebuild the country economically.
WILLIAMS: Lisa, you go back to win George W. Bush won in 2004, a majority of Americans thought the country was headed in the wrong direction. That is not the measure. I think that America is great when it can beat the Nazis, the access is Bill O'Reilly just said.
BOOTHE: I think America is great --
(CROSSTALK)
O'REILLY: Lisa, let him finish. Lisa.
WILLIAMS: I don't think that means that you can't also - what the civil rights movement at the time call a double beat, victory abroad and victory at home over racism and discrimination.
O'REILLY: All right. But you can't as that woman implied, Juan, you can't say that America, if you say make America great again, again, that goes back to the '80s, that is a vision of the Trump people, okay?
WILLIAMS: Okay.
O'REILLY: But you can't do it because it was inequality in certain times. America was great --
WILLIAMS: Oh, I think so.
O'REILLY: -- in freeing the world from Hitler and Tojo. However, back home, things weren't that great for minorities. But you have to put everything into perspective. And that woman doesn't.
WILLIAMS: I agree with you.
O'REILLY: She condemns her country and I didn't like it. All right. Good debate. Good debate. I got to go.
WILLIAMS: I just ask you to realize that people who are Blacks, Latinos, given what he said about immigrants --
BOOTHE: Oh, come on, Juan. America is great when --
(CROSSTALK)
O'REILLY: All right. You guys continue among yourselves. We have to take a break.
Plenty more ahead. THE FACTOR moves along this evening. Gutfeld and McGuirk on how racial politics are hurting the USA.
And later, Watters in Times Square on New Year's Eve.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: What is the biggest mistake that you made in 2016?
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Not watching you on TV enough.
WATTERS: That's the best answer I heard all day.
O'REILLY: And we hope you stay tuned for those reports.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
O'REILLY: ""What The Heck Just Happened"" segment tonight, as you just heard, there is no letup in playing the race card by the far left. The question are, our Americans growing dumb to it or will they get worse in 2017?
And here they are, New Year's guys, Bernard McGuirk and Greg Gutfeld. I am so tired of this, Gutfeld, I really am. I mean, I take it personally, not a Trump supporter, per se, never endorsed him, or anything like that, I think I gave him a fair shot on the program.
GREG GUTFELD, FOX NEWS CO-HOST, ""THE FIVE"": Uh-hm.
O'REILLY: But the interviews were tough, as many people pointed out. However, I know a lot of people who supported Donald Trump. Of course, I am one of them. Okay?
BERNARD MCGUIRK, HOST, THE BERNIE AND SID SHOW: Absolutely.
O'REILLY: And I am supposed to sit here and allow them to be called racist?
GUTFELD: Yes. Because they are. You know what it is? Liking Donald Trump is not liking Obama of 2016. Remember, if you didn't like Obama, you were racist. Now, if you like Trump, you are racist.
O'REILLY: So, you are double racist.
GUTFELD: You are racist cubed. You know, there is a left wing superhero, it is called a race man. The only power it has is to throw accusations of bigotry at you.
O'REILLY: Right.
GUTFELD: The great thing about 2016, 2016 is the kryptonite, it took away the power from race man. And that is why they are imploding everywhere because of the more the boy cried wolf --
O'REILLY: Do you really think they are imploding, though?
GUTFELD: Every time you employ mockery against somebody calling you a racist, they fail, and you create free new Trump supporters.
O'REILLY: What do you say?
MCGUIRK: Well, he is absolutely right about that. It's overused. The accusation, leveling that accusation is so overused. Look, they had Ellen DeGeneres with a racist in 2016. I mean --
O'REILLY: Yes. Usain Bolt thing --
MCGUIRK: That's right.
O'REILLY: -- cartoon. Right.
MCGUIRK: It is the last refuge really of a skunk with no argument, essentially. And yes, they want to leverage it against Donald Trump because he won, they are frustrated. They want to keep it up. So, I don't think it is going to stick, I mean, you know, against it.
O'REILLY: But they are not going to stop.
MCGUIRK: They are not going to stop but he can chip away at it slowly. I mean, look, you had Jim Brown over at the Trump Tower talking nice about Donald Trump. I understand Bill and Hillary Clinton are going to go to the inauguration.
O'REILLY: That is what I hear.
MCGUIRK: Slowly, if he improves the economy and the inner cities, they can chip away at it. But they will always use it. They use it against Bush, who was a compassionate conservative. They had George Bush 43 dragging black people behind in chains behind a pickup truck if you remember that. So, it is a playbook that they always go back to. But one that people are seeing through and are sick and tired of.
O'REILLY: All right. Per se, to our interview with Charles Krauthammer at the top program, this plays into the difficulty of booking inaugural talent. Because these entertainers, not the brightest people, many of them, and the world, you know, the blacks aren't going to like me if I show up or maybe the Hispanics aren't going to like me. So, I got to sit this one out because there's all that --
GUTFELD: It's not about that. It's about their peers. They are actually being punished by the people that they compete against. So, if a musician says, they're going to go on, then a comedian goes on Twitter and says, you're a racist. So, it is more about their being intimidated by the people and their own profession. Most people --
O'REILLY: I mean, look, a guy like Andrea Bocelli and the Trump campaign says it didn't, you know, invite him.
MCGUIRK: Meanwhile, a disabled immigrant, anyway --
O'REILLY: Right. It looks like there is some truth to the fact that Mr. Bocelli is frightened. He is frightened because he is a friend of Trump. Why wouldn't he go sing a couple songs?
MCGUIRK: Nobody wants to be accused of that. You are absolutely right about that, it is such an onerous accusation to have slapped against you. But again, and the reason why they hate Trump so much is that he is unbowed by it, he is not cowed by it, he actually just fights back. He doubles down. And that is why they really hate Donald Trump.
O'REILLY: It's not working. I will see that point.
GUTFELD: I'm happy to perform there, by the way.
O'REILLY: What would you exactly do?
GUTFELD: I'm a plate spinner.
O'REILLY: Oh, is that right?
GUTFELD: Yes. It is amazing. I can spend place with every part of my body.
O'REILLY: I heard. And we really don't want that image ingrained.
GUTFELD: Yes.
O'REILLY: I heard that you will going to bring back --
GUTFELD: Yes, I am.
O'REILLY: The little Italian mouse.
GUTFELD: Yes. He is quite adorable. You know, I hide him.
MCGUIRK: This is how Trump can actually curb the hate that he can transition to a woman. I think that would just solve everything.
O'REILLY: You mean, he could become a woman?
MCGUIRK: Donald Trump. He would break glass.
O'REILLY: Donald Trump.
MCGUIRK: Donald Trump, he would look damn good in a dress. I mean, you know, use the stair master.
O'REILLY: I don't think that is going to happen.
MCGUIRK: But I mean, it is possible. Another way to chip away --
O'REILLY: It's not possible.
MCGUIRK: Stupid, frivolous charges of racism, all the time.
O'REILLY: All right. And on that note. It is not possible. When we come right back, new survey says, there are more conservatives in America than Liberals, but the trends are changing. And Watters going wild on New Year's Eve, up ahead.
O'REILLY: Thanks for staying with us. I am Bill O'Reilly in the ""Unresolved Problem Segment"" tonight. Ideology. According to a Gallup Survey, 36 percent of the American adult population now describe themselves as conservative. Twenty five percent as neoliberal. Thirty four percent, moderate. Five years ago, the number was 40 percent conservative, 21 percent liberal, 35 percent moderate.
So, the left is gaining. The question is, why?
Joining us now from Seattle, conservative radio talk show host Michael Medved, author of the new book, ""The American Miracle.""
So, Michael, are you surprised that the liberal trend is on the rise and why do you think it is going up?
MICHAEL MEDVED, RADIO TALK SHOW HOST: Oh, I don't think it is going up very much. Mostly, it's on the rise among Democrats. In other words, what is happened is people who are moderate have left the Democratic Party and have gone over to the Republican Party or to no identification. And what you really are seeing is more and more Democrats who are now okay with gay marriage, are now okay with legalized marijuana, are now okay with transgendered issues, and now, okay with abortion on demand.
So, all of a sudden, the word ""liberal"" doesn't have that stigma that it once did. But let's be clear. Seventy five percent of the American electorate, even according to the new Gallup poll, are not liberal. They are moderate.
O'REILLY: Right. They're not liberals. But a four-point rise in the liberal identification, as opposed to a four-point drop in conservative, tells me, and this is why I think it is happening, that the media, which is more unrelentingly liberal today than it was five years ago, it is really everywhere, entertainment, news, even sports, even sports.
MEDVED: Right.
O'REILLY: The media moving left and promoting the left point of view, that's why this, the dial is moving, I think.
MEDVED: But it has always been that way. I mean --
O'REILLY: But not as overt as it is now.
MEDVED: I would suggest that every bit as overt as it is now. I mean, the media, for instance, in terms of the gay rights agenda, has been very, very energetic on that issue for very many, many years. The point about this is that the solid base of conservatism has not been dented or damage. In the last two elections, the exit polls show that 34 percent and 35 percent of Americans describe themselves as conservative, still, an 11-point gain on liberals. And here is the key thing.
Liberals cannot win without winning overwhelming percentages of moderates. And the more and more of the Democratic Party goes over to the extreme left, that you are talking about, the tougher time that they are going to have winning those moderates that they need to win, conservatives can win as Trump did, without winning moderates. But Trump came closer among moderates than --
O'REILLY: All right. It's a good point that in order to regain power, because you know that Senator from Massachusetts, Elizabeth Warren, is going to run for president. She has already, you know, billed the days. Bernie, I don't think Bernie Sanders, I don't think he's going to do it again. But she will. All right? But there is no outreach to moderates from Elizabeth Warren. It's like, Wall Street is evil, everybody exploits -- Trump is a racist, as we just talked about, there is no outreach. So, you are right. It's going to be very hard for her to get traction. But I do believe that there is a sensibility. And you see it in the marijuana thing. In your state.
MEDVED: Yes.
O'REILLY: All right. You see that.
MEDVED: Sure.
O'REILLY: That's 15 years ago, most Americans were against marijuana. But now, it has been glorified by the media and accepted by the media, so, the kids, the younger people go, yes, there is nothing wrong with marijuana. We have a study out of Colorado that says that if you spoke marijuana every day, you will going to be in serious physical trouble. That just came up. Go ahead.
MEDVED: Yes. That is absolutely true. But the point is that Donald Trump cuts beyond all of this. And you may have noticed, he does not wrap himself in the term ""conservative.""
O'REILLY: No.
MEDVED: Donald Trump is about winning. He is about pragmatism.
O'REILLY: Right.
MEDVED: It is about results. In all of this is going to matter how many people in Gallup say I am liberal, whatever that means, how many people say I'm conservative, how many people say I'm moderate. What is going to matter is if Trump convinces Americans that the country is moving in the right direction.
O'REILLY: Well, and that is all economics. But you have to see that his appointments, cabinet appointments, have been conservative and he will appoint a conservative Supreme Court Justice nominee. So --
MEDVED: He doesn't know. Absolutely.
(CROSSTALK)
O'REILLY: Yes. Well, he does doesn't describe himself that way, all of his actions are tailored to the right. Now, I want you to tell everybody why they should buy your book, ""American Miracle."" What is the miracle?
MEDVED: The miracle is the mere existence of this country and the fact that a group of very struggling, straggling colonies ended up being the dominant nation in the world. And it is no accident. The subtitle of the book is ""Divine Providence on the Rise of the Republic."" And that America is the product not of random evolution or a series of accidents or a series of happy accidents. America is the product of a plan.
All our founders, all of our leaders, including Jackson and Lincoln, Reagan, and even Barack Obama, have conceded there is some kind of higher power guiding American destiny. I love the quote by Bismarck, he says, ""I know that God grants special protection for imbeciles, lost children, drunkards, and the United States of America."" May that continue.
O'REILLY: Wow! I don't know of that is good company, but it's a good quote. Michael, thank you very much. We appreciate it. Watters on deck. He's roaming around Times Square on New Year's Eve. You can watch what happens, next.
O'REILLY: ""Back to the Book"" segment tonight, ""Watters' World,"" as you may know, Jesse Watters is working on New Year's Eve. Not exactly sure what he was doing in Times Square, but he was there. And he did double duty for us.

O'REILLY: So, here's Watters, the lady predicted Mariah Carey meltdown. He nailed it. And it was what? Eight hours before the fact?
WATTERS: Pretty much.
O'REILLY: Did you see Mariah?
WATTERS: I was at home at that point.
O'REILLY: You're home?
WATTERS: I was off at ten. So, I had to get out of here for the ball to drop.
O'REILLY: You had a curfew.
WATTERS: Yes. I did a curfew after what happened last year.
O'REILLY: Yes. Most people seemed optimistic, that is good. Right?
WATTERS: Yes. Some of them seemed optimistic and a lot of them were upset because they had been standing in the freezing cold since 9:00 a.m. with no food and no restrooms. But I think they perked up when they saw me, obviously.
O'REILLY: Number one, it wasn't freezing, it was 45 degrees at midnight.
WATTERS: You know what I mean by cold, though.
O'REILLY: No, I don't. And number two, you are in Times Square. So, there are restaurants around. You can get some food.
WATTERS: No. They were ordering pizza delivery, Domino's was coming --
(CROSSTALK)
They caged you in. Once you are in, you are in.
O'REILLY: You are in, you are in.
WATTERS: You never go to Times Square?
O'REILLY: I am afraid. It frightens me. When I saw Mariah Carey, I was terrified. I didn't know what was going to happen.
WATTERS: I think she was just as terrified.
O'REILLY: You know, I don't know whether she knew where she was. I mean, did you see it?
WATTERS: Maybe she was part of the alien invasion.
O'REILLY: I think that's right. A couple of people feel that there is going to be an alien invasion.
WATTERS: That is right.
O'REILLY: That's what makes America a great place. All right. Watters, and I want to remind everybody that Watters, in ten days, will make his debut in this spin stops here, your live show with Dennis Miller and myself.

FACTOR ""Tip of the Day,"" a resolution that you have to hear. The ""Tip"" moments away as THE FACTOR continues all across the USA and all around the world.
O'REILLY: FACTOR ""Tip of the Day,"" a New Year's resolution that should be important to you. But first, we see some very good news on January 1st. FACTOR once again rule the cable TV landscape. A dominant number one across the board in 2016, and we thank you all for that. Also Killing the Rising Sun, the number one adult hardback book of the year by a wide margin. That counts fiction as well. We are very pleased, we understand it's all because of you guys.
Now the mail.
Akira Yamamoto, Bloomfield Hills, Michigan. ""I'm tired of the meaningless news and tweets from both the far left and the far right. Bill, where do you suggest we get our news?"" Tough one Akira.
The Wall Street Journal shoots pretty straight most of the time. The economist magazine is left editorially, but it's target news coverage is pretty accurate. Investor's Business Daily tells the truth, on TV it's dicey, everywhere. But the ""60 Minutes"" crew works hard to be accurate. Not an easy thing to find fair and balanced news. I mean, we, that's our slogan here, and I think that FOX News tries hard to provide that. But it's difficult.
Mark Campbell, Mason, Ohio. ""Bill, I have to call you out for failing to point out issues with Common Core and the avalanche of lies used to support global warming.""
Two of my least favorite subjects, Mark. Common Core is a local educational issue, one I cannot possibly define with any accuracy. Global warming is real but no one knows whether it's a natural cycle situation, man-made, or a combination of both. I always say that clean climate is best, we should all work towards that and stop the political garbage.
Greg Russell, Bullhead City, Arizona. ""Someone needs to tell Donald Trump to stop being a battologist.""
A battologist, meaning a person who repeats words. Battologist. I've never used that because I can barely say it. All right?
A person who over uses certain words. But it works for Mr. Trump, hasn't it? His message got through.
Larry Latever, Bellevue, Washington. ""As a retired military officer who knew many of the players in Killing the Rising Sun, I was impressed by the accuracy of the book.""
Well, I appreciate that, Larry.
Edward Fallos, Ellenton, Florida. ""Being a new BillO'Reilly.com Premium Member, I chose Killing the Rising Sun as my free book, I did not want it to end.""
Warner Lowenberg, Tegucigalpa, Honduras. ""O'Reilly, you referred to Angela Merkel as prime minister. Her correct title is Chancellor of Germany.""
I misspoke Warner, nice pickup by you. When I said it, I even know, and then I corrected it later. But I am sorry about that. I shouldn't make those kinds of mistakes.
And finally tonight, a New Year's resolution that you should hear. There's no question that Social Security payments are going to have to change in the next few years, the government is running out of money to pay his obligations and modifications are going to be made. That means that many of us will get less money from the government even though we paid into this Social Security fund for decades. Our expectations will not be met by the Feds in the future. So, here's the resolution.
Starting today, save as much money as you possibly can. You have to do it methodically. Start off with putting five percent of your net income every month in the bank. I know you are not getting a lot of interest but just put it there. Then get it up to 10 percent if you can. I know it's difficult. But if you do it, it will be much better off in the future. Protect yourself. Put the money away. The Social Security thing is coming. FACTOR ""Tip of the Day.""
That's it for us tonight. Please check out the FOX News FACTOR website different from BillO'Reilly.com. Also, we would like you to spout off about THE FACTOR from anywhere in the world. O'Reilly@FOXNews.com O'Reilly@FOXNews.com Name and town if you wish to opine. Word of the day, do not be banal when writing to THE FACTOR.
And tomorrow, we are going to get into Chicago and San Francisco. Murder rate in Chicago scandalous. Nobody doing anything about it. San Francisco's property crime. Crazy. We are going to tell you why it is happening. Again, thanks for watching us tonight. I am Bill O'Reilly, please always remember, the spin stops here. We're definitely looking out for you."
0	49	 50 von 72	Fox News Network	January 3, 2017 Tuesday	 TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT	 7:00 PM EST		"TUCKER CARLSON, FOX NEWS HOST: Good evening and welcome to ""Tucker Carlson Tonight.""
2016 marked a long and violent year in the life of the city of Chicago. 3550 shootings, 762 murders, that's an average of more than two killings every single day and it's getting worse. This year's death toll marked a 57 percent increase over the year before. So what is going on in Chicago?
Well, to many politicians and activists, the answer is obvious. There are too many guns and not enough restrictions on those guns. But wait, Chicago already has some of the strictest gun control laws in the country, and those laws have not gotten any looser. Could it be that the last central assumption about gun control is wrong?
Joining us now is Joshua Horwitz. He's the deputy director of Coalition to Stop Gun Violence. 
Joshua, thanks for coming on.
JOSHUA HORWITZ, DEPUTY DIRECTOR, COALITION TO STOP GUN VIOLENCE: Hey, thanks for having me. I appreciate it.
CARLSON: So if you look at the numbers, and I have, there doesn't seem to be any direct correlation between gun ownership and acts of violence. So, more Americans own guns than they did 20 years ago. A lot more. And there are far more guns per person in America than there were 20 years ago. And the homicide rate has dropped dramatically. If gun control is the answer, how can that be right?
HORWITZ: Well, I think we got to talk about some of the assumptions that you made. First of all, gun ownership across the board is not up. Gun ownership concentrated in less individuals is, as you mention, owning more and more guns. But here's what's interesting.
I think in the last -- you know, in the last couple years, you have seen some of the results of our guns everywhere policies, in the number of different states. And we are seeing the murder rate and gun homicide rate go up. 14 to 15 and of course 15 to 16, one of the final numbers. But we can imagine that gun violence is, in fact, now going up.
So I think we have to sort of look at that and say, you know, what's going on in the United States. Have we loosened gun laws too much? Where are we with that? And I think, as we've discussed, I mean, I really believe gun ownership, per se, has an effect on the suicide rate. But I think that on the homicide rate, you have a much more complex picture.
CARLSON: Well, then, but wait. I mean, I have been told since I was a child that the reason there are so many murders in places like Detroit and Chicago is because there are not enough gun laws, or they are going across state lines to buy guns.
If that's true, if more guns concentrated results in more killings, then why do the states with the loosest gun laws have the lowest murder rates, which is true? (INAUDIBLE)
(CROSSTALK)
HORWITZ: So that's not true. I mean, there are some states that have loose gun laws that have low murder rates. But there are also some states, for instance, Louisiana, Arizona, --
CARLSON: South Carolina.
HORWITZ: Very lax gun laws and very high homicide rate.
CARLSON: But the highest -- but, look, I'm not arguing that there is a direct correlation between loose gun laws and low murder rates.
HORWITZ: Right.
CARLSON: I'm merely arguing that gun control doesn't make you safer. That's pretty obvious based on the numbers. So why are you still running a gun-control organization?
HORWITZ: OK. So let me say just to give you an example. There is a really interesting study out of Missouri recently, OK?
So Missouri gets rid of their gun violence prevention laws, right? So that they have ""a permit to purchase"" law and they have some concealed carry restrictions. Those are all gone. And their homicide rate -- their gun homicide rate goes up 25 percent. So the evidence is getting closer and closer.
I mean, we really believe the evidence is showing that, in fact, not -- you know, a group of gun prevention laws, in fact, do lower the homicide rate.
CARLSON: OK, so, Chicago, 3500 shootings last year, 762 murders. What gun laws would have prevented that?
HORWITZ: So, Illinois has OK gun laws, OK? So they don't have the best, they don't have the worst. But what they do have is most of their -- 60 percent of their gun end up in crime come from other states. And most other states, of course, think about Wisconsin, Mississippi, Indiana leads both way there, right?
So those guns are coming in from those states with weak gun laws. And they are going across borders and they are ending up in crime in Chicago.
So what we really need to do is to make sure that the evidence-based laws that we think work, background checks, et cetera, that we have them on a national basis, because Illinois is in a very --
CARLSON: But, hold on, I've heard this argument. So New York City has seen a dramatic drop in gun crime, right?
HORWITZ: Right and they have great gun laws.
CARLSON: And it's right south of Vermont, which has the laxest gun laws in America. You can get in a car and drive up there. So why isn't that the same?
HORWITZ: Because, first of all, New York -- New York, first of all, same things in line -- where the crime and guns are coming from out of state. But New York is in a much safer neighborhood right? So you have to go quite some distance to get a firearm. You can't just go --
CARLSON: Really?
HORWITZ: Oh yes. Because it seems like everyone I know in New York has a weekend home in Vermont. Look, the point is this step doesn't work and you know it doesn't work.
HORWITZ: I think the evidence shows that it works and that's important.
CARLSON: Then why isn't it working in Chicago? I mean, really, is the real reason it's all the fault of Indiana? I mean, really?
HORWITZ: Let me ask you a question. Do you think we would be better off in Chicago with more firearms?
CARLSON: It depends. In the hands of whom?
HORWITZ: Right.
CARLSON: I would be better off in Chicago with a firearm. And yet it's almost impossible for me to get one in Chicago because the laws are so -- there are gun stores in Chicago. I have to register it as if I'm a criminal.
(CROSSTALK)
HORWITZ: No, no, actually not. Illinois does not have registration. They only have license.
CARLSON: The city of Chicago does. Yes, it does. You have to buy a license to have a gun.
HORWITZ: Illinois has a license. And what you do is you get a license. Actually, it goes for ten years.
CARLSON: So I have to ask permission from the authorities. I'm -- look, the only point is, you are, for example, I go into your Web site and you say, one of the big problems is assault rifles. So of the 762 murders in Chicago, how many were kind of assault rifles?
HORWITZ: Well, I don't know if that's from my Web site, but let me tell you --
(CROSSTALK)
CARLSON: Well, yes, it is. I actually have it right here.
HORWITZ: So let me explain to you about assault weapons. Assault weapons make killing more lethal, OK? So what we have in that situation, assault weapons have more deaths per shooting. They don't necessarily cause more shootings. But when you use an assault weapon in a crime, you end up with more people dead.
(CROSSTALK)
CARLSON: But, OK, so in Chicago, there are 762 murders last year. How many were committed with so called assault weapons?
HORWITZ: But you know what, that's a small issue.
CARLSON: But what's the answer?
HORWITZ: Well, I don't know. I don't know.
CARLSON: But you run a gun control group. And you are approaching for right here -- semi-automatic, military-style firearms designed for one person to kill people. But we have the city with one of the highest murder rates in the country, and how many were committed with assault weapons?
HORWITZ: But I think the better question is how many guns were traffic without background checks? That's what I spend my day working on. I want to figure out how do we prevent guns from being traffic.
And let me give you another example. We have a terribly weak federally anti-trafficking law right now. And one of the biggest issues, and I'm sure you agree with me, and this is a bipartisan issue.
If you are trafficking firearms, there should be a real penalty for it. And you should -- and there should be federal deterrence. We don't have that in this country. And that's why a number of Republicans and --
CARLSON: You know, you haven't sold me. You haven't explained why a state like Vermont or Maine or Idaho or Wyoming, or Texas, where I can buy ammunition at a gas station have such low murder rates.
HORWITZ: I will tell you what, because the crime rate is low.
CARLSON: But why are the crimes? I mean, there is no direct correlation. This point I want to make you. I realize this is a complex question.
(CROSSTALK)
HORWITZ: It is very complex.
(CROSSTALK)
CARLSON: But gun-control is held up by the left as something we could do, we just don't have the will because the evil NRA is stopping us. And the truth is, there are more guns than people in America. If we pass every single law you wanted, do you really think that the murder rate in Chicago would drop?
HORWITZ: Yes, I absolutely do.
CARLSON: You really do?
HORWITZ: I do because the states that are supplying guns to Chicago would be forced to do background checks. We had a trafficking law. It would make as much --
CARLSON: And so criminals, many of these guns come from theft, as you know, or they are sold between people who don't obey the law. So, these people are by definition, beyond the reach of the law. A little naive to believe that they are going to obey these laws.
HORWITZ: Oh yes. I'm not -- it's on the law-abiding gun owner, right?
Here's the thing, right now, you can transfer a firearm, completely above board. You know, you can go on, sell it on an Internet site or whatever to someone without doing a background check. That person may be a criminal, may not be. But here is the thing. We want to make sure that the law- abiding gun owners not transferring into the criminal market.
Look, the law-abiding gun owners is going to -- will do the right thing. But it's really, it's really the issue of how do we not transfer guns in --
CARLSON: But what if the law-abiding gun owner wants to own what you called a military-style assault weapon? Why can't he do that? And, second, what is a military-style assault weapon?
HORWITZ: So let me give you the definition first. So it's a center fire rifle.
CARLSON: Right.
HORWITZ: OK? With a detachable magazine. OK? So above .22 caliber.
CARLSON: OK.
HORWITZ: Some fire detachable.
CARLSON: Right.
HORWITZ: With a grip below the stock and something on the front to hold it. So those are the definitions of assault --
CARLSON: Well, that's not so different from my .30-06, a deer rifle, so why --
HORWITZ: It is different to you. Do you have thumbhole stock on that and a detachable magazine and a --
CARLSON: Yes, it's got a detachable magazine.
(CROSSTALK)
HORWITZ: Let me tell you why --
CARLSON: Who cares what the stock is like? I mean, this suggest you don't know much about guns to me.
HORWITZ: I think it really matters. And I think maybe you haven't shot. Have you shot an AR-15?
CARLSON: Yes, I own one.
HORWITZ: OK, great. So what's important about an AR-15? An important about an AR-15 is you can keep your barrel, your muzzle on the target round after round after round. You don't have to reload. It's meant to kill people.
So here's what I think we should do. If you own one, I think we treat them the same way we treat machine guns. And people at the NRA says all the time, machine guns don't cause any crime.
CARLSON: Yes.
HORWITZ: I believe, and this is a bill introduced by Representative Cicilline from Rhode Island that we should treat them just like any other class three weapon and have the same --
CARLSON: But the distinction or difference. Let me just ask you one final question. What round do you think is deadlier? The .223 that fires from the military-style assault weapon or the .30-06 or the .30-30 conventional.
(CROSSTALK)
HORWITZ: Well, I know which one -- I mean, I know which has more power. So the .30-30 obviously has more power. But .223 goes at a higher velocity, OK? No, it's serious. And it's meant to be antipersonnel. And you can put lots of them in the cartridge at the same time.
The .223 is an antipersonnel round. I'm not going to argue with you. Rifle rounds are powerful, too. Configure the way an assault weapon and you create something that's much more lethal.
CARLSON: Today, they don't show that at all. But it's nice to have you on. Thank you for your game defense.
HORWITZ: I hope I get to be back someday.
CARLSON: Nice to see you.
HORWITZ: All right.
CARLSON: President-elect Trump is planning to face off with reporters. He tweeted about it moments ago.
Correspondent Peter Doocy is live, as he often is, outside Trump Tower in New York City.
Peter?
PETER DOOCY, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: And, Tucker, the next president has had many press availabilities where he answers a question or two on his way in or out of an event. But he has not had a full-blown press conference until now we know January 11th.
He just announced, ""I will be having a general news conference on January 11th in NYC. Thank you.""
Remember, last month, he had teased us with a press conference that was going to be time for him to stand there with his adult children and announce what he was going to do with his business interests. This is a general press conference. We don't know exactly -- we don't know anything else about it, just from the tweet. So that is one week from now. And it comes a few hours after we learned that 2017 starts with one American car company in the president-elect's good graces and one of them really not, because this morning, there was a shot on social media.
@RealDonaldTrump account said, ""General Motors is ending Mexican-made model of Chevy Cruze to U.S. car dealers tax-free across border. Make in USA or pay big border tax.
Well, GM realized they may have a problem. So they quickly responded like this. ""General Motors manufacturers of Chevrolet Cruze sedan in Lordstown, Ohio. All Chevrolet Cruze sedan sold in the U.S. are built in GM's assembly plant in Lordstown, Ohio. GM built the Chevrolet Cruze hatchback for global markets in Mexico with a small number sold in the U.S.""
Well, another American company, Ford, is actually doing something now that the president-elect called on them to do as a candidate. And that is stop building a factory in Mexico and invest more money here in the states.
Ford's CEO says the automaker is no longer going to build a new facility in Mexico instead, pumping $700 million into a Michigan factory, saving 700 jobs. Something Ford's president says was done with the next president's policies in mind.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
MARK FIELDS, FORD MOTOR COMPANY CEO & PRESIDENT: When we look at some of the tax and regulatory reforms that he has been talking about, that gives us a lot of confidence. And this is a vote of confidence that he can deliver on those things.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
DOOCY: All this action is happening, of course, before Mr. Trump has taken the oath of office. And we learned today that two of his predecessors have RSVPed for inauguration festivities. That would be George W. Bush and Bill Clinton and the person that Democrats were hoping would have their hand on the bible that day, getting sworn in, Hillary Clinton. She's going to be there on the front steps of the Capitol, too.
Tucker?
CARLSON: Peter Doocy live in Midtown, Manhattan outside Trump Tower. Thanks, Peter.
President Obama imposed sanctions on Russia recently in response to allegations that the Russian president hacked the election, as they are putting it. Not all Republicans disagree with that, in fact, some said President Obama didn't go far enough with those sanctions. That includes Arkansas Senator Tom Cotton, a member of the Senate Intelligence Armed Services Committee. He joins us now from the Russell rotunda in the U.S. Capitol.
Sir, thanks a lot for joining us.
SEN. TOM COTTON (R-AK), SENATE INTELLIGENCE ARMED SERVICES COMMITTEE: Thanks for having me, Tucker. Happy New Year to you and your viewers.
CARLSON: Thank you. Happy New Year to you. So the president imposed these sanctions and expel those 35 Russian diplomats in part because he believed and a lot of people in Washington believed, which is that Vladimir Putin weighed in in order to help President-elect Trump get elected. And yet, we are hearing now from people who would know, that that's not a certainty.
So here is the chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence yesterday said and I'm quoting, ""There is no proof we have from intelligence sources I've seen that show the Russians are directly trying to help Trump.""
Then, this morning, Jim Woolsey, the former CIA director said this morning that it's not at all clear that Russia did this. And if it did, that it acted alone.
So my question is simple, do we know enough to act in the way we have with Russia? To impose these sanctions and expel the diplomats.
COTTON: Tucker, I don't think we know enough yet about exactly what happened with the hacking of the DNC and the dissemination of those emails.
Now, I have called for a long time for us to take a firmer line with Russia. So, while I think the president took some good, initial steps last week, it's not specifically about the hacking of the DNC. It's about Russia's behavior for the last eight years.
Why did they think they can get away with doing something like hacking into the DNC? It's because President Obama has consistently looked the other way on their aggression.
Remember, just months after Russia invaded Georgia in 2008, President Obama came to office and pressed the reset button with Vladimir Putin. In the middle of his campaign in 2012, he promised the Russian president to wait after the election, he would have more flexibility. And then when Mitt Romney called Russia one of our number geopolitical adversaries, he laughed and mocked him in a debate.
All of these things are reasons why Vladimir Putin thinks he can get away with acting contrary to the U.S. interest. He ought not, Russia ought not to have hacked into the DNC. They ought to pay a price for that, a steeper price and may have.
However, if you are to make a list of Russia's crimes and transgressions against the United States and our interest over the last eight years, that would be way down the list.
CARLSON: So, I mean, I think everything you said is totally defensible. I personally agree with all of it. And yet, there is a bigger picture. So, Russia is on our side fundamentally in the struggle that most of us recognize is the main one, which is against Islamic extremism, we share a common interest.
We see this and a lot of other countries. A lot of our allies spy on us. In fact, I think they all do. Israel, Great Britain, Germany. I mean, they have all broken into our computers and spied on us, and we are still allied with them because we have common interest. And we should be. So why wouldn't Russia fall into that category?
COTTON: Well, all those other countries don't do things like beat our diplomats in Moscow, when they are walking in the front door of our embassy. They don't harass our diplomats throughout Russia and the Middle East.
They don't invade sovereign countries in Europe like Russia did in Ukraine, like they did in Georgia.
CARLSON: Right.
COTTON: They don't supply missiles to rebels that use those missiles to shoot civilian aircraft out of the skies. They don't run illegal spy rings in our countries for decades that are then exposed.
These are just all examples of things that Russia has done over the last eight years. And this is a small measure because Barack Obama has -- again, has not just appeased Russia and then weakened Russia, he is actively undermined efforts by people in Congress like me to take a firmer line.
(CROSSTALK)
CARLSON: I agree with -- I mean, I agree with all of that. And there is no question that Russia has many decades long history of causing mischief around the world and here. I would say that a lot of our allies do run illegal spy rings in our country, as you know, and we look the other way. But it doesn't answer the bigger question, though, aren't we basically on the same side as the Russians on the question of Islamic terror?
It doesn't mean ignoring or excusing their awful behavior. But doesn't that outweigh that behavior?
COTTON: Well, Tucker, I wish it were so. But if you look at what Russia has done in Syria, they have taken the fight hardly at all to the Islamic State. They fought almost entirely the Syrian opposition that was fighting Bashar al-Assad. They haven't been bombing Raqqah, the capital of the Islamic State. They have been bombing Aleppo, which is the main opposition, was the main opposition hold out until it failed last month.
It would be a good thing if Russia would work with the rest of the civilized world to counteract the threat of Islamic extremism because they have their own Islamic extremists in the (INAUDIBLE).
CARLSON: Yes.
COTTON: But they simply are not doing that in Syria. They're not doing much of it around the world, either.
CARLSON: So one of the explanations for Russia's behavior is the drop, as you know, in oil prices, which has made the country less stable, poorer, more desperate. And countries in that condition tend to act out, you see with the North Koreans.
Won't sanctions potentially exacerbate that? In other words, if Russia becomes even poorer and more cornered, the more its behavior become less predictable and more destructive?
COTTON: Well, I think the reason that Vladimir Putin has become more aggressive over the last eight years is that he doesn't have a sense of boundaries from President Obama.
You know, this goes back five years to his election as president for a third term after he had stepped aside for four years and become prime minister.
Throughout 2000, he enjoyed an oil boom and that was good for the Russian economy. But over the last five years, and his third term, he's had to whip up a nationalist frenzy in Russia.
CARLSON: Right.
COTTON: But that goes far back before the sanctions related to Ukraine. It goes back before the sanctions that President Obama imposed last week. What we need with Vladimir Putin is a new sense of boundaries. We need to impose new boundaries and we need to impose costs when he crosses those boundaries.
This is something that Ronald Reagan did. Ronald Reagan made the moral case against totalitarian communism and Soviet Union. But he also did some fundamental things to change the strategic equation like rebuilding our military, like deploying intermediate range missiles to Europe.
CARLSON: Right.
COTTON: Donald Trump promises to do those exact same things. In fact, he promised them in the campaign to rebuild our military and to upgrade our nuclear arsenal and to build missile defences. Hillary Clinton is the one that was promising policies in the campaign that actually would have emboldened Russia and given them even more strategic advantage.
CARLSON: But, I mean, Trump is out there -- I mean, Trump is out there basically saying nice things about Vladimir Putin on Twitter. As an avowed, you know, opponent of Putin, someone who thinks that sanctions should be even tougher, does that bother you?
COTTON: Well, I think Donald Trump views Russia and China and most other countries fundamentally from an American standpoint that we need to have a firmer line. We need to represent American interests. That's why he often uses the phrase, ""America First.""
CARLSON: Right.
COTTON: Ultimately -- ultimately, you often have to sit down and negotiate with your worst adversaries. And those worst adversaries are often pretty bad actors.
Ronald Reagan, after the build up and after drawing a firm line in his first administration sat down with Mikhail Gorbachev negotiated some pretty far-reaching treaties, and ultimately, that helped me to the collapse of the Soviet Union.
I think it's important to take a firm line, it's important to take a firm line with all of our adversaries. That doesn't mean in the end, though, that you can't negotiate from a position of strength, when you have genuine overlapping interest or you have something you can genuinely bargain for.
For eight years, though, Barack Obama has simply looked the other way. He tried to hold back people in the Congress who want to impose boundaries on Russia. And he's given away the shock to Russian.
CARLSON: Senator Cotton, thanks a lot for joining us. I appreciate it.
COTTON: Thanks, Tucker.
CARLSON: And now it's time for ""Twitter Storm,"" our nightly forecast of social media's most powerful weather patterns.
Tonight, the eye of the storm on Bill and Hillary Clinton who reportedly will attend the new president's inauguration later this month. The news was met with mixed reaction on Twitter.
Buckey Breeder (ph) wrote this, ""I'm so pleasantly surprise an adult behavior from the Clintons that I won't say anything snarky.""
Shocked into silence.
Roger Kempt (ph) twitted this, ""You can't win the election to be inaugurated. I guess being an spectator is second best.""
Killian (ph) wrote, ""Yuck! Why? Are there donors they can fleece? What possible good can they do? Again, yuck.""
TruthHurts tweeted, ""And I will be attending my root canal.""
Bill Perkins wrote, ""Are they sure they are invited?""
Alice R. (ph) tweeted, ""Wow, I didn't expect that. I respect people who get back up after being defeated.""
And finally Soaked Stone (ph) wrote, ""Thank you for setting the example. Maybe other Democrats will follow.""
Maybe.
That's tonight's ""Twitter Storm.""
Health care prices are spiralling out of control, of course. One former hospital head says he knows why they are shady business practices that in any other industry would qualify as fraud. We will meet him in just a minute.
CARLSON: Donald Trump has promised that as president he will repeal and replace Obamacare, and the public largely agrees that he ought to.
Many Americans have found the Affordable Care Act not so affordable after all.
Steven Weissman is a lawyer and a former president of a hospital in Miami. He's thought a lot about why going to the doctor is so expensive. He's got some ideas.
Recently, he sent the president-elect a petition suggesting what he can do about it and he joins us now.
Mr. Weissman, thanks a lot for coming.
STEVEN WEISSMAN, ATTORNEY: Thank you, Tucker. Great to be here.
CARLSON: You have written that the normal critique of health care, that there's no price transparency. It's not exactly right. Your point is there is really no pricing at all and no legitimate pricing at all. And what many health care companies are doing is practicing a species of fraud, as you said. Explain how that works.
WEISSMAN: Well, that's exactly correct, Tucker. There is actually no pricing in health care, as everybody watching the show knows, when you ask the price of any health care procedure, anything from a lab, a physician, or a hospital, you only get one answer. That is what insurance do you have?
CARLSON: Right.
WEISSMAN: And your neighbor may be paying ten times what you are paying or one-tenth of what you are paying, depending on your insurance company, and whether or not they have insurance.
Now there is no other business in the United States that I am aware of that you can get away with that kind of a business practice. I mean, if anybody walked into the grocery store and paid a dollar for a can of tuna fish and then told the -- and then the neighbor walked in and pay ten dollars, they would understand that there was something wrong.
CARLSON: Right.
WEISSMAN: Health care, according to the so-called experts, our industry experts is extremely complicated. So complicated that ordinary people apparently can't understand it. But in reality, I think they have sold the country a bill of goods and that health care is no different than any other business.
What is necessary is that there will be a legitimate pricing. Health care providers should be able to set whatever rate they want, but they've got to set the same place, the same hospital have to charge everybody the same price.
And what that does, Tucker, is a revolution in health care and a dramatic reduction in health care prices. Because first of all, networks become completely obsolete. You should be able to go on -- you go on -- you don't need a network to get a fair price. You will be able to Google the price of any procedure in United States and determine the price.
And then, health insurance should become like real insurance, like ordinary insurance that we use to.
CARLSON: Right.
WEISSMAN: Take for example, home owners insurance.
(CROSSTALK)
When your house burns down -- well, any kind of insurance. I'm just using it as an example. Home owners, but when your house burns down, and you are shopping around and you want to find some bricks and some drywall and some paint and cement, nobody says what insurance do you have. You get to the best price you can find and you buy it.
CARLSON: Right.
WEISSMAN: But right now, consumers in the United States are totally helpless. They can shop. And the so-called transparency ideas are not going to help. If you've got a ---
CARLSON: Hold on, can I stop you there?
WEISSMAN: Sure.
CARLSON: This wasn't supposed to be this way. I was there when the debate over health care happened and technology was supposed to save us from a lot of this, remember?
And Republicans promised that, too. It's going to make the system more efficient and more transparent, but that didn't happen.
WEISSMAN: Well, I will tell you what is so shocking about technology. Throughout the last several decades, for example, the utilization of hospitals has dropped because of technology because now, you can go in the morning for a gallbladder operation and you're out in the afternoon.
CARLSON: Right.
WEISSMAN: It used to be hospitalized for five, six, seven days. So, hospital utilization in the United States. Right now, the occupancy rate in hospitals is about 60 percent. 40 percent of the beds are empty. In any other industry, you would see a sale.
You should be going out on, there ought to be a price line for hospitals.
CARLSON: Well, exactly.
WEISSMAN: But the price is completely irrelevant. It's not a factor. You get a new medical practitioner, physician, comes out of medical school, opening a new practice, wants to build a thriving practice.
He is not going to go out and say, health care checkups 1995 to get some business. He can't do it. If an insurance company finds out he is charging $19.95, they're going to say, hey, we're going to cut your reimbursement rates. Medicare may kick them out because he is charging less than Medicare pays.
(LAUGHTER)
CARLSON: It is so perverse. Unfortunately, we are out of time. I have about a hundred more questions for you. Our viewers if they are interested in follow up, where can they find your petition online and read in more detail about your plan to fix this?
WEISSMAN: The petition is on change.org and it's called ""End Predatory Health Care Pricing.""
CARLSON: OK. And we're going to put it on our Facebook page right after the show.
Steven Weissman, thanks a lot for coming on. It's really interesting.
WEISSMAN: Thank you. Thank you for the opportunity. I appreciate it.
CARLSON: Thanks.
Well, one political analyst has a message to Democrats and a warning to President-elect Trump. We will hear them both coming up.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
HILLARY CLINTON (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: You could put half of Trump's supporters into what I call basket of deplorables.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You have campaign, like this with Trump's (inaudible).
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: What he has awakened in my country is bigotry and distrust.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The bigotry, the racism, the ignorance, the incitement of violence that he has been encouraging and people.
CLINTON: The racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamophobic, you name it.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
CARLSON: Well there is one thing all the smart people agree on, from (inaudible) to Bill Clinton, if Donald Trump won in November because America is a very bad place, filled with very bad people, racist, mouth readers, the entire cast of deliverance, basically. Political scientist David Paul Kuhn heard that explanation and decided to dig deeper. The result is a recent op-ed in ""The New York Times,"" the title of us has at all, ""sorry, liberals, bigotry did not elect Trump."" He joins us now, David Kuhn, great to see you.
DAVID PAUL KUHN, POLITICAL ANALYST: Thanks for having me Tucker.
CARLSON: I haven't seen my favorite was Chelsea Handler saying that Trump was so sexist she needs to move to Spain.
(LAUGHTER)
Hilarious, anyway, you looked into this really article of faith that Trump got elected because America is retro created and bigoted and you found what?
PAUL KUHN: He didn't get elected for that reason. If you, for example, take the voters, about a fifth of voters, tens of millions, do not approve of Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton. But they went overwhelmingly for Trump. Why? Because he was a challenge to the status quo that Hillary Clinton embodied. And it sort of brings up larger issues, right, because we have seen this story before, right, the Republicans would mark the White House, and the explanation that is given is that it is sexism, bigotry, it is the worst in Republican voters. But of course, that is the equivalent of, and business terms, of a company saying you are not buying our product, it has to be the consumer's fault. You don't see companies doing that. You don't see companies blaming the consumer. It is bad marketing and perhaps, a clearly bad strategy.
CARLSON: Yes, new coke failed, because Americans have no pallets.
(LAUGHTER)
Not a good answer. You make a really good point, I thought in this piece about, basically the current condition of the Democratic Party which is really weaker than many of us recognize. The Obama years, the popular as he is as a person, have been devastating to his party. And you point the finger at his abandoning his economic message early on, instead, focusing on health care.
PAUL KUHN: That is critical. Eight years ago yesterday, I wrote an essay for Real Clear Politics, basically undermining the height of Barack Obama. He remade our politics, he remade the electoral map. If you really looked at the data, his mandate, his majority support follow the stock market crash. The issue that gave him his mandate was the great recession. When did he start losing the white support that he gained, the historic white support for any Democratic since 1980? It was in the summer, as the healthcare debates began to it consumed the agenda. What happened to all those promises and those whispers in late 2008, about a new, new deal? It didn't happen. So why did Barack Obama, then, by 2010, and his party, suffer historic congressional losses? Well it is because they didn't answer the issue that brought them there. Of course, that is a shot across the bow, and a warning to Donald Trump, that he has to heed the issues that gave him the White House.
CARLSON: That is right. He got to make to go to in his economic promises. It seems like an obvious point and I think it is a correct point and a lot of smart people in the Democratic Party and yet, none of them prevailed upon Hillary to come up with an economic message. And you see that with a bunch of Democratic politicians. Why? Why wouldn't they do that?
PAUL KUHN: It's not the making of a modern Democratic president with identity politics, appeal to enough Hispanic, and enough African-American voters, enough Norwegian bicyclists, and you will be the president of the United States, because the demographics are on your side. The problem is, for all of the hype about political machinations and about Geo TV efforts and data on your iPhone, that can find a voter, you know at the bar across the street, the fact is, if you don't have a good message, you don't have an inspiring candidate, and you are not going to inspire voters. That is fundamentally is what explains, for example, why African-American turnout went down and the 2016 race. Why, for example, the white working class on the opposite end of the spectrum effectively, in droves, left the party that long left them.
CARLSON: Yes. I don't think there is any question to Hillary got the overwhelming majority of Norwegian bicyclists. I haven't check, but I am pretty sure that is right. David Paul Kuhn, thank a lot. That was really smart.
PAUL KUHN: Thank you Tucker.
CARLSON: Good to see you.
Well if it wasn't Trump's races supporters, it must have been the Clinton campaign emails released by WikiLeaks. That is the explanation of the week. My colleague, Sean Hannity, interviewed Julian Assange. She is the founder of WikiLeaks of course. That interview airs tonight at 10:00 p.m. Eastern. Here's what he told him about the effect of those leaks on the election. Watch.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
SEAN HANNITY, FOX NEWS HOST: Did it change the outcome? Who knows? It is absolutely impossible to tell. But if it did, if it did, the accusation is that the true statements of Hillary Clinton as her campaign manager, John Podesta, and the DNC, they are true statements. This would change the election.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
CARLSON: There is a lot of news in that interview. Sean went all the way to London to do it. You can see it tonight, a couple hours from now, 10:00 p.m. ""Hannity,"" it is worth it.
And one of the fiercest anti-Putin activists, chess master Garry Kasparov is here next. He says he knows what the real problem is between Russia and the U.S.
CARLSON: The White House has imposed sanctions on the Russians for allegedly meddling in our election. But our next guest Garry Kasparov says the U.S. doesn't have a problem with Russia, we have a problem with Putin. Kasparov is whet he used to call a man of parts. He is one of the greatest chess players, literally, in the history of the game. He is the chairman of the human rights foundation, the author of a new book called ""Winter is coming- Vladimir Putin and the enemies of the free world must be stop,"" a self-explanatory title and he joins us now, Garry, it is great to see you.
GARRY KASPAROV, FAMOUS CHESS PLAYER IN HISTORY: Thanks for inviting me.
CARLSON: So I respect the work that you do, writing for democracy in Russia, I think it is worthy, I understand why as a Russian you are very upset about the autocracy of Vladimir Putin. My question is, as an American, why should I be as concerned? Why should I see Russia as a threat to the United States?
KASPAROV: Well you have to see Russia as with United States, Putin's Russia, because it harms America worldwide. Eventually, you are now experiencing some of Putin's meddling here in the United States. Hacking into American political systems, it sends a signal to your allies and for the like in the world, that America is weak. We cannot protect it on its own borders.
CARLSON: John Podesta's email is not the same as our political system.
KASPAROV: No, no, no, Tucker, we are talking about perception becoming reality. You know people worldwide in Europe, in Asia, in Latin America, Africa. They don't understand the difference in DNC, John Podesta's email. All they know is that Vladimir Putin's operation somehow meddled interfere in American elections. And they also understand that, you know for many years, America, under Barack Obama, refrain from addressing these issues, addressing this threat, and the retaliation was too little and too late.
CARLSON: So, the real cost is that in the eyes of people in Gambia and Burma and Benares Aires, we are weak? I am not making light of it.
KASPAROV: Don't try my geography. The problem is not Gambia or Benares Aires. The problem is France, Germany, United Kingdom, Baltic's, and Eastern Europe, Turkey. You know the price of America -- America will pay for an attempt to walk away will be huge. It is Obama's foreign policy was a failure. Senator caught in few minutes ago described all of these actions against U.S. interest had Putin conducted and he deserved, of course to be punished months earlier. The problem is, if you try to reward Putin with a grand bargain deal, that is what we can America dramatically. You cannot abandon its values worldwide.
CARLSON: But we pursued our values pretty vigorously over the past 15 years, and wound up in Iraq and Afghanistan, causing untold harm and Libya and didn't really do much for the rest of the Middle East. Maybe we should acknowledge that Russia is primarily a threat to Europe, it always has been, perhaps, the European countries ought to be the frontline of the defense there and not the United States. Why is that a crazy idea?
KASPAROV: Look, you know, are you saying that America should walk away from NATO in the state of (inaudible)?
CARLSON: NATO has been around since 1949, why not reassess that?
KASPAROV: What you are saying now is exactly the reassessment? That is what makes people in the Baltic's and Eastern Europe as a whole, and the Scandinavian countries, freaking out.
CARLSON: I get it. I would be worried, too. But as the father of a 19- year-old son, can you explain to me why it is in my interest to send him potentially to go defend the Baltic's, nothing against the Baltic's. Isn't that sort of the job of (inaudible)?
KASPAROV: In 1938, Neville Chamberlain also talked about protecting countries that they couldn't find on the map. Today, the geography is much better. America played its leading role since 1945. It's offended not only its own borders but also, the free world. Today, I am hearing, from the new administration, it is a new era where America could walk away, ignoring strategic interests of the free world.
CARLSON: I am just interested. We could debate this forever, but just a really simple final question. Where this obligation of the United States does has uniquely among the nations?
KASPAROV: If you have no obligations.
CARLSON: Where did that come from? It that from god or where does that come from?
KASPAROV: It is from American exceptionalism. Should I tell you again? America became the United States. America became great because it defended its values in the first place. If you want to abandon your global view, you need to abandon the global economy. Most of Americans are multinational corporations. They benefit dramatically from the global trade and by the way, so do American customers.
CARLSON: Chinese is benefiting a lot from global trade.
(CROSSTALK)
KASPAROV: Try to impose tariffs on China, then, wait for the next election actions when all the prices will go up.
CARLSON: That is a separate debate, but an interesting one. I hope you will come back to that, Garry Kasparov a really amazing guy, actually, great to see you, even if I disagree. Thanks.
KASPAROV: Thank you.
CARLSON: Those Amazon echo devices are supposed to make your life easier. But do they? One family learned at a costly lesson from one. We will tell you what it was next. Plus, Leland Vittert, the great Leland Vittert, ladies and gentlemen steps into the friend zone, he is here. We will be right back.
CARLSON: Here is something new. One Texas family is paying a pretty high price for the ease of technology, thanks to Amazon's Alexa voice assistant. A 6-year-old girl was asking Alexa about cookies and a dollhouse, of course she was, through the families echoed out, a device of some kind. But Alexa mistook the chatter for an actual order and took the liberty of selecting a hundred $170 dollhouse and 4 pounds of cookies, could be a glimpse of the future to come. Pretty soon, Alexa may not even ask your permission, she will take your credit card and order what she wants, cutting out the middleman entirely. I look forward to that.
Time now for ""The friend zone."" after an intense show, we like to bring on fun people, good people our friend in the building here on Fox, the correspondent Leland Vittert, it is great to see you.
LELAND VITTERT, FOX NEWS HOST: Nice to see you, Tucker. I was thinking about this invitation, Fox has sent me to war zones. They sent me to Libya, Egypt, Israel, they sent me to Baltimore basically a war zone, Washington a war zone by the other name, this is the first time I am nervous. I have never been to a ""The Friend Zone"" before.
(LAUGHTER)
CARLSON: Well it is always friendly fire to get in. I have some tough questions for you, Leland. No, actually, a lot of viewers may not know you spent many years abroad in Israel for us at Fox. Among the coolest things you did, I think, you interviewed a failed suicide bomber.
VITTERT: What you would think would be a contradiction in terms way. They do exist. This young woman had come back, there she is. She had failed in her suicide bomb, because the bomb didn't go off. She then went back to Gaza and a prisoner exchange. We got a hold of the video of her trying to blow herself up, we thought, wouldn't this be interesting to find someone who failed as a suicide bomber, perhaps she had changed her ways and saw the light even it and decided she was going to try keep people from being suicide bombers. We want to interview her. She said just the opposite. She said if I watch the video, it brings me back to when I was going to find paradise. I want to be a suicide bomber again and probably is not going to happen for her, because Israelis now know who she is, they won't let her back into Israel. But then, she started talking about her dreams, which is to inspire more suicide bombers, number one. Number two, she wanted to go and be a journalist inside of Gaza. There are a lot of journalists who inspire suicide bombers inside of Gaza, so that might work. At the end of the conversation, she said to my interpreter, you should tell him, the next time he comes back to Gaza, to let me know, I would like to get together.
CARLSON: What do you mean get together?
VITTERT: Well have a coca-cola. They don't have drinks there. At that moment, when I saw that interaction, if you watch her and look at her, she looks like any other normal young woman, you take off her hijab. She looks like any normal woman walking on the street. You thought here is somebody who wants to go kill as many people as you can. Here is the essence of evil, and yet, she is like any other normal young woman and so many ways. It is struck back to what you learned about the holocaust, the banality of evil. I realized, gee, if this is the enemy that we now face, it is going to be awfully difficult.
CARLSON: Do you think she was a relief that the bomb didn't go off?
VITTERT: I asked her that and she said, no. She said that she wished it had gone off. I showed her the video. I don't know if we have it, where she pulled the trigger. She was watching it, we were watching it, I said, what were you thinking right then? She said that is when I began to taste paradise. They had brainwashed her to believe that.
CARLSON: But she still believed it even after she survived.
VITTERT: Absolutely.
CARLSON: It really is a death hope. I interviewed a lot of people and I've never interviewed a failed suicide bomber. That is fascinating.
VITTERT: You need experienced.
CARLSON: Leland Vittert has been around. Thanks a lot for joining us.
VITTERT: Good to see you.
CARLSON: Great to see you. Coming up, ready to take your criticism, you send a lot of savagely cruel tweets to @tuckercarlson. We will read the meanest coming up.
CARLSON: It is pretty easy to become egomaniac here in cable news, with all the groupies and everything. So to temper that temptation, we have a segment we call ""Mean tweets"" to bring us down to earth. You sent a bunch this week. Steve Tim tweeted this, I hate your new hairstyle, have Bret Bayer messed it up before every show. As if he doesn't already.
TomMaker said, quit letting your dog cut your hair.
And (inaudible) tweeted, Tucker Carlson is the very worst, glad he still has a show, he might be the dumbest person in the media and that sends something. There is an exclamation point on that, by the way.
James said this, not promoting violence, but after watching intellectual bullying and word twisting by Tucker Carlson, decided he has a very punchable face.
Well, thank you. And finally MattNeo wrote this, you are working or still in vacation? You just started a job a month ago, busted. You are right. I needed that.
Tomorrow, it is your turn to be king for a day, if you had absolute power and you could do one thing to improve this country, what would it be? We always get interesting ones on this one. Tweet us, @Tuckercarlson, email tuckercarlsontonight@foxnews.com That is it for us. Tune in every night at seven for the show if that is a sworn enemy of lying, pomposity, smugness, and groupthink. Don't forget to DVR it if you haven't already. ""The O'Reilly Factor"" is next, and then, the ""Hannity"" interview is live at 10:00 with Juliann Assange. Stay tuned."
0	50	 51 von 72	Fox News Network	January 3, 2017 Tuesday	 FOX SPECIAL REPORT WITH BRET BAIER	 6:00 PM EST		"BRET BAIER, FOX NEWS CHIEF POLITICAL ANCHOR: A rocky start to the new Congress and a possible preview of what's to come with the new administration as House Republicans back down following a showdown with the President-Elect.
This is SPECIAL REPORT.
Good evening. Welcome to Washington. I am Bret Baier.
It was anything but regular order at the start of the 115th session of Congress. Today the House majority scrapped plans to gut an independent ethics panel after President-Elect Donald Trump sent out a couple of tweets aimed at his own party.
The about-face by House Republicans came less than 24 hours after a closed- door meeting to adopt the measure. 
Chief congressional correspondent Mike Emanuel is on Capitol Hill tonight where it was more than just pomp and circumstance today on the first day of the new Congress. Good evening -- Mike.
MIKE EMANUEL, FOX NEWS CHIEF CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Bret -- good evening.
The 115th Congress is up and running but there was some drama after President-Elect Trump criticized an early move by House Republicans.
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
EMANUEL: Last night behind closed doors, Republican lawmakers voted to reform the outside Office of Congressional Ethics as it considered its rules for the new Congress.
This morning Republican Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy was forced to defend a move he opposed.
REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA), MAJORITY LEADER: First of all, it doesn't get dissolved. So I am not in favor of dissolving it.
I was not in favor of moving forward in the rules package with it because I thought we should take it by itself in a bipartisan manner because there are people on both sides of the aisle that would support these reforms. The Ethics Committee will still be there.
EMANUEL: But the real trouble came this morning when President-Elect Trump flexed some muscle on Twitter. Quote, ""With all that Congress has to work on, do they really have to make the weakening of the independent ethics watchdog as unfair as it may be, their number one act in priority? Focus on tax reform, healthcare and so many other things of far greater importance. #DTS""
Shortly before gaveling in at noon, House Republicans reversed themselves, dropping plans for now on modifying the independent ethics panel.
The Office of Congressional Ethics investigated California Democrat Congresswoman Maxine Waters who was ultimately cleared by the House Ethics Committee after a three-year investigation and a $1 million legal bill for taxpayers.
Some GOP members called it an unforced error in terms of timing, especially since Democrats have complaints about that outside group.
REP. CHARLIE DENT (R), PENNSYLVANIA: There are members who believe there are needed revisions. I'd say it's a bipartisan agreement. There need to be some changes.
As I said last night, I voted against this particular amendment because of the oversight language that I thought was a bit ambiguous and needed further clarification.
EMANUEL: Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi pounced saying quote, ""Reversing their plans to destroy the Office of Congressional Ethics will not obscure their clear contempt for ethics in the People's House. Once again the American people have seen the toxic dysfunction of a Republican House that will do anything to further their special interest agenda for transparency and undermine the public trust.""
There was no drama on the vote for House Speaker with Paul Ryan being reelected as expected. He told members this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.
REP. PAUL RYAN (R-WI), HOUSE SPEAKER: The people have given us unified government, and it wasn't because they were feeling generous. It was because they want results.
(END VIDEOTAPE)
EMANUEL: In terms of delivering results, Republicans are getting started on repealing Obamacare in a hurry. Vice President-Elect Mike Pence is due up here tomorrow. At the same time President Obama will be meeting with Democrats about trying to save it -- Bret.
BAIER: Mike Emanuel, live on Capitol Hill. Mike -- thank you.
The President-Elect spent the day in New York, putting the finishing touches on his cabinet and once again calling out big business with 140 characters.
Correspondent Peter Doocy reports from New York tonight on Trump's latest moves.
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
PETER DOOCY, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: The President-Elect showed again today he has no problem making an example out of an American company he thinks is trying to make money here off products made elsewhere. @RealDonaldTrump tweeted quote, ""General Motors is sending Mexican-made model of Chevy Cruze to U.S. car dealers tax-free across border. Make in U.S.A. or pay big border tax.""
Tweets like that have moved markets in the past. Just ask Boeing and Lockheed Martin who eventually adjusted costs that's meant for major projects under pressure by the President-Elect.
So GM quickly responded like this. Quote, ""General Motors manufacturers the Chevrolet Cruze sedan in Lordstown, Ohio. All Chevrolet Cruze sedans sold in the U.S. are built in GM's assembly plant in Lordstown, Ohio. GM builds the Chevrolet Cruze hatchback for global markets in Mexico with a small number sold in the U.S.""
But GM didn't mention there the Lordstown, Ohio plant they are touting as a defense is about to lose about a thousand jobs because gas is cheap, people aren't clamoring for fuel-efficient cars.
And while one American car company was being criticized by the next Commander-in-Chief, another was being praised. Ford announced it's not going forward with the new plant in Mexico and has instead chosen to invest $700 million in a Michigan facility -- something candidate Trump said he was hoping would happen.
DONALD TRUMP (R), U.S. PRESIDENT-ELECT: You look at what Ford is doing. They are building billions of dollars worth of plants in Mexico. I want them to build the plants in the United States.
DOOCY: This move saved about 700 jobs in the states. And the company's CEO says this was a business-first decision but he admits executives in the boardroom at Ford HQ have been paying attention to what Mr. Trump has said on the trail.
MARK FIELDS, FORD MOTORS COMPANY CEO: When we look at some of the tax and regulatory reforms that he's been talking about, that gives us a lot of confidence. And this is a vote of confidence that he can deliver on those things.
DOOCY: The promise of better trade deals helped Trump gain steam during the primaries. And he's announced he wants Reagan administration veteran Robert Lighthizer to be U.S. trade rep, a cabinet level job in an administration led by someone attempting to stimulate economic growth in a way no president ever has before.
BOB CUSACK, ""THE HILL"": I have never seen a president in the modern era go after specific companies like Donald Trump has and really trying to embarrass them into getting some changes which he has been able to do. So I don't think -- I mean I think this is without precedent.
(END VIDEOTAPE)
DOOCY: And news is breaking tonight that someone Mr. Trump has fired before on ""The Apprentice"" may soon be hired for a job at his White House. Omarosa Manigault is being considered for a position in the Trump administration. She was one of his earliest and most enthusiastic celebrity endorsers -- Bret.
BAIER: Peter Doocy, outside Trump Tower. Peter -- thank you.
U.S. manufacturing activity hit a two-year high in December, showing a positive sign for economic growth. The Institute for Supply Management says its manufacturing index came in at 54.7 last month, the highest readings since the end of 2014. Any reading over 50 signals growth.
The markets ended the day in the green today. The Dow was up 119, just shy of that elusive 20,000 mark. The S&P 500 rose 19. The Nasdaq finished ahead 46.
So will the Dow hit the 20,000 mark this week? Liz Claman, host of Fox Business Network's ""COUNTDOWN TO THE CLOSING BELL"" joins me now with a look at the numbers. Good evening, Liz.
What did today's tone with that market set?
(CROSSTALK)
LIZ CLAMAN, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK: Well, it kind of gave us a scare, actually. At one point, Bret, we were up 176 points. Then we lost nearly all of the gains and then as you saw, we ended with a pretty sizable move to the upside of about 119 points.
But in between, a lot of people were saying wait a minutes, wait a minute. As January goes, so goes the rest of the year. That is an old saying that I want your viewers to forget. Why? Because it used to be that you could divine how the entire stock market would perform over the entire year simply by looking at the first five days of January.
Last year completely blew that theory to smithereens because January endured a jaw-dropping 5.5 percent loss and then what did we see? Had you sold on that, thinking that that would sort of color the rest of the year, you would've missed out on major gains. The Dow ended up adding about 13 percent. And even the small and mid caps saw a 20 percent gain which was just a great performance for all of 2016.
So you don't want to do that and look at those market voodoo numbers. What do you want to do? You really have to look at the moment with all we've got. And that is some serious optimism coming from a Trump presidency. It's just about 17 days away from the inauguration. Already we have seen incredible returns for the markets on the belief that Donald Trump will be very business-positive simply by cutting taxes. He will slice regulations. This is what he said he will do and, of course, instituting a pretty big infrastructure spending plan.
All of those things together give people optimism and it does tend to have a pretty decent velocity effect. So perhaps that's what we go on at the moment. And sure enough when you look at something like the Wilshire 5000, which is sort of a bigger index than the S&P 500. Since Donald Trump was elected, the day after, November 9 it added $1.7 trillion to the index. So, you know, you go with that, it looks pretty good.
BAIER: Yes. And quickly Liz, you know, you look at the pro-growth focus that the markets are looking at with the Trump administration. And yet, it might not be great for all stocks. We just heard from Peter's report. He took on General Motors, he's hit other companies before for the big jobs off shore.
What does this say about the power of the President-Elect's tweets and their effects on the market?
CLAMAN: Major power. And you saw it today as Peter articulated. You know, he took on General Motors. He wants any cars that are made south of the border that are coming back into the U.S. from American companies -- he says too bad, folks. You don't get a free ride there. You've got to pay a border tax.
Initially General Motors started to fall and then it managed to eke out just under 1 percent gain. But we have seen other stocks like United Technologies, the parent of Carrier, before it sort of found the Trump religion and promised to bring these jobs back to the U.S. You saw those stocks start to falter. There is huge power in what Donald Trump is able to do when he takes on those companies.
You can bet other companies are kind of ducking and covering. Ford, of course, said don't worry, we are not going to open that plant in Mexico. But there are many, many companies, Bret, that have operations elsewhere that are based in the U.S. and can you take on each one? It's going to be very hard.
BAIER: Well, they're all definitely following Real Donald Trump. We can guarantee that. Liz -- thank you.
Another forceful response today from the controversial head of WikiLeaks who says the Obama administration is connecting dots where there aren't any.
Chief intelligence correspondent Catherine Herridge reports tonight on a new round of finger-pointing in the hacks of political figures around the election being blamed on the Russian government.
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
CATHERINE HERRIDGE, FOX NEWS CHIEF INTELLIGENCE CORRESPONDENT: In an exclusive interview, the head of WikiLeaks told Fox's Sean Hannity that the Russian government was not his source for the DNC and Clinton campaign e- mails.
SEAN HANNITY, FOX NEWS HOST: Can you tell the American people a thousand percent you did not get it from Russia or anybody associated with Russia?
JULIAN ASSANGE, WIKILEAKS: We can say -- and we have said repeatedly over the last few months, that our source is not the Russian government. And it is not states parties.
HERRIDGE: Assange, who sought refuge in London's Ecuadorian embassy four years ago to avoid extradition on sexual assault allegations, said President Obama is not being straight with the American people.
ASSANGE: He is acting like a lawyer. If you look at most of his statements, he doesn't say that. He doesn't say WikiLeaks obtained its information from Russia, worked with Russia.
HERRIDGE: On this recent analysis released by the Bureau and Homeland Security, or DHS blaming the Russian civilian and military intelligence services, Assange said the public evidence is weak.
ASSANGE: What was missing from all of those statements, the word ""WikiLeaks"". This is very strange.
SEN. RON JOHNSON (R), WISCONSIN: And we're still waiting to be briefed by the FBI and DHS --
HERRIDGE: While the chairman of the Senate Homeland Security Committee wants more information on the Russian government connections, he has no doubts about Moscow's aggressive activities in cyber space. Last week Homeland Security declassified this map showing infrastructure like the power grid in 60 countries has been co-opted by Moscow's intelligence services.
JOHNSON: We suspect that Russia might potentially have malware in different systems.
HERRIDGE: On Friday, the ""Washington Post"" reported that a Vermont power grid was breached by Russian hackers. But over the weekend the story was corrected. A laptop that was not attached to the grid contained malicious code linked to the Russian operations.
In a recent telephone interview from his Romanian jail cell, the hacker who first exposed Hillary Clinton's use of a private email for government business said the allegations are overblown because of Cold War sensitivities.
MARCEL LAZAR LEHEL, ROMANIAN HACKER: Americans are crazy about the Russians thing and -- ok, now the Russians are invading the United States. It's crazy, I mean. It's like, I don't know. It's this hysteria, you know?
(END VIDEOTAPE)
HERRIDGE: CIA director John Brennan tonight cast doubt on the claims made by Julian Assange telling PBS that the report requested by the President will explain exactly what happened. That intelligence report could be ready as early as this week and based on our reporting, there's a real desire to make parts of the report public to answer lingering questions and to silence critics -- Bret.
BAIER: Ok. Catherine -- thank you.
HERRIDGE: You're welcome.
The White House continues to stand by the intelligence community in blaming Russia over the election-related hacks and the punishment the administration doled out. But critics wonder what made the Obama administration finally move on sanctions when it barely reacted to a hack on more than 20 million government employees that was linked directly to China.
Correspondent Kevin Corke has some answers tonight from the White House.
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
KEVIN CORKE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Materially different, that is how White House officials described allegations of hacking conducted by the Chinese and Russian governments. A distinction that guided the Obama administration's very public rebuke of Russia for its alleged meddling in the run-up to the 2016 election and it's almost muted response to the Chinese OPM hack that compromised the private information of tens of millions of Americans.
JOSH EARNEST, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: I'm not suggesting that somehow that's not important. What I am just saying is that it is materially different than the kind of hack and leak strategy that we saw the Russians engage in to try to influence our democracy.
CORKE: To suggest the U.S. responses were in contrast would be an understatement. This time the administration expelled operatives, shut down facilities, issued a report to Congress and made direct contact with Vladimir Putin.
BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: What we can also do is to, on a bilateral basis, warn other countries against these kinds of attacks. And we have done that in the past.
CORKE: Indeed, experts suggest the U.S. strategy for China was a year's long series of diplomatic and legal efforts, a far cry from the decision to publicly humiliate Moscow.
PETER BROOKES, HERITAGE FOUNDATION: There's issues of legacy, there's optics that are critically important to be able to back up their assertions about the Russian cyber operations against American political entities.
CORKE: And while there have been conflicting reports about Russia's involvement in the hacks, analysts believe the White House had little choice but to make an example out of the Kremlin.
JOHN BOLTON, FORMER U.S. AMBASSADOR TO THE U.N.: The notion that you have to wait for absolute proof about something before you act is a bad formula to use in international relations. You never have absolute proof. And if you are simply waiting for more information, more intelligence, you are letting events dictate your policy rather than you dictating it.
(END VIDEOTAPE)
CORKE: Bret -- senior administration officials say the crux of their argument is simply this. While the Chinese stole for intelligence gathering, the Russians tried to weaponize the use of that data to influence the U.S. election. And they quickly add that the U.S. response, Bret, is not over yet -- Bret.
BAIER: Kevin Corke, live on the north lawn. Kevin -- thank you.
The false reporting by the ""Washington Post"" mentioned in Catherine Herridge story over the possibility that Russia hacked into our electrical grid raises questions about the media's quest for more examples of Russia hacking that dealt with Vermont.
Fox News media analyst and host of Fox's ""MEDIA BUZZ"" Howard Kurtz is here with whether the story was founded or whether it's really a case of media hysteria on this issue. Good evening -- Howard.
HOWARD KURTZ, FOX NEWS MEDIA ANALYST: good evening -- Bret.
BAIER: How did it all come to pass?
KURTZ: Well, the ""Washington Post"" ran a dramatic headline last Friday. ""Russian hackers penetrated U.S. electricity grid through a utility in Vermont"" -- U.S. officials say the paper said the discovery of a computer code associated with Russian hackers of this utility reflected a potentially serious vulnerability for America's electric grid.
Democratic Senator Pat Lahey called it a direct threat to Vermont but the story quickly began short-circuiting.
BAIER: Did the ""Post"" acknowledge problems with the story?
KURTZ: Slowly. 90 minutes after the piece was posted online the utility said, as we just heard, only a single line of so-called malware was found at one laptop not connected to the Burlington grid. The ""Post"" which should have waited for the utility's response, softened its headline to say there was only a risk to the grid.
The next day, Bret, the newspaper acknowledged in an editor's note that the original story incorrectly said that Russian hackers had penetrated the U.S. electric grid which brings us to the ""Washington Post"" story today that essentially amounts to a complete retraction.
BAIER: Yes. So how much of the original story will be all there (ph)?
KURTZ: Here's the headline. Russian government hackers do not appear to have targeted a Vermont utility say people close to the investigation. In fact, the paper said that line of suspicious code may even have been benign. In other words, every key element of the first story was wrong. And some media outlets have pounced on the ""Post"" with ""Forbes Magazine"" calling the story fake news.
A spokeswoman told me today the paper has no comment.
BAIER: Ok. Howie -- thank you.
Donald Trump's former presidential rival will be in attendance at his inauguration later this month. Aides to Hillary and Bill Clinton confirmed the couple will be there on January 20th. Also attending will be former President George W. Bush and former first lady Laura Bush, former President Jimmy Carter will be there too but we are told former President George H.W. Bush will not attend due to health reasons.
Up next, the fight for Utah land and the steep climb facing critics of what they say was a land grab by the Obama administration. We'll explain.
First, here's what some of our Fox affiliates around the country are covering tonight.
Fox 13 in Salt Lake City where a security camera captures a two-year-old boy rescuing his twin brother after a dresser fell over on the toddler. The twins' parents say they were upstairs when the incident happened and did not discover that one of the boys had been trapped until reviewing the camera footage. Despite their son being ok, the parents say they have posted the video online to remind others of the dangers of not securing furniture to the wall.
Fox 6 in Birmingham, Alabama where a possible tornado caused four out of five weather-related deaths in the southeast. Severe storms swept across Alabama, Georgia and into the Florida panhandle where a man died in flooding.
And this is a live look from our affiliate in Atlanta, Fox 5. The big story there tonight, state legislature's plan to ban adults from smoking in a car when children are present. State Representative Sandra Scott has pre-filed legislation for the ban that could be taken up as early as next week. Representative Scott says she knows such a law would be difficult to enforce but said the goal is about education.
That's tonight's live look outside the Beltway from SPECIAL REPORT. We'll be right back.
BAIER: Utah's attorney general is promising a fight over land designated a national monument last week by President Obama. The AG there says a lawsuit is already in the works over the 1.3 million acres in the southeastern part of the state.
National correspondent William La Jeunesse reports tonight on the controversy over Bears Ears.
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This canyon is a little ruins site.
WILLIAM LA JEUNESSE, FOX NEWS NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Indian ruins and one of a kind rock art -- just two reasons why President Obama recently set aside more than a million acres in Utah as the Bears Ears National Monument -- a designation already under attack.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: He ignored us. They continue to ignore us.
LA JEUNESSE: Hundreds of Utah residents recently rallied against the monument calling it a land grab to satisfy the President's environmental allies while restricting access, grazing, and development.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We will have a comment when we actually file the lawsuit.
LA JEUNESSE: So you are going to file one?
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We're planning on filing a lawsuit.
LA JEUNESSE: But Utah's new attorney general faces a daunting challenge. The courts have never reduced the President's authority on the Antiquities Act.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I think to be fair the case would have to go to the Supreme Court of the United States.
LA JEUNESSE: Previous attempts to unwind national monument declarations have failed including lawsuits challenging President Clinton's designation of 1.7 million acres in Utah in 1996.
Bears Ears is smaller but contains unique artifacts.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: He's just in a class all of his own if you compare to other rock art around here.
LA JEUNESSE: Critics admit these Indian petroglyphs deserve protection but feel the area being protected goes beyond the scope of the law.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We hope Trump can do something to repeal this thing.
LA JEUNESSE: The new Utah claim is unusual. It comes with the governor's support and a new president not beholden to tradition.
WILLIAM PERRY PENDLEY, MOUNTAIN STATES LEGAL FOUNDATION: I think we are in a new day. And if the attorney general of Utah sues or if the Nevada attorney general sues, I think they're going to get a different response from the President of the United States and Attorney General Sessions.
(END VIDEOTAPE)
LA JEUNESSE: The proclamation does remove the land from oil and gas development. But opponents argue that any monument should require congressional approval as well as the state where it is located -- Bret.
BAIER: William -- thank you.
The President-Elect's challenge to Chicago's Democratic Mayor Rahm Emanuel to ask for help put another spotlight on that city plagued with violence. The New Year got off to a violent start with more than 40 people shot over the holiday weekend.
Tonight correspondent Matt Finn reports from Chicago on the problems facing the city's police department.
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
MATT FINN, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: President-Elect Donald Trump is taking on Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel over the city's record-violence. Trump tweeting ""Chicago murder rate is record-setting; 4,331 shooting victims with 762 murders in 2016. If mayor can't do it, he must ask for federal help.""
This just week's after the liberal Democratic Mayor Emanuel met with the President-Elect at Trump Tower. Emanuel's spokesperson replying to Trump's tweet saying in part quote, ""As the President-Elect knows from his conversation with the mayor, we agree that federal government has a strong role to play in public safety.""
In 2016 more people were killed in Chicago than New York and L.A. combined. The highest figures in two decades.
FATHER MICHAEL PFLEGER, ACTIVIST: This is a Chicago problem.
FINN: Father Michael Pfleger has led Chicago's African-American community in its fight back against crime.
PFLEGER: If they're going to band-aid (ph), we're going to continue to see carnage on our streets.
FINN: Pfleger says he reached out to Trump during the 2016 campaign but didn't hear back. He agrees that Chicago needs federal funding.
PFLEGER: When there is a fire in America, when there's a hurricane, when there's a tornado in call, they call a state of emergency. Federal funds come in and help rebuild that town, rebuild that community.
Well, we have a state of emergency in Chicago.
FINN: In the crowd, at Pfleger's march, his ally civil rights leader Reverend Jesse Jackson calling for a White House conference on violence.
Chicago's crime problem is complex. Illegal guns, gang battles over turf and cheap narcotics, the city's exclusive agreement with the ACLU that ended stop and frisk and low police morale among accusations of racism and brutality. The city's top cop says it's time to get tough.
EDDIE JOHNSON, CHICAGO POLICE SUPERINTENDENT: If you do pick up a gun and you use it, you will be held accountable. Right now we don't do that.
(END VIDEOTAPE)
FINN: Heavily criticized, Mayor Rahm Emanuel recently cleared the funding to add 1,000 new officers to the streets of Chicago. CPD is under investigation by the Department of Justice for misconduct and the entire city awaits its ruling -- Bret.
BAIER: Matt Finn in Chicago. Matt -- thank you.
President-Elect Donald Trump has called the United Nations a waste of time and money and nothing more than a club for people to hang out. Today the U.N.'s new Secretary-General says he isn't concerned about the President- Elect remarks. Antonio Gutierrez said today he is focused on getting countries to come together to solve the problems the world is facing including terrorism, human rights violations, poverty, and inequality.
One of the many challenges the President-Elect will confront as soon as he is sworn in on January 20th, and by many accounts the most dangerous, is North Korea's accelerating drive towards a nuclear weapon and nuclear weapons capability on top of an ICBM -- an intercontinental ballistic missile.
Yet, as chief Washington correspondent, James Rosen reports from the State Department, the President-Elect is hardly waiting until January 20th to let Pyongyang knows where he stands on this issue.
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
JAMES ROSEN, FOX NEWS CHIEF WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT: In his New Year's Day address on state run TV, North Korean dictator Kim Jong-Un delivered the usual broadsides at America.
KIM JONG-UN, NORTH KOREA DICTATOR (through translator): We should terminate meddling of the United States and other foreign powers who aim for an Asian-Pacific invasion by controlling South Korea.
ROSEN: More worrisome to U.S. officials however was Kim's claim to have reached the final stages of testing for an intercontinental ballistic missile or ICBM. If true, it would mean the Stalinist regime in Pyongyang which conducted two underground nuclear tests last year would soon be able to strike the mainland U.S. with a rocket capable of carrying a miniaturized nuclear warhead.
FRED FLEITZ, CENTER FOR SECURITY POLICY: I believe North Korea could fire a missile that could hit the United States today, and I mean at least the West Coast of the United States, with a rocket that qualifies as an ICBM.
However, North Korea probably has not perfected the technology for a reentry vehicle for the warhead and the technology for a guidance system.
ROSEN: At the State Department, officials declined to say whether Kim was bluffing about long-range missiles but did assess his progress on warheads.
JOHN KIRBY, STATE DEPARTMENT SPOKESMAN: We do not believe that he at this point in time has the capability to tip one of these with a nuclear warhead.
ROSEN: At the Pentagon, officials acknowledge that America's own missile defense systems designed to shoot down an ICBM carrying a nuclear weapon last tested successfully in 2014.
PETER COOK, PEWNTAGON SPOKESMAN: Given all of the aspects of our broader missile defense system, our layered system, we feel confident in our ability to deter this threat and protect American citizens.
ROSEN: President-Elect Trump greeted Kim's claims with one of his laser- focused tweets, writing Monday, ""North Korea just stated that it is in the final stages of developing a nuclear weapon capable of reaching parts of the U.S. It won't happen,"" unquote.
(END VIDEOTAPE)
ROSEN: And Mr. Trump followed up that tweet with another in which he criticized China for refusing to rein in the nuclear ambitions of its client state in Pyongyang. The Chinese foreign ministry today denied doing nothing on the North Korean account and called on all sides to avoid aggravating the issue. Bret?
BAIER: James Rosen live at the State Department. James, thank you.
There is frightening new video tonight showing the face of the suspected killer of 39 people at a Turkish nightclub over the New Year. At least 14 people have been detained so far in connection with that attack, but the killer remains at large. Correspondent John Huddy reports on the hunt for an assassin.
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
JOHN HUDDY, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: In a 44-second recording of what appears to be a selfie video, the suspected gunman responsible for the New Year's day massacre in Turkey is seen circling Taksim Square in Istanbul with a menacing look. Turkish police have not confirmed the authenticity of the video. It was run by Turkish state television and other media outlets. But tonight we are learning more details about the attack and the ongoing investigation.
Police reportedly know who the killer is, having used his fingerprints, pictures, and video to I.D. him, including this surveillance video from the entrance of the nightclub where the New Year's party turned into a nightmare.
The cheers and celebration became screams and cries for help early Sunday morning when the killer stormed the nightclub, and according to Turkish police, unloaded 180 rounds into the crowd. ISIS claimed responsibility for the attack, calling the gunman a soldier of the caliphate. Turkish officials described him as a highly professional assassin. His name is still unknown.
Today hundreds of people marched outside the nightclub condemning the violence and, like this man, saying they will not surrender to ISIS. Of the 39 people killed, 27 were foreign nationals.
MEHMET KOCARSLAN, REINA NIGHTCLUB OWNER (via translator): We are very sad about the 27 foreign nationals who, despite the warnings of their government, believed Turkey was a safe place.
(END VIDEOTAPE)
HUDDY: And tonight, Turkey's train and bus stations, the airports, also the border crossings remain on high alert. The hope is that this New Year's Day killer is still in Turkey and has not already slipped across the border into Syria. Bret?
BAIER: John Huddy in our Middle East newsroom, John, thank you.
More detainees will be transferred from the detention center at Guantanamo Bay. The White House said today to expect additional transfers to be announced before President Obama leaves office. The news comes on the heels of a tweet from president-elect Trump this morning in which he wrote, quote, ""There should be no further releases from Gitmo. These are extremely dangerous people and should not be allowed back onto the battlefield."" Defense officials tell FOX News they expect a transfer of nearly 20 more detainees before inauguration day.
Customs and Border Patrol officials say all systems are back up and running after a four hour outage at airports Monday across the country. Travelers waited in long lines after a problem with the processing system for international passengers Monday. Customs and border patrol say there is an initial investigation showing that a problem with the changes to software used to process travelers, and now that issue has been resolved. During that outage, border agents processed travelers using alternative procedures until the system came back online.
President-elect Donald Trump gets Congress to change its course of action even before he gets into the Oval Office. We'll explain when the all-star panel weighs in on the Power Play next.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
REP. PAUL RYAN, (R) SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES: So I want to say to the American people, we hear you. We will do right by you, and we will deliver. To the minority, I want to say this. We've never shied away from our disagreements, and I do not expect anyone to do so now. But however bright of a contrast that we draw between us, it must never blind us to the common ground that we share.
NANCY PELOSI, (D-CA) HOUSE MINORITY LEADER: House Democrats pledged to seek common ground wherever we can. To forge a bipartisan path forward on jobs creating infrastructure, to make taxes and foreign trade fair to American workers.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
BAIER: Well, wit that, the 115th Congress went into session, but not before some drama. Today you had a situation where the House Republicans reversed themselves. Last night they went into closed session and they decided to abandon this ethics, independent ethics group outside of the congressional ethics committee, the Office of Congressional Ethics. Then Donald Trump on Twitter said this. ""With all that Congress has to work on, do they really have to make the weakening of the independent ethics watchdog, as unfair as it may be, their number one act and priority? Focus on tax reform, health care, and so many other things of far greater importance."" From the president-elect's Twitter feed. Then the House Republicans abandoned it. Not everybody was happy about it, though.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
REP. STEVE KING, (R) IOWA: This decision that was made by the House conference last night was an objective decision made on the activities of the OCE that unjustly target members of Congress, and they should not be subjected to anonymous complaints that are acted upon by a body that leaks that information out to the public and they have to defend themselves in the public. That's unjust. I think we should have gone forward, and I'm going to push for the full disbandment and abolishment of the OCE.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
BAIER: So it was a rocky start. Let's bring it in our panel, editor in chief of Lifezette, Laura Ingraham, Charles Lane, opinion writer for the ""Washington Post,"" and syndicated columnist Charles Krauthammer. OK, Laura, what about this rollout, abolishment of this office, and what image looked like?
LAURA INGRAHAM, EDITOR IN CHIEF, LIFEZETTE.COM: It was disastrous timing and messaging. For the first moment out the gate, they had the story out there. When I woke up and I saw this this morning, I thought to myself, you've got to be kidding me. Donald Trump just won this startling victory based on draining the swamp. And once again, I think the substance on this aside, which I think Steve King has that point about out this anonymous complaints and so forth, but just in the storytelling aspect of this, the story you are telling to the American people after Donald Trump wins this upset victory, is that we are going to change the ethics office so that it's fairer to Congress.
Now, he was absolutely right to come out as he did. I had Marsha Blackburn on my radio show at 10:30 this morning. She had a hard time defending it on timing and messaging. She agreed that the Republicans bungled these things time and again. Trump reads the pulse of the people again better than the rank-and-file Republican on Capitol Hill. And Paul Ryan actually voted against this, we understand. But he wasn't able to turn enough votes.
BAIER: The leadership, both Paul Ryan and Kevin McCarthy, others were against it. But here's Bob Goodlatte, Chuck, who was the chairman of the committee judiciary, ""The House must have a rules package under which to operate and serve our constituents, and ultimately accepting the amendment from Majority Leader McCarthy was the only way to assure the passage."" That means making it go away. ""While I understand the need to do so, I am wholly disappointed that these important reforms to strengthen due process rights and the mission of the OCE did not move forward. Gross misrepresentation by opponents of my amendment and the media willing to go along with this agenda resulted in a flurry of misconceptions and unfounded claims about the true purpose of the amendment."" He's trying to get into the weeds of defending this, but the bottom-line, Chuck, is that the president-elect's Twitter account changed the outcome.
CHARLES LANE, OPINION WRITER, ""WASHINGTON POST"": He seems to change quite a few things with tweets. I think there's a plant in Indiana that's going to have more people working at it because of some tweets. This is a really interesting unforced error because the history of this office goes back to the last time the Democrats took over the Congress back when George W. Bush was still president. And Nancy Pelosi had the slogan ""drain the swamp."" In pursuit of the drain the swamp movement by the Democrats they put in the office. As it develops, quite a few Democrats ran afoul of this. Mel Watt was heard to get some of the very same kinds of complaints you just heard Steve King doing.
BAIER: Let me just interrupt you. There was bipartisan opposition to this.
LANE: Precisely my point. Mel Watt is a Democrat. And my point being that I don't understand how the Republicans couldn't find a way to maybe wait a little while and work with the Democrats on something in common because there are quite a few Democrats who privately agree with what they've done even while they are publicly making a lot of hay out of it right now.
BAIER: Meantime on the Senate side, the top Democrat there, Chuck Schumer, took the floor for his first speech, talking about the president-elect's communication.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
CHARLES SCHUMER, (D-NY) SENATE MINORITY LEADER: These issues are too important for mere words. Our challenge is too entrenched for mere tweeting. Making America great again requires more than 140 characters per issue. With all due respect, America cannot afford a Twitter presidency.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
BAIER: Charles?
CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER, SYNDICATED COLUMNIST: Sore loser. The tweets are working. If they weren't, they wouldn't be using them. As Chuck indicated, Trump has used it on North Korea, he used it on Ford, General Motors on this issue, which he won within hours, and it works. It has a lot of effect. And he's not even in office.
I think when he is in office, it will be a little more problematic because people will be presuming policy out of this, and it's hard to be -- it's hard to be either detailed or specific enough in a tweet to actually make coherent policy periods
BAIER: Nuance is thought in 140 characters.
KRAUTHAMMER: Yes. Right now what Trump is doing is wielding a two-by- four. And he certainly had to do it in the case of the House because these guys are mules. That was about the dumbest first step you could ever make particularly because, as we just heard, this is an issue on which Democrats agree there are real problems with this office they wanted to abolish, the idea of sort of procedure, giving people a chance to defend themselves openly is really quite weakened, as it should be reformed. But you don't do it in the middle of the night. You don't do it as a first act, and you don't do it without Democratic support. It's just plain stupid.
BAIER: Laura, I want to get to the tweets on GM. Today the president- elect, ""General Motors is sending Mexican made model of Chevy Cruze to U.S. car dealers across border. Make in USA. Will pay big border tax."" GM released a statement about that tweet, saying ""General Motors manufactures the Chevy Cruze Sedan in Lordstown, Ohio. All Chevy Cruze sedan sold in the U.S. are built in GM's assembly plant in Lordstown, Ohio. GM builds the Chevy Cruze hatchback for global markets in Mexico with a small number sold in the U.S."" The last line essentially confirms that some of those cars are made in Mexico. What about the specific company kind of going after specific issues on Twitter?
INGRAHAM: I think ultimately the better policy will be corporate tax reform, real regulatory reform that makes the environment here in the United States a lot more hospitable to innovation, job creation, for business to stay here. But right now he's in this interesting period 17 days before inauguration. He already has at least symbolically some of these wins on the board. And PR-wise, I think they are good for what he wants to do with a more populist approach to Republican policy and also for these companies. They are feeling huge pressure from the public at large. Go on message boards, you go on Facebook. They were getting hammered. Carrier was, Carrier air conditioning, and the car company. But the CEO today in various interviews said they are doing what's best for their company. I think he was trying to distance the Trump tweets as having much of an influence.
BAIER: Ford watches the tweets and they made the announcement on their own. You saw Lockheed. You saw Boeing take a hit in stocks after these tweets. Chuck, last word on this.
LANE: It astonishes me that people are taking in stride the future president of the United States is going around threatening free enterprises with punishment for dong what is in their best interests and in the interest of their stockholders. The only thing more shocking is the spinelessness of the companies who knuckle under it.
KRAUTHAMMER: It really can't go on. You can't really in an economy with hundreds of millions, tens of millions of workers, you are getting these small gains here and there. It obviously is working and portraying the image of Trump as a guy who delivers on promises, who wants to protect the working people. But in the end you can't govern this way. These are small pebbles in the pond, and it's got to be larger policy. It worked as president-elect. I don't think it's something he can do as president.
BAIER: We will see. Next up, more on the president-elect's tweets. This time a look at how foreign nations are reacting, and specifically North Korea and how dangerous that is.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
PETER COOK, PENTAGON PRESS SECRETARY: The reason we have more than 28,000 troops in South Korea right now ready to fight tonight, this is a country that's clearly shown a willingness to threaten the United States, threaten our allies in the region, and we are going to continue to do everything we need you to protect ourselves from that threat.
KELLYANNE CONWAY, TRUMP CAMPAIGN MANAGER: He's putting North Korea on notice through this tweet and through other statements that this won't happen. He as president of the United States wants to stand between them and the missile capabilities which experts say could be deployed to reach Seattle almost immediately.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
BAIER: OK, they are talking about more tweets, this time on foreign policy. The president-elect saying ""North Korea just stated that it is in the final stages of developing a nuclear weapon capable of reaching parts of the U.S. It won't happen."" Continuing, ""China has been taking up massive amounts of money and wealth from the U.S. in totally one-sided trade but won't help with Korea. Nice.""
Let's be clear, at the end of that last panel, we were saying, Charles was saying that it might not work policy-wise long-term, but it is working now as far as moving the needle as president-elect.
INGRAHAM: Well, here's the stark reality. This is going to be, I believe, his first major challenge as commander-in-chief. North Korea doesn't get the attention it deserves as a major geopolitical struggle for the United States. And since 1953 we've had an armistice with North Korea. They war never really ended. We've had an armistice in place. That's why we have all the troops there.
China doesn't want that regime to collapse. If it does, there will be a massive spillover in China. So they really haven't done much of anything to help. They don't want the cabbage patch doll president of North Korea - - sorry, but that's what he looks like -- they don't want him to go nuclear, but they don't want the ridging to disintegrate. So what does Trump do? Do we want a preemptive war, preemptive strike against the ICBM sites in North Korea? Obama tried, we want six party talks. That never happened.
BAIER: Bush tried it too.
INGRAHAM: Madeleine Albright was clinking champagne glasses with Kim Jong- il. And none of it worked. And now we are on the brink of perhaps in the next two to three years their having nuclear capability. It's not an easy situation, but, again, it's not going to be handled necessarily by a tweet.
BAIER: Here's what the White House said. Josh Earnest on North Korea.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
JOSH EARNEST, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: The intelligence community has previously said that the United States has not seen North Korea test or demonstrate the ability to miniaturize a nuclear weapon and put it on an ICBM. I'm not aware that that assessment has changed. And some of the administration, the intelligence community officials I have spoken to today were not aware that assessment has changed. If it has changed, it is something that will come from the intelligence community. With regard to the president-elect's tweets, I will let his team explain.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
BAIER: So Chuck, so far they are not seeing it develop yet, but it seems like they're heading that way. They've had a lot of tests and failures, North Korea has. And they do rattle the saber a lot to try to get deals on food.
LANE: The key question, I guess, strategically and militarily is whether or not they can load a working nuclear device onto the ICBM. That's the threshold they haven't gotten past yet. And we have time in that sense. But the question is, can we find out that they have that capability before they actually test it and before it's actually kind of out there and ready to go?
BAIER: Historically the intel out of North Korea is really bad.
LANE: Very tough. And I couldn't really improve on the summary Laura gave you of exactly how difficult this choice is going to be. It's worth remembering that at the very beginning of Bill Clinton's administration they came about that close, the Clinton administration, to getting into a preemptive war with North Korea based on what they perceived the progress to have been at that time, which led to the 20-plus years of failed negotiations we've had since. If it did come to a conflict with North Korea over this, you couldn't say that the United States hasn't given diplomacy a chance, because it's been tried and hasn't worked for over 20 years.
BAIER: And both parties' administrations running the White House. Charles, if you look around the world, Syria, or Iran, what's happening all over the Middle East, do you see North Korea as the biggest threat?
KRAUTHAMMER: It is because it's a threat to the actual existence of San Francisco. Syria is an issue but it's not a threat to the lives of a million Americans. And this is a regime that is completely unpredictable. And remember, our ability to predict nuclear going all the way back to the Second World War is terrible. We did not predict the Russians in '49, the Chinese in '64, India or Pakistan. We had no idea. We were caught by surprise.
Look, there are only three options. One is a preemptive strike on the missile launchers, which will inevitably immediately precipitate a land war. They're going to invade South Korea. The other is to shoot down the missile using our defensive systems, which we probably can do, although who knows? The Democrats have a tendency to go easy on testing the defensive missiles. The third is not what Trump thinks, which is economic pressure. It's not going to work on the Chinese. We have tried that regarding North Korea. There is one thing I believe that will deter them. We announce that we look favorably on Japan and South Korea acquiring defensive nukes. That will scare the hell out of the Chinese and it might move them to do something.
BAIER: Quickly, Laura, China is the key.
INGRAHAM: It always has been. I think Charles is right to throw out that option. Trump is unpredictable on this. That's good. The old do it the sanctions way, that hasn't worked. The unpredictability might be actually in his favor in this regard.
BAIER: That is it for the panel. Next up, a little fun from today's swearing-in.
BAIER: Finally, tonight, there are usually some funny moments as families gather for their ceremonial pictures of loved ones getting sworn in and the Senate and the House. This new Congress delivered, as well.

0	51	 52 von 72	Fox News Network	January 3, 2017 Tuesday	 THE FIVE	 5:00 PM EST		"KIMBERLY GUILFOYLE, THE FIVE HOST, FOX NEWS: Hello, everyone. I am Kimberly Guilfoyle along with Geraldo Rivera, Eric Bolling, Dana Perino and Greg Gutfeld. Its 5:00 in New York City and this is ""The Five"".""
Happy 2017 everyone.
GREG GUTFELD, THE FIVE HOST, FOX NEWS: Yay!
GUILFOYLE: Greg had a good time, and we hope you all had a great holiday weekend. A ton of news to break down tonight. We begin with the Russian hacking controversy. The Obama administration has implicated Moscow for disrupting our election. But on New Year's Eve, our president-elect expressed doubts that Russia was to blame for cyber attacks on Democratic Party officias.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT-ELECT: -- and I know a lot about hacking and hacking is very hard thing to prove. So it could be someone else. And I also know things other people don't know and so they cannot be sure of the situation.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Things like what do you know that other people don't know?
TRUMP: You'll find out on Tuesday or Wednesday.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
GUILFOYLE: The founder of WikiLeaks adamantly denies Russia was his source for hacked e-mails his group released before the election. Here's Julian Assange in an exclusive interview with Sean Hannity that airs tonight at 10:00 p.m. Eastern.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
SEAN HANNITY, HANNITY HOST, FOX NEWS: Can you say to the American people unequivocally that you did not get this information about the DNC, John Podesta's e-mails, can you tell the American people 1000 percent you did not get it from Russia or anybody associated with Russia?
JULIAN ASSANGE, FOUNDER, WIKILEAKS: We can say and we have said repeatedly over the last two months that our source is not the Russian government and it is not state party.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
GUILFOYLE: OK, so big interview, an exclusive, Eric, with Julian Assange. Sean Hannity sat down with him echoing the same statements that he's made before which is, that he said that the Russians were not his source for those hacked leaked material.
ERIC BOLLING, THE FIVE HOST, FOX NEWS: And also he clarified even further and said, and not a state player, not a state actor which would tell you -- so they couldn't or lead you to believe Julian Assange. They wouldn't have used an outside source to leak this, you know, just to get the information, they hack and they hand it over but financed by the Russian government if you believe what you heard right there, which I do.
I've maintained from the very beginning this is about, you know, it could even be a leak, it could even be an inside leak from within the DNC. Some of the stuff is there, some phishing scams going on. You know, Podesta actually opened an e-mail -- open here for, you know, this great offer -- you open it and it ends up eating into their -- inside their data.
But if Julian Assange is -- and WikiLeaks is all about transparency, is all about bringing truth to light, right, then you would have to believe that it didn't come from the Russians. My biggest problem was that McCain and Lindsey Graham saying they're going to lead the next congress into more strident and stringent sanctions against the Russians before we even know what the evidence is.
GUILFOYLE: OK, so Dana, there's an investigation that is underway. Obviously it would make sense to be able to get the full amount of information from the variety of agencies before making a factual determination one way or the other.
DANA PERINO, THE FIVE HOST, FOX NEWS: I just find this whole thing totally bewildering and I don't understand actually -- I have a question. S, you said that if Assange says -- because WikiLeaks is supposed to be about transparency, if what Assange, we should take as proof?
BOLLING: Well, if you believe what he's about, leaking truth, exposing truth. You know, I haven't seen any -- correct me if I'm wrong -- I haven't seen anything where WikiLeaks has actually brought something out that was inaccurate. They are just leaking information.
GERALDO RIVERA, THE FIVE HOST, FOX NEWS: How about the fact the guy is a fugitive from two sex assault charges and he's been hiding right in the Ecuadorian embassy in London.
BOLLING: Again, it shows --
RIVERA: And I wouldn't believe the stuff (ph) you said today was inaccurate. BOLLING: That's a different story. Listen, I don't disagree with you on a personal level but everything he has done that I know o, well I'm maybe wrong, but I know he's been leaking information --
RIVERA: You believe him because you like what he leaked. You did not believe when --
BOLLING: You know, that's a fair assessment.
RIVERA: -- it was Edward Snowden or Bradley Manning or the video of the tower Apache choppers --
BOLLING: Por favor, I'm (inaudible) well.
GUTFELD: Here's the -- may be what he leaked was the truth but he leaked the names of Afghans who are helping us fight the Taliban so it may have been true but he screwed over a lot of people and put people's lives in danger. The bottom line is Assange went from a hero, I mean from zero to a hero among the right because he is screwing over Obama. Bottomline.
RIVERA: Agree.
GUTFELD: There's nothing -- that's all it is.
GUILFOYLE: Well, and Hillary.
GUTFELD: Yes, exactly. But there's a difference between hacking and phishing. Hacking is you break into somebody's safe and you steal their money. Phishing is when you steal somebody's bicycle because they left it out in front of a liquor store. So we have to define what we're talking about.
This may not be hacking. It may be phishing. But that's separate from Assange. We can't, you know, we have to understand, Assange is playing us and will play us. When he has information on Fox, when he has information on Trump, he's going to use it too and we're all going to be like, wow, what a bunch of suckers we were.
BOLLING: Or being consistent saying, yeah, wow, that sucks that he did that but again, show me the inaccuracy.
RIVERA: I wonder what your tone would be if it was the RNC instead of the DNC.
BOLLNG: Oh, the tone would be very different. It was different. In fact before, Greg is 100 percent right. I'm guilty of this from day one. When we first learned about WikiLeaks, I was like, wow, this is terrible. This guy is awful. And now I'm saying I have a different tone but I'm being consistent here. I like the fact --
RIVERA: He allegedly raped two interns.
BOLLING: Oh, Geraldo, that has nothing to do with what he's leaking.
RIVERA: No, I wonder what it has got to do with it -- has a thing to do with it.
BOLLING: I am not saying he is a stand-up guy and I want to, you know, I want to go on vacation with him.
RIVERA: The guy is a rundown, dirty, scumbag --
BOLLING: Are you accusing him of leaking anything inaccurate?
RIVERA: I am accusing him of being anti-American. I believe that he has in his interest to undermine the American democracy --
BOLLING: Is Snowden anti-American?
RIVERA: -- and he chose to do it this way. I think that Snowden is also anti-American.
BOLLING: I disagree with you on that one.
GUILFOYLE: All right, well the WikiLeaks founder also offered some insight on why he thinks the Obama administration is pinning the hacking on Russia. Here is more from Sean's exclusive interview with Julian Assange.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
ASSANGE: Our publications had wide uptake by the American people. They are all true. But that's not the allegation that is being presented by the Obama White House. So, why such a dramatic response? Well, the reason is obvious. They are trying to delegitimize the Trump administration as it goes into the White House. They're going to try -- they are trying to say that president-elect Trump is not a legitimate president.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
GUILFOYLE: All right, Dana, your reaction to that aspect of Assange. This is Obama being sort of covert and trying to pin this on to Russia.
PERINO: I think a couple things for Trump.
GUOLFOYLE: OK.
PERINO: But I missed joke. What's our joke? I missed it. OK. Tell me in the break.
GUTFELD: Yes.
PERINO: OK. I think that part of this could be true, right. So, it would behoove the Democrats to be able to pin their devastating loss on something other than Hillary's bad campaign and she was a bad candidate.
GUILFOYLE: Sure.
PERINO: In my mind, like if you're trying to justify a loss and explain to your donors why you blew a billion dollars on an ultimately a winnable race, and she didn't even go to Wisconsin. All those things, it would help you, I guess, to say well look, the Russians hacked in the DNC therefore the Russians are going to be punished and the Democrats can't comfort themselves with the thought that that's why they lost the election.
I think that could possibly be true. But I also think that we know from President Obama that he knew in October something was going on with the Russians because he tells us later that he told Putin to knock it off. I don't know if Putin did or didn't.
That's the other thing that so frustrating about this, is that the politicization of intelligence and it's putting me and other people I think in a strangely uncomfortable partisan position. I don't know what the truth is. Donald Trump says he has more information or different information than the intel community. They maybe are going to get together this week. I don't even know how much of that they can tell us anyway.
GUTFELD: But there's one positive thing to get out of this and that is we're finally -- if we get past the politics, you know, we get in and Trump is president and everybody is kind of calming down. We can focus on the nature of the threats. Thank God this was some kind of low-level phishing and could have been worse.
We have to start thinking about what this means, the larger scope of technology and terror when you have rogue nations and isolated agents like ISIS who can paralyze and pulverize our systems. At least now we are being pointed in the right direction, even if this was just a bunch of guys phishing with like e-mails about, you know, yes.
GUILFOYLE: What we should be concerned about cyber security and any kind of threats and anyone who would choose to try to influence the United States presidential election or interfere with our government process to begin with. That there is information about China hacking, you know, into the White House before what was done about that. So when you look at reciprocity and in terms of their reaction and actions towards it, where were all the sanctions then against China?
PERINO: And maybe there were actions but they didn't announce them.
GUILFOYLE: Correct.
PERINO: So why the announcement of this one is strange. I do think also it's worth reading because people have a chance to go back, last week in ""The Wall Street Journal"" there was an op-ed by a guy named Edward J. Epstein and it was called ""The Fable o Ed Snowden"" and it does this interesting, his analysis of a connection between Snowden and Assange and how Assange sent his deputy to Hongkong to take Snowden back to Russia.
So, I could see where if you're sitting at the White House, you're thinking why can't people see this obviously for what it is? But there is just no trust with the intelligence community. I don't know how much more they can tell us, show us.
BOLLING: They can give us the exact, you know, right now, we're understanding that 17 intelligence agencies have the information that led them to believe that the Russians hacked the DNC --
RIVERA: (INAUDIBLE)
BOLLING: Yes, but they won't show us -- not one has shown us what they have, Geraldo, and that's the point. Now we have a guy who leaked them saying they're wrong. There is no Russian attachment to this.
RIVERA: Let's assume for a second that Assange is telling the literal truth. It was not a state actor. If Vladimir Putin gets 100 bright Russian cyber kids and gives them the highest powered, high voltage, high octane Mac computer and says go do this to Podesta as Gmail, and it's not the KGB. I mean he could literally be finessing the truth. He could --
BOLLING: That would be a state actor. Vladimir Putin as president of Russia are hiring --
RIVERA: Do you disbelieve --
BOLLING: Here's what I believe --
RIVERA: -- the president of the United States and his intelligence agencies when they say with confidence that it was the Russians who did it and they have the Cyrillic keyboard and all the rest. Do you disbelieve our president and our intelligence community?
BOLLING: I would like to see --
RIVERA: Answer that.
BOLLING: Let me answer you this way. I also believe that we weren't being data mined by the NSA, every single American, until Edward Snowden whistle blow and said guess what, they go around (inaudible) every single American's data is being mined illegally.
RIVERA: Well, I didn't know that either.
BOLLING: I've trusted their men (ph) too.
RIVERA: Take his point. Now we're all settled. Everybody is in office. God bless the 45th president of the United States. How concerned are you now about cyber security?
BOLLING: Oh, but by the way, your scenario where Putin has 100 of their best and brightest is probably one of 100 countries doing the exact same thing.
RIVERA: I don't disagree. I don't disagree.
GUTFELD: OK, here's how you can look at WikiLeaks --
GUIILFOYLE: -- power (ph) the president is going to handle it.
GUTFELD: Ultimately WikiLeaks is a conduit for extortion. All right, someone phishes you then goes to you and demands money, you say no. The phisher can actually give it to WikiLeaks and Assange because therefore their hands are clean and Assange goes, I am all about transparency. I'm going to screw you over.
BOLLING: But do we have that though? Do we have any evidence where someone is saying I got this Podesta --
GUTFELD: But let me, OK --
BOLLING: But if you don't give me money --
GUTFELD: But your argument is like you would rather trust Assange than our military intelligence. I mean, we have conservatives that are now basically smearing our intelligence.
BOLLING: No, no. In one hand with Assange, I see e-mails, I see names with e-mails. On the other hand, 17 intelligence agencies are telling us trust us, it happened. Meanwhile, no one is willing to step up and say here's one shred of evidence.
RIVERA: Nor has the president-elect with all due respect, nor has the president-elect.
GUILFOYLE: Well we have to see though in fact if he does that because we have to give him a chance to get into office where it's his, you know, it's appropriate for him.
RIVERA: He said it would happen today or tomorrow.
GUILFOYLE: Right, he did say that, but we also have to see what's happening behind the scenes in terms of when he's going to offer (ph) that kind of evidence and support and what he decides to tell the American people --
BOLLING: And if there is that evidence --
GUILFOYLE: And maybe he waits until he says --
BOLLING: -- if there is that evidence, I'm front and center saying, sanction them. Harder sanctions than these toothless sanctions we've offered so far.
GUTFELD: I have advice to Chelsea Manning. Start bashing Obama. The Republicans are going to love you.
GUILFOYLE: You know he's actually requesting that President Obama pardon him, right -- her -- him.
(CROSSTALK)
GUTFELD: She should actually -- she should say -- she should say that she believes that Donald Trump is doing the right thing and then all of a sudden we'll love Chelsea Manning just the way we now love Assange.
GUILFOYLE: Oh damn.
RIVERA: That makes two of us.
GUILFOYLE: Part one of Sean Hannity's exclusive interview with Julian Assange airs tonight at 10:00 p.m. eastern on Fox News Channel. Don't miss that. Much more to come on ""The Five."" Never a dull moment because it's a brand new year and a new era in Washington. The new Congress sworn in today. Republicans in control are gearing up to unravel eight years worth of president Obama's policies. Next.
PERINO: Today, the 115th Congress was sworn in on Capitol Hill. Republicans control both houses and they're gearing up to enact the most ambitious conservative policy agenda in decades with the Republican president taking office in 17 days. Their mission, to unravel eight years of president Obama's policies starting with Obamacare. Minority leader Nancy Pelosi is warning Republicans to exercise caution.
(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)
NANCY PELOSI, HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVE MINORITY LEADER: The fact is it's the old thing of going into a china shop. You break it. You own it. And this is -- they're dealing with something that is very, when I say complex, it's sophisticated. They have shown nothing in their ranting and raving that shows any level of knowledge of where they would go or where they would take this.
(END AUDIO CLIP)
PERINO: Incoming White House counselor Kellyanne Conway says the president-elect will follow through on his pledge to voters.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
KELLYANNE CONWAY, INCOMINNG WHITE HOUSE COUNSELOR: -- he's committed to repeal and replacing Obamacare so it is more fair to people, you know, Katie, we hear from people about this issue almost more than anything else. This and Veterans Care. And what they say are two quick things. One is I thought I was going to get better coverage but I've just been cut. My hours were cut down to 25 to not get that coverage (INAUDIBLE) and now I have two jobs and no coverage.
Number two, it's people who thought that they have great coverage. Now they feel like their premiums have increased. Their choices in access are decreased and the quality is less.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
PERINO: So Greg, you heard Nancy Pelosi there who, remember, she was the one who said you have to pass it in an order to find out what's in it. And then she said if you break it, you buy it. Now the Republicans want to fix it and I guess if they fix it, they still have to buy it.
GUTFELD: I'm still confused.
PERINO: Somebody call the hardware store.
GUTFELD: Her voice is like butter made of steel wool. When you hear it, it just grates along your brain. Now, they claim that they're going to be accountable, right. We're going to force the president to be accountable. So, it's like going outside after eight years to the bright sun. They've been wearing blindfolds for the past eight years, not holding president Obama accountable for anything. And now all of a sudden they're going to wake up and do their job. Shut up.
PERINO: Speaking of that, here is the Democratic majority leader -- I'm sorry -- minority leader Chuck Schumer on that very issue.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
CHUCK SCHUMMER, SENATE MINORITY LEADER: This will be an accountability congress and we will be a caucus that makes sure the president-elect keeps his commitment to truly make America great again. If president-elect Trump lets the hard right members of Congress and his cabinet run the show, if he attempts to adopt their time worn policies which benefit the elites, the special interests, corporate America, not the working man and woman, his presidency will not succeed.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
PERINO: All right. I guess you've been warned.
GUILFOYLE: OK, scary (ph) Schumer. I was so scared, right. He was like looking down talking about the elites.
PERINO: I'd say that wasn't his best performance.
GUILFOYLE: It certainly wasn't. So again, it just shows that the Democratic Party is bereft of promising compelling leadership. There are certainly no orators present like Barack Obama to try to help them. You know, he's trying to basically do a shot across the bow to the president- elect. I don't think this going to frighten the 45th president of the United States.
I mean he's going to say, I'm going to run my game. I'm going to run my show. I'm going to do what I intend to do and on with the promises to the American people. I don't think Chuck Schumer is going to have the sway to try to terrify him, bottomline.
PERINO: So, earlier also Nancy Pelosi was talking about on Obamacare how the Republicans don't have any plans to replace it but Kellyanne Conway answered that part as well.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
CONWAY: One of the big priorities for president-elect Trump and his Republican congress would be to make it easier for Americans to purchase health care across state lines. We also were talking about a more patient- centric fee market system.
KATIE COURIC, GLOBAL NEWS ANCHOR, YAHOO NEWS: There are some aspects of the Affordable Care Act that Donald Trump has in fact praised. Is he committed to maintaining those parts of the law?
CONWAY: He is committed to retaining those pieces that his advisors will say are working.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
PERINO: I think Eric, that Congress and especially the Senate, the budget rules, the parliamentarian, nitpicking it all together, will really frustrate the White House.
BOLLING: Yes, but also I saw Kellyanne this morning and also Sean Spicer talking about this and what was very refreshing is I see, yes, we are going to repeal Obamacare piecemeal. You know, they'll take it apart that way they can do right from the very get-go, from the very start, which is what Pelosi was warning against.
PERINO: Right.
BOLLING: But then Spicer came back and said, ""And that will buy us time to come up with a plan,"" because he was asked, well, what's the replacement plan? He said, ""Well, hold on a second, the problem with Obamacare is it's a one-sided plan.
There was Democrats had an idea, it was all there idea and the Republicans didn't really get to put any input into it, and he said that the Trump administration wants to take the Democrats, embrace them -- their ideas and come up with something that works for both sides. I hope they do that. I think they'll do that and I think --
PERINO: Yes, Geraldo, don't you -- I don't know if you agree with this or not, but wouldn't it be smart of Democrats to try to help fix it at this point?
RIVERA: Well, I think first of all Donald Trump with his tweets this morning on the Senate ethics or the Congressional ethics oversight was brilliant. He showed beyond a doubt that he's the new sheriff in town.
The Republicans dominate the Congress but Donald Trump dominates the Republicans. He is the boss. He's going to be the 45th president. I think anyone who voted for him can be very proud of him today. I think that he was absolutely the courageous, independent thinker that we thought he was all these long months and the decades that I've known him.
I think that Ryan and McCarthy and these other guys, they better get their act together when it comes to Obamacare specifically. I think that he has made very clear he's not going to touch Medicaid, he's not going to touch social security. Obamacare, Eric's idea to cross state lines, I think they'll adopt that, and that's great. They should have had that. Obama should have had that a long time ago, but I think -- you're not going to see an up -- you're not going to see a profound upheaval of the status quo.
BOLLING: Can I add something? The tweet Donald Trump did that changed the gutting of that ethics committee was brilliant but it also told every Republican, relax. I mean they walked into the 115th Congress on day one to say, hey, look at this. We got policy of the Senate. We have the White House in 17 days. This is going to be great.
Let's start with this. Who thought that the first thing -- order of business would be the gutting -- an ethics committee would be the first order of business, would be a smart thing to do and to his credit, you're right Geraldo, Donald Trump put a stop to it and said --
(CROSSTALK)
GUTFELD: Who is the guy that's going like, we've got to stop the ethics? It's the guy who's definitely got something on him.
GUILFOYLE: Yes, exactly.
(CROSSTALK)
GUILFOYLE: It's the guiltiest guy in the room.
RIVERA: All people being investigated or have been investigated.
PERINO: He actually probably could have gotten that done -- they probably could have gotten it done with bipartisan support if they had chosen to, but the more interesting thing was that Ryan and McCarthy were against it and they held a secret vote anyway. I mean --
RIVERA: On a Monday night where --
GUILFOYLE: But it just, yes, there was no impetus for that to say this is (inaudible) circumstances. Whatever we do, let's rush this. This is our lead. It shows just bad timing and poor judgment and it shows also the economy of the new president-elect to come in and say boom and squash something like that and make his voice heard --
(CROSSTALK)
PERINO: But what he said was, do you really want to spend your time doing that?
GUILFOYLE: Which is a good question, a good question.
PERINO: OK, big news today from the nation's top two automakers, GM and Ford, both involves production in Mexico. President-elect Trump of course has a lot to say about it all so, we'll be back with that, next.
BOLLING: The nation's two largest automakers making some big news today. In a turnaround, Ford announced its scrapping its plans to build a brand new $1.6 billion plant in Mexico. It will invest in a Michigan manufacturing base instead. The move comes just hours after president-elect Donald Trump blasted rival General Motors for building some of its cars south of the border in a tweet no less. Here's Ford CEO on his motivation to reverse course.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
MARK FIELDS, CEO AND PRESIDENT, FORD MOTORS: We are encouraged by the pro- growth policies that president-elect Trump and the new Congress have indicated that they will pursue. And we believe that these tax and regulatory reforms are critically important to boost U.S. competiveness and of course drive a resurgence in American manufacturing and high-tech innovation.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
BOLLING: All right, KHG, taxes and regulatory reforms.
GUILFOYLE: Yes.
BLLING: Business leaders like it.
GUILFOYLE: Yes. Business leaders do like it. This should be an environment where businesses thrive in this country. This country was founded on the principles of free market and economic competition.
That's why this would work, as well, for Obamacare, to say, ""Let's be able to let people buy stuff across state lines. Let's make this an environment that's attractive for businesses to invest in this country,"" like we see with the companies saying, ""OK. Let's build the plants here. Let's make sure that there's manufacturing jobs. Let's put people back into work on the assembly line.""
All of these things would be very good, will help drive the economy and the numbers. But you also have to make sure that you are not overly regulated. Because that does stifle the businesses, and it does stifle entrepreneurship. That, coupled with a really problematic area of healthcare, where people don't want to hire long-term employees full-time, which basically, it leads to better job numbers, because they are reticent to do so in a hostile work environment.
BOLLING: And Dana, in a strange twist of events, the United Auto Workers are happy with Donald Trump today for keeping 700 more jobs here.
PERINO: But you can tell. There is definitely a palpable feeling amongst business leaders in America that things are going to get better. And I think that that sort of confidence is showing through in some of these decisions.
And so while some of -- I think that some of the companies are trying to be a little too cute by half, right? They're trying to have it both ways. They're announcing things that were already announced, or they're coming forward with P.R. -- in some way, some P.R. stunts, because some of these jobs were never leaving anyway.
That said, I think it's a net plus. Jobs in America are a good thing. And now I think the task beyond that is to look ahead ten to 15 years. Because we even know with Carrier, they said that their future is in automation. So jobs are going to change in America. We have to make sure that there are jobs for those people on the other end, as well.
BOLLING: Greg, I alluded to it in the intro, that Donald Trump this morning tweeted, ""Hey, GM, General Motors, if you're going to build those cars in Mexico and send them in, get ready for a big fat border tax."" And that made Ford say, ""Well, hold on a second. Maybe we'll keep some of these jobs here.""
GUTFELD: That is exactly right, because that isn't -- that is not tax reform. That is a threat.
So what you're talking about, really -- and I'm going to be the wet blanket here -- you're replacing the invisible hand with a government hand. And what's the end result? Ultimately, it's a place like Venezuela.
The great thing about capitalism and free markets is that it's re- distributing the processes, so that, if a company fails, there's another company that will take its place.
But when you centralize the power and let the government to control, when the government makes a huge mistake, everybody suffers.
So I think that these things are interesting, if it's based on, you know, promising tax reform and promising just, you know, lower regulation. But threats of tariffs is protectionism. It's -- on the spectrum from capitalism to socialism, where dos that lead? Here. Socialism.
RIVERA: It is strictly not...
GUILFOYLE: There has to be an incentive on the other side.
BLITZER: But can we just point out...
RIVERA: Exactly.
BLITZER: The Ford CEO didn't -- said he wasn't affected by the facts...
RIVERA: Oh, he's punked out. That's baloney.
BLITZER: He was affected by the lower tax and regulatory environment.
RIVERA: He was affected by the tweet, just like those guys in the Congress. I love that Trump is tweeting. He is going right to the American people. He's bypassing all of us. He's talking right to the people. He is saying, ""This is what I want,"" and he's getting it.
But this is not free market. And I've got news for you. You've got 15,000 jobs that were going to be created just on the other side of the Mexican border that now won't be created.
PERINO: I thought of that.
RIVERA: What are those 15,000 guys going to do? That wall better be 1,000 miles high.
PERINO: I thought of that this morning.
RIVERA: Because now you've got 15,000 eager...
BOLLING: We'll hire them to build the wall.
GUILFOYLE: Yes, but the problem. Just real quick, Bolling, the problem is this whole focus on globalization that we've seen over the past eight years, instead of focusing on America first...
BOLLING: More than eight.
GUILFOYLE: ... has -- for sure -- has made it very difficult for people to keep their jobs, to plan their retirement, feed their families. And this is going to put the focus back here on American soil. And there has to be incentives for them to be able to...
GUTFELD: Globalization has helped people feed their families by lowering the prices of food.
BOLLING: That is true. Except in nationalism, we can have our families feed their families better, because there will be more...
GUTFELD: I think we need to listen to (UNINTELLIGIBLE) nationalism.
RIVERA: Get those coal mines going again. That's another shovel of coal. Let's all be Beijing. We're all going to be Beijing now.
GUILFOYLE: What?
RIVERA: We're all going to have coal burners in our homes.
BOLLING: In favor of this place. American jobs in America.
RIVERA (singing): West Virginia, mountain mama.
BOLLING: Make it here, produce it here, sell it here, buy it here.
Ahead, the Obama administration keeps trying to rewrite history as it heads out the door. This time, one of the president's closest advisors is trying to convince the world her boss has a squeaky-clean legacy, with zero to be embarrassed about. We'll help jog Valerie Jarrett's memory next.
GUTFELD: On Sunday, Val Jarrett went on CNN to defend her pal, President Obama. Hmm. I wonder if the president prides himself on the fact that his administration hasn't had a scandal and that he hasn't done something to embarrass himself.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
VALERIE JARRETT, OBAMA ADVISOR: The president prides himself on the fact that the administration hasn't had a scandal and that he hasn't done anything to embarrass himself.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
GUTFELD: Now, that's a low bar for achievement. He hasn't embarrassed himself.
But it's true. No one on his staff was caught in bed with a giraffe. Yet. But to agree with Val, you've got to ignore the IRS, the DOJ, Benghazi, Secret Service, Bo Bergdahl, and the secret server that led to the orange crush.
GUILFOYLE: That's funny.
GUTFELD: And now, technically it's a scandal telling America you can keep your doctor, a callous deception that hurts millions. And it's a scandal to deny a toxic doctrine fomenting apocalyptic violence. And it's a scandal to ignore the modern black death, a plague currently crippling Chicago.
Obama's tenure had more dirty linen then Charlie Sheen's hamper. But when your heart's in the right place, doing the wrong thing is always forgivable. It may be scandal was just so common we got used to it.
But that's not the point. If I were Obama, I'd gladly take a messy scandal over the moral catastrophic failure of the last eight years. It's the corrosive ambivalence about who we are as a nation as we switched pride for shame. We became our own villains rather than assessing the bigger challenges that threaten all of us.
So yes, congrats on a scandal-free reign. That and a dollar will get you four quarters.
GUILFOYLE: All righty, then.
GUTFELD: I'm going to miss Val.
GUILFOYLE: Are you?
GUTFELD: I'm going to miss her. She was the true president.
GUILFOYLE: The true? You think?
GUTFELD: She was the puppet master. Above President Obama.
GUILFOYLE: That's true. She really was. So maybe it's more of a reflection that she's saying that she has nothing to be ashamed of, that this was an amazing legacy.
But I mean, what about Fast and Furious, IRS...
GUTFELD: Right. I left off a few.
GUILFOYLE: ... and what about all of the veterans who suffered, not getting...
GUTFELD: The V.A.
GUILFOYLE: Right, the V.A. That is a huge problem...
PERINO: Yes.
GUILFOYLE: ... that needs to be fixed immediately. Like, emergency; put that to the front of the line.
But they kind of just go, ""Oh, it's no problem."" IRS spying on journalist James Rosen. Ask him and his family what he thinks about that.
So they don't see it, though, because they have these new lenses that are called scandal-free. And they've got a protective coating so they don't see anything that's actually really happening out there. Must be nice.
GUTFELD: Geraldo, was the point -- was that there were no, like, Monica Lewinsky? There were no exciting scandals? Like sex scandals?
RIVERA: I think the last part of your monologue was correct. I mean, in terms of the values, or kind of lost ground in the Middle East and so forth.
But you have to admit, no one was impeached. Nobody was indicted.
GUTFELD: Low bar.
RIVERA: Kimberly mentions the Veterans Administration, which is the true - - only true scandal, in my opinion. And General Shinseki was a great general; was a lousy administrator. He was forced to resign. But that wasn't corruption. That was competence.
So I think that the basic integrity of Barack Obama cannot and should not be questioned.
BOLLING: I think I -- we can do that. No, I think there's a foreign policy, a domestic policy.
RIVERA: Like what? Like what?
BOLLING: Well, domestic policy...
RIVERA: Integrity we're talking, not politics.
BOLLING: Well, OK. Then I'll try and do this. I'll try and make a little bit of that leap.
Greg is right. The crime in Chicago is, I would say, the incompetent Department of Justice. But in a bigger -- in a bigger picture, questioning his integrity, the war on law enforcement that he's overseen. He's -- he didn't put an end to Black Lives Matter, the whole movement, this hatred that's going after cops. And it's getting cops killed, and it's making the country domestically less safe. I believe that at the bottom of my heart. And I believe it was on purpose that he looked the other way on a lot of these things.
And on foreign policy, no doubt, I think the Iran deal will be his worst legacy in the history of presidential legacies, because I think Iran is going to thumb their nose at us, and they're going to say, ""You know what? We have the bomb."" And -- and that was under Kerry and Obama.
GUILFOYLE: And ISIS going from J.V. to varsity. Want to thank you for that, too.
GUTFELD: Dana, when people look back, he's a historical president, obviously. First African-American. Beyond that, what kind of impact do you think they're...
PERINO: Well, I think the results are -- it's the issue. And so nothing says these eight years were terrible like Donald Trump kicking their rear end in the election.
GUTFELD: Yes. Watch your mouth.
PERINO: I know. I was on vacation; I'm a little loose.
RIVERA: Yes. That was pretty saucy.
PERINO: Their attempt to write the history, they want to be the first ones to write it.
But you know, Benghazi and who pushed the video. You know who really helped them create those scandal-free glasses were the media. Any time we talked -- remember, you talked about it. Was like, if FOX said it, the immediately, it wasn't an issue.
GUTFELD: Yes. Yes.
PERINO: And one of the big ones that nobody remembers -- the media didn't even cover it, was when the EPA administrator was writing emails under ""Richard Windsor.""
GUTFELD: Yes.
PERINO: And basically going -- basically doing political stuff she wasn't supposed to do from the EPA administrators office. And then she resigned to spend more time with her family, and the media just let it go.
GUTFELD: Yes. Exactly.
PERINO: That was a good one.
GUTFELD: The media spent all the time going after Trump for being his own press secretary. Remember when he was...
GUILFOYLE: John Miller?
GUTFELD: John Miller. That was a big deal. But he wasn't in government. But this person was in government and actually...
PERINO: Yes. Richard Windsor.
GUTFELD: Yes. Was it a woman?
PERINO: It was a woman. I don't remember her name. See? Like nobody remembers.
BOLLING: Jackson.
GUTFELD: Lisa Jackson?
PERINO: Lisa Jackson.
GUTFELD: See? We don't even know.
GUILFOYLE: A pseudonym, yes.
GUTFELD: All right. Ahead, was it sabotage or does Mariah Carey only have herself to blame? That Times Square train wreck on New Year's Eve. Kimberly and Eric witnessed the stage fright firsthand.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
BOLLING: K.G., I don't know. I just saw something happen over here with one Mariah Carey. I think she -- I think she flipped out.
GUILFOYLE: Yes. There was something that went terribly wrong.
BOLLING: There was a meltdown going on. I don't know. We may be reading about this tomorrow in The Post.
GUILFOYLE: With her -- with her...

GUTFELD: Next on ""The Five.""

(MUSIC)
MARIAH CAREY, SINGER: That was...
(END VIDEO CLIP)
RIVERA: Higher. Mariah Carey, she looked great. One of America's greatest divas. But she had a major malfunction on the biggest stage of all, live from Times Square. Tens of millions of people around the world, including our own from up close, Kimberly and Eric. They had a front-row seat to the nuclear New Year's Eve meltdown.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
BOLLING: But K.G., I don't know. I just saw something happen over here with one Mariah Carey. I think she -- I think she flipped out.
GUILFOYLE: Yes. There was something that went terribly wrong.
BOLLING: There was a meltdown going on there. I don't know. We may be reading about this tomorrow in The Post.
GUILFOYLE: With her -- with her live performance.
BOLLING: Yes.
GUILFOYLE: And it seemed she got very upset and walked off the stage. So...
BOLLING: All right, K.G.
GUILFOYLE: All right. So we're not sure, but you're probably going to hear about it pretty soon. We are witnessing here. That's why you have to be here in Times Square to catch all the news.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
RIVERA: FOX News alert, we just got handed the interview she's done -- seriously -- with Entertainment Weekly.
""Now that you've had a few days distance on the New Year's Eve show, what are your feelings about it?"" she was asked by EW.
The answer, Kimberly, Mariah Carey says, ""All I can say is Dick Clark, the late Dick Clark was an incredible person. I was lucky enough to work with him when I first started in the music business. I am of the opinion that Dick Clark would not have let an artist go through that, and he would have been mortified, as I was in real time.""
His company produced it. Whose fault was it?
GUILFOYLE: Well, it sounds a little bit like she's taking a shot at Ryan Seacrest. And then some of her crew was suggesting that she was sabotaged for ratings that embarrassed her.
I mean, look, there were audio issues down there, for sure. Because you have everybody broadcasting from every different network. I mean, from Telemundo to ABC, to FOX, to everyone. So there's a lot of, like, cross. But they should have done a sound check before. My understanding was they didn't do that. And she didn't seem to be in the best condition.
RIVERA: Meaning what? She needed more clothing, what?
GUILFOYLE: Yes. That's what I meant. She wasn't properly dressed for the weather.
RIVERA: You know, Eric, you were there. These 50-cent earpieces can doom a $50 million production.
BOLLING: So my beautiful wife was standing three feet from Mariah Carey, and I'm looking down and she's looking up at me, like ""Are you seeing this?"" And I'm watching. And you could see Mariah Carey visibly upset.
But here's the thing. She didn't do the sound check, No. 1.
GUILFOYLE: Yes, she didn't.
BOLLING: No. 2, you practice this. No. 3, you're a professional. There's something. This can't be the first time your earpiece didn't work. You wing yet. You sing the song that's your biggest hit.
GUILFOYLE: Or sing something.
BOLLING: Or let the audience sing. But she did none of that. She freaked out, and she walked offstage, leaving her two young kids up on the stage. It was -- it was a disaster.
GUILFOYLE: It was, like, a train wreck.
RIVERA: Dana, who do you blame?
PERINO: I want Mariah Carey to take comfort in the fact that I am probably the only American who didn't see it. I'll give her a pass.
GUILFOYLE: And we thank all the many Americans who were actually watching us than watching Mariah Carey.
PERINO: I watched you.
RIVERA: That's right.
PERINO: I missed that part.
RIVERA: Greg, who were you watching.
GUTFELD: Wait, I just got some breaking news here. Mariah Carey is dead. Tired of this story.
Look, this really was a huge...
RIVERA: She's not dead. She's not dead.
GUTFELD: I said dead tired. This is truly an embarrassment. But enough about Don Lemon.
Did you see him pierce his ear? He's like a 12-year-old at Piercing Pagoda.
By the way, the only audio issue, the only audio issue from New Year's Eve is her voice. She sounds like a dolphin with hemorrhoids.
GUILFOYLE: Yes, she's going to have to do more with less, right?
RIVERA: Five Grammys, hundreds of millions of records sold. And he doesn't like her voice.
GUTFELD: Who cares? Who cares? I can't stand her voice!
RIVERA: ""One More Thing"" is up next.
PERINO: She's going on tour with Lionel Richie.
GUILFOYLE: All right. Time now for ""One More Thing"" -- Ms. Dana Perino.
PERINO: So I was away in South Carolina, Bluffton, South Carolina. I have a few pictures. Because you know, we like to do that here.
I played a lot of tennis, and the pros said that I went from a beginner to an intermediate in nine months. So look out on the court.
Macy English making the ""One More Thing."" She's ""One More Thing"" worthy. There she is with a lot of whip cream all over her face, because she got in a little tussle with Peter.
There's the scavenger hunt. Family and friends, and Jasper, of course, on the dock. We had a lot of fun. And you know, family and friends. It was a really, really good time.
And my mom was there. She had the double knee replacement. Not only did she play tennis, which I showed you last week; she also played two rounds of golf. And she can walk everywhere, up stairs. So she's good. She is good to go.
GUTFELD: What, no dog?
PERINO: There was -- if you weren't looking at your phone, you would have seen the dog twice.
But I have another gift for Kimberly. This is...
GUILFOYLE: Firefighters.
PERINO: ... the Charleston Animal Society's 2017 firefighter calendar. This benefits the -- Toby's Fund. And I think she likes it.
GUILFOYLE: I love these guys. This is why I keep getting locked in the bathroom, whatever. They come rescue me. They're very understanding. I love it.
GUTFELD: They're entirely hairless.
GUILFOYLE: I know. Let's see who Mr. March -- I'm sorry.
OK, Greg.
GUTFELD: All right. If you go to FOXNews.com backslash -- or forward slash -- opinion. Never quite sure what it is. But say ""slash opinion."" I originally was running an article review of ""Sully,"" the movie. And then I started thinking about what happens to human heroes in the era of artificial intelligence and algorithms? When no longer hero -- you don't need people to save you in a car or to save you in a plane. So I wrote a piece about the future of heroism. And I think you should check it out. Please do.
PERINO: It's good.
GUTFELD: Thank you very much.
PERINO: You're welcome.
GUILFOYLE (looking at calendar): Wow.
GUTFELD: Kimberly.
GUILFOYLE: May... OK, I'm sorry.
OK, so I have a very special story tonight, and it's going to inspire all of you at home to never give up pursuing your dreams and about the love of a mother for her son.
So this is 22-year-old Joey Fleming. And he has autism. He was recently awarded a Rhodes scholarship and is headed to the University of Oxford later this year, thanks in large part to the measures of his mother. She was getting out of medical school and had a choice to pursue her career or homeschool her son, which he did.
PERINO: Wow.
GUILFOYLE: And it's really an incredible story. He said he's very grateful for his mom putting so much effort into developing his language skills and giving him the mental strength and ability to control his autism.
So all things are possible. So God bless him. Very excited for this family and this young boy.
BOLLING: Very sweet.
PERINO: Indeed.
GUILFOYLE: Really great. Eric.
BOLLING: OK. We talked a little bit about the New Year's Eve special. The numbers came in today and were phenomenal. We should say -- first of all, thank you to K.G. We had a blast doing it together.
GUILFOYLE: Thank you, Eric.
BOLLING: Phil Keating down in Florida. Griff Jenkins. Kat Timpf. And Tyrus did a great job. Rick Leventhal was in the middle of it, as well. I think Pete Doocy was in there, as well. And Jesse and Kennedy did a great job with the first two hours. We took over and did three hours.
But the numbers are in. Total audience up 118 percent versus last year.
RIVERA: Nice.
BOLLING: A record for FOX. Also in the demo, the 25 to 54 up 51 percent versus last year. Also another record.
GUILFOYLE: Yes. Thank you to the producers, the control room, everybody there on the set. It was an A+ effort. All things are possible when you've got a great team like that.
RIVERA: Congratulations.
And happy new year.
GUILFOYLE: Happy new year.
RIVERA: Congratulations also to Arnold Schwarzenegger, Governor Schwarzenegger, you know, the -- hosting now the new edition of ""Celebrity Apprentice."" Up against some tough competition last night, ""The Bachelor."" But he's terrific.
""You're terminated."" ""Hasta la vista, baby."" What? What?
GUILFOYLE: Are you going to be on again?
RIVERA: Will I be? If asked, if asked. Or asked to the inaugural. I may be, like, the lead act.
I went on vacation with my beautiful daughters, Erica and Isabella; Simone and Sol. We went to South Africa, Malala Game Preserve. We had a wonderful, wonderful time. We saw some terrific wildlife. We saw a lion munching on a -- there it is. Bolling wanted me to be the victim there.
GUILFOYLE: I see you survived.
RIVERA: Happy new year.
GUILFOYLE: All right. Well, that's it for us. Happy new year to everybody at home. Thanks for watching. And ""Special Report"" is up next."
0	52	 53 von 72	Fox News Network	January 3, 2017 Tuesday	 YOUR WORLD WITH NEIL CAVUTO	 4:46 PM EST		"NEIL CAVUTO, HOST: All right, just a short time ago, Democratic Congressman Tim Ryan of Ohio having his picture taken with another Ryan, Speaker Paul Ryan. No relation. Of course, he`s a Republican. He`s speaker of the House.
Tim Ryan garnered 63 votes in challenging Nancy Pelosi for the Democratic leadership position. He failed. But no one amassed as many votes challenging her like since she`s been in control of that party in that body.
Tim Ryan joins me right now. 
Congressman, very good to have you. Happy new year.
REP. TIM RYAN (D), OHIO: Happy new year, Neil.
CAVUTO: I noticed today, Congressman, that there were challenges to Nancy Pelosi in the vote. I think it was four votes for Speaker Ryan, but not for her. She still maintained her position as the Democratic leader. But what was that all about?
RYAN: Well, I think there`s still some consternation out there about our messaging and what is best moving forward.
But clearly she won almost all of the Democratic votes here today on the House floor. And she`s going to be our leader. I certainly spoke up about my concerns about that and the direction of the party. And I lost this battle, but we`re going to continue the fight.
CAVUTO: All right, I misspoke there. Two of the votes went to Tim Ryan, to you, not to Paul Ryan. But I got that name stuck in my head.
(LAUGHTER)
RYAN: I will take the extra two.
CAVUTO: But let me ask you. You have been urging the party, that is the Democratic Party, to heed the lessons of this election.
But again and again, what I hear from higher-ups of the party, they blame the Russians, they blame hacking. They say they won the popular vote. So, who really cares? Donald Trump was just sort of like a unique phenomenon. Has nothing to do with them. What do you say to all of that?
RYAN: Well, I come out of the sports world. I played a lot of sports. Coached some a little bit when I was younger.
And I think when you lose, you lose. You have got to go back and watch the game film and figure out what to do next. And, yes, there were a lot of different things that happened in this election that affected the election.
But the rebuilding process can`t stop -- or start with making excuses. It needs to start with, what did we do wrong and what can we do better? And I think the quicker we get down to the point of what we did wrong, and what we can do better, the better off we`re going to be.
And we didn`t have a economic message. We have a message that appeals to just a certain sliver of a human being, as opposed to the robust economic interests that everybody had. We had campaigns for women, campaigns for LGBTQ, campaigns for black, white, brown, gay, straight, Catholic, Protestant, Jewish.
We talked to all of those different segments in just that way, not thinking that, well, if you`re Catholic, you want a job. If you`re gay, you want a job. If you`re brown, you want a job. And we have got to talk about raising wages, getting investment back into the United States, and creating opportunity for average people in places like Youngstown, Ohio.
And until we hit that chord over and over and over again, we`re never going to be able to compete. We`re not a real party now in the country. We`re a coastal party, where the majority of our votes come from the coasts. And we got wiped out in the Industrial Midwest. And we will never be a majority party if we continue down that road.
And that`s why I`m fighting as hard as I can to change it.
CAVUTO: All right, Congressman Ryan, thank you very, very much. Good catching up with you. Happy new year again.
RYAN: Thanks, Neil.
CAVUTO: All right.
RYAN: Happy new year.
CAVUTO: All right, Congressman Tim Ryan. Got to get that right. There`s a lot of Ryans there. All right."
0	53	 54 von 72	Fox News Network	January 3, 2017 Tuesday	 YOUR WORLD WITH NEIL CAVUTO	 4:17 PM EST		"NEIL CAVUTO, HOST: Meanwhile, there`s a Gallup poll out. And this one amazed me.
Fewer than half of Americans right now confident in president-elect Trump`s handling of an international crisis. And I was thinking to myself, how was that worded that so few are confident that he will handle an international crisis?
But, be that as it may, former U.K. opposition Nigel Farage isn`t buying it. 
So, those kind of questions are always loaded here and the media has a disdainful view, as you know, of the president-elect.
NIGEL FARAGE, FORMER U.K. INDEPENDENCE PARTY LEADER: Yes.
CAVUTO: But it`s his Achilles` heel. It came up in a lot of surveys that they worry whether he will be too volatile, too temperamental.
Do you think that`s a legitimate beef, with everything else, that Donald Trump should worry about that?
FARAGE: Well, firstly, these polls were conducted several weeks ago.
Secondly, the methodology is astonishing. It`s 1,000 people across the whole United States of America. So just 20 people in California were asked. How on earth can that be representative of American opinion?
And let`s be frank. What did Gallup get right? Did they get Brexit right? No. Did they get Trump coming through the primaries? Did they get Trump winning the presidency right? No.
So I don`t think we should take this too seriously. But even if those figures were try, I don`t think Donald Trump needs to worry too much about it. I think with every day that passes, he`s actually gaining in confidence. I think the news today from Ford, whatever the argumentation coming from them, it follows on from Carrier and other examples.
CAVUTO: Right. Right.
FARAGE: He`s been elected by a big swing that took place in the Midwest by people who want jobs. He`s going to produce that.
He`s been elected by people who want a stop to illegal immigration coming across the Mexican border. He must get to grips with that. And on the international scene, what I found really amusing about those polls were that, in the past, 76 percent thought that Bush and Obama were a safe pair of hands in terms of foreign policy.
And what did they give us? The Iraq War and the catastrophe of Libya. So, I don`t think Trump needs to worry about this. He should brush it aside. He has got to get on and do the job post-January 20. And I think if he does that, you will see some big shifts in public opinion.
CAVUTO: All right. So, I will put you on a maybe on this particular Gallup poll.
But, Nigel, you know, as a conservative, and you hear all of this stuff back and forth as to whether, you know, Donald Trump is going too far in what some call a populist pitch to save American jobs, which is always greeted favorably by American workers, who wouldn`t, but there are many conservatives that say, wait a minute here. You`re strong-arming American corporations.
And, ironically, it`s been coming from a lot of liberals, who say, them. This would be the same folks who would say and welcome jobs being saved. But what do you make of this conundrum for a lot of folks in our country, typical Republicans who are saying I don`t know how we should feel about this? He`s kind of guilting them, forcing them to do things they might not otherwise do.
You say?
FARAGE: Well, yes, and I suppose you could call it a form of economic nationalism, couldn`t you?
He says he wants America to come first. He`s saying he will use whatever presidential powers he has to apply pressure to these corporations.
And, yes, there are many traditional conservatives, free marketeers who don`t think government should really interfere at all in the economy.
All I would say is that argument may have been a good one way back in the days of Ronald Reagan. But we`re living where we are. We`re in 2017. And what people have seen are China and other countries hugely, Mexico, too, hugely undercutting America.
He`s going to put American workers first. That`s why people voted him in. And I think if he does it, frankly, he will be a hero.
CAVUTO: Nigel Farage, great seeing you. Happy new year.
FARAGE: Thank you, and to you.
CAVUTO: All right."
0	54	 55 von 72	Fox News Network	January 3, 2017 Tuesday	 YOUR WORLD WITH NEIL CAVUTO	 4:05 PM EST		"NEIL CAVUTO, HOST: Meanwhile, back to that interview I had with the CEO of Ford Motor Company on the FOX Business Network regarding this, well, quid pro quo agreement with Donald Trump.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
MARK FIELDS, CEO, FORD MOTOR COMPANY: Primarily, we did a couple of things.
One is, we`re investing $4.5 billion in electrified vehicles and producing and introducing 13 electrified vehicles over the next five years. And we announced today that we`re going to be producing two of these here in our facility in Flat Rock, Michigan, and investing $700 million, and creating 700 jobs. 
And the reason that we`re canceling the plant down in Mexico is primarily due to the fact that we were going to build our next generation focus there. We`re now going to build it in an existing plant in Mexico, because we have seen decreasing demand in North America for small cars. And we simply don`t need the capacity anymore.
CAVUTO: So this has nothing to do with all the criticism you got from Donald Trump?
FIELDS: Well, we`re doing this decision based on what is right for our business.
As we think about the investments here in Michigan, as you can imagine, Neil, we look at a lot of factors as we make those. One of the factors that we`re looking at is a more positive U.S. manufacturing business environment under president-elect Trump and some of the pro-growth policies that he said he`s going to pursue.
CAVUTO: By the way, did you talk to him about this thing?
FIELDS: And so this is a vote of confidence.
CAVUTO: I`m sorry.
Did you talk to him about this today?
FIELDS: We notified him this morning, as well as vice president-elect Pence, of the announcement that we were making today.
CAVUTO: And what did the president-elect say?
FIELDS: Well, they were very pleased that we were making these investments here in the United States and creating the 700 jobs, building on the 28,000 jobs that we have created over the last five years and the $12 billion that we invested in U.S. plants over the last five years. So, they were very pleased that we`re making this action.
CAVUTO: Mr. Fields, would you have done this if Donald Trump were not elected president?
FIELDS: Yes, absolutely.
I mean, we -- again, the cancellation of the plant in Mexico was just really looking at capacity requirements. And the investments here in Michigan are around building our high-tech products here and making Flat Rock one of our most advanced manufacturing facilities that we will have going forward.
CAVUTO: The president-elect has gone after your rival, General Motors, for making the Chevrolet Cruze sedan in Mexico, signaling a likelihood that there is going to be a showdown there over that.
What do you think of that?
FIELDS: Well, you know, I can`t really speak to that. I speak to the Ford business.
And when you look at our business, obviously, we`re a multinational, a global multinational. Our home is here in the U.S. We are the largest producer of vehicles here in the United States than any other automaker. We`re the largest employer of hourly workers. And about 80 percent of our sales here in the U.S. come from vehicles that are produced here in the U.S.
So we will have to see how some of the trade policies work themselves out. But we will engage very proactively with president-elect Trump and his administration, just as we have done with many administrations in the past.
CAVUTO: Sir, I know you said that you didn`t do this because Donald Trump was elected president. Nevertheless, this is something that he wanted to see, the kind of thing he wanted to see. Was there any quid pro quo in this? Did he promise -- I know this rush towards fuel economy requirements and rules that you said in the past can be too fast and onerous and expensive or all the automakers, Ford included, would ease up, or any other commitment on the part of currency manipulation for those against whom you compete?
FIELDS: Well, there was no quid pro quo, because there was no negotiation on this. We did these actions because it`s right for our business.
(CROSSTALK)
CAVUTO: But did he come back at you, sir? Did he say that, look, all right, I hear what you`re saying about currency manipulation. I hear what you`re saying about tough fuel economy rules. I will address that when I become president?
FIELDS: Well, clearly, he said that publicly. So, obviously, we`re looking at that. And that`s one of the factors that we put into place.
And, again, when we look at some of the tax and regulatory reforms that he`s been talking about, that gives us a lot of confidence. And this is a vote of confidence that he can deliver on those things.
CAVUTO: What do you think the way he went after your company, the way he went against General Motors, the way he went after Carrier to save what amounts to 800 or so jobs there?
We haven`t seen a president-elect, let alone a president, use that type of bully pulpit to try to get his way. Obviously, you argue that was not a strong-arm tactic in your making this decision today. But what do you think of that presidential policy?
FIELDS: Well, I think, you know, when you look at -- there`s nothing wrong, I think, with a president who is looking to make sure that there is a strong and vibrant U.S. economy.
I think we all share that vision and that hope and that reality going forward. In terms of some of the things that the president-elect said on the campaign trail about Ford, you know, clearly, we`re always going to be out there talking about the facts and making sure we lay those out, which we have, just as we`re doing today.
And we will continue to do that going forward.
(END VIDEOTAPE)
CAVUTO: All right. I will let you be the judge as to whether that might have been inspired by the election of Donald Trump and recognizing the new reality that there`s a new sheriff in town. In 2.5 weeks, he will be the new president of the United States."
0	55	 56 von 72	Fox News Network	January 3, 2017 Tuesday	 YOUR WORLD WITH NEIL CAVUTO	 4:01 PM EST		"NEIL CAVUTO, HOST: What we know on this first day of the 115th Congress as members are taking pictures with the new leader there, just again reaffirming his leadership role of speaker of the House, Paul Ryan, whether that Republican House might have moved a little bit too swiftly for Donald Trump`s liking, particularly on trying to rein in an Ethics Committee.
Donald Trump was tweeting all the while that this was not the time to be pursuing that as a leadoff agenda item. And sure enough, they bent to that pressure and decided maybe now is not the time to do that. 
Virginia Republican Congressman Dave Brat very familiar to all of you as the giant slayer that he was in taking down Eric Cantor, one of the early revolutionaries on Capitol Hill.
Congressman, good to have you. Happy new year.
REP. DAVE BRAT (R), VIRGINIA: Hey, Neil. Happy new year. Great to be with you.
CAVUTO: Same here.
What do you make of what happened with Donald Trump urging I guess you guys to sort of get your priorities straight? And sure enough some of your colleagues did just that by scrapping this Ethics Committee rule change. What do you make of it?
BRAT: Yes, I think that the press got out a little in advance and kind of made it sound like the Congress and the Republican Caucus was moving back on ethics.
And I don`t think that`s the case. There were some -- Goodlatte is a very fair guy, the head of Judiciary. And there`s been a few cases where we have used ethics to bludgeon folks on the Democratic side or the Republican side unfairly as a political weapon.
And so Goodlatte made a few moves to straighten up that so the process is fair. You have to name -- if you`re going to name someone for -- or accuse them, you have to sign up and put your name down, and so that there`s some credibility there. So, there were some good moves in there.
(CROSSTALK)
CAVUTO: I think what he was saying, though, Congressman, and you`re much more aware of this than I am, that fine, maybe, not a fine leadoff effort. There are many more important things to do.
BRAT: Right, right, and especially the messaging on it.
If you`re going to do it, you need to tell the American people in advance, hey, we`re going to make some move on ethics and get it right. There`s a little question about independence.
And so our leadership last night said, hey, we`re going to try to pull it back. And then Trump gave a little hint. And so now we`re moving on. We are going to have a nice bipartisan debate on ethics. I taught ethics for 20 years. And so it`s very important. Hopefully, the kids will learn a little something out of this and look up what the word means since we`re not teaching it in our K-12 schools right now. So, maybe a little bit good news.
CAVUTO: But it wasn`t an abandonment, it wasn`t the Republicans sending a message we`re not into doing the ethically right thing? That`s the way it was portrayed in the media, which is a little simplistic. But you are going to revisit that?
BRAT: Yes, yes, we just -- we pulled the amendment today. We`re going to study it in a bipartisan fashion, work with the other party.
CAVUTO: I got you.
BRAT: We will get it right.
And so we`re on to do a lot of great stuff. And the energy level is just so huge right now. I think that`s just a little blip right now.
CAVUTO: Yes.
You know what? One of the things that Donald Trump tweeted afterwards is maybe their number one act and priority, focus on tax reform, health care and so many other things of far greater importance. So would that include, now that issue is out of the way, communicating with him more? Because apparently no one ran this by the president-elect.
BRAT: Yes. No, that`s right. We all have to get on the same page.
And so every year we do an ethics package and a rules package. It`s par for the course. But if you have anything that can rock the boats or gets out there and upsets the messaging, we ought to coordinate that better.
And Trump really takes this thing seriously. He`s very good on the messaging and getting things to pop in the right order.
So, right. I heard your good news message today on the jobs coming back. And, obviously, that is the number one issue for Trump. And once we put the corporate rate reduction in there and repeal Obamacare coming up in a couple weeks, the American people will be happy again when they see the stock market go even higher.
CAVUTO: Yes, that`s what they want to see. A little bit on that in just a second.
BRAT: Yes.
CAVUTO: In the meantime, Congressman, thank you for taking the time.
BRAT: Thank you.

O`DONNELL: Well, for Republicans, the real worst news of the day of day one of the new Congress is not the ethics story.
We will get to that, but that`s not their biggest problem. That`s a problem they fix in less than 24 hours.
The biggest problem on this first real day of governing for Republicans in Congress has gone completely unnoticed until now.
But it will ruin Donald Trump`s first year as president.

STEVE KORNACKI, MSNBC: On day one of the new Congress, house Republicans think twice and throw out their plan to overhaul an ethics watch dog.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: The president-elect weighing in on the timing of that epic battle.
Saying, there are so many other things of far greater importance.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Why is this the most important thing for Congress to be focused on right now?
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It isn`t, that`s the whole thing, it`s not.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Don`t they realize what the election was about in November? It was about that Americans are sick and tired of what goes on in Washington.
So, this should not have been the first thing that people hear about.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The amendment that was adopted last night was withdrawn by unanimous --
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: The new Republican-led Congress is not wasting any time with their promise to repeal Obamacare.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Today, a bill to repeal Obamacare was introduced.
CHUCK TODD, MODERATOR, MEET THE PRESS: This time they have the votes and a president to sign the bill.
KELLYANNE CONWAY, REPUBLICAN CAMPAIGN STRATEGIST: There`s no question that there will be different health insurance coverage in this country under President Trump.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The Republicans in that repealing -- remember the whole pottery barn rule -- you break it, you own it.
Well, Republicans will end up owning everything that comes with healthcare.

O`DONNELL: In the history of American presidential campaigning, no winning candidate has ever made more impossible promises to his voters than Donald Trump did.
Some of those Trump promises were silly, some of them were unconstitutional, some of them were actually harmful.
To some of Donald Trump`s supporters, but they didn`t care. They cheered for all of them.

DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT-ELECT OF THE UNITED STATES: We`re going to build the ball, but who is going to pay for the wall? Hundred percent.

From day one I have been saying repeal and replace Obamacare. Real change begins with immediately repealing and replacing Obamacare.
(CHEERS)
(END VIDEO CLIP)
O`DONNELL: Today is the day that professional Republicans have been dreading.
And by professional Republicans, I`m only referring to those Republicans who draw a salary in government or politics and are professional enough to comprehend the demands of governing professionalism.
So that leaves out some Republican senators and most Republican members of the house.
It includes most of the committee chairs in both the House and the Senate and definitely includes the leadership teams in both the house and the senate.
All of those people understand legislative reality. The governing professionals in both parties always understand legislative reality much better than new presidents do.
Not since Lyndon Johnson have we had a presidential with real federal legislative experience.
And we have never had a president with less governing experience of any kind than Donald Trump.
None of the Republican pros in the Congress thought Donald Trump was going to win.
So they weren`t much worried but they would ever have to do what they did today -- face the reality of dealing with Donald Trump`s campaign promises.
Some of Donald Trump`s promises will just fade away, and not be missed by anyone, including by his supporters.
But no one in the Congress, and no Trump voter can forget the promise that Donald Trump made during the campaign that was identical to the promise that virtually every Republican in Congress has been making for years.

(CHEERS) TRUMP: We will terminate Obamacare and replace it, believe me, with something good.
(CHEERS)
(END VIDEO CLIP)
O`DONNELL: And today was day one of dealing with the reality of that promise and it was a very bad day for Republicans.
But luckily for the Republicans, the media has been distracted by the dust up over the ethics enforcement process in the House of Representatives.
Something we`ll talk about later. And no one has noticed just how bad a day it was for the professional Republicans whose job it is to make Donald Trump`s Obamacare repeal a legislative reality.
It could not have been more of a disaster. ""Reuters"" carried the headline today, ""U.S. Republican senator introduces Obamacare repeal resolution.""
I hate to pick on headline writers but in reality, that`s not exactly what happened today.
""Reuters"" wasn`t the only one to report that Republicans in the House and the Senate had a budget resolution ready to go on day one that repeals Obamacare.
Here is that budget resolution, 54 pages long. Obamacare is not mentioned in this resolution.
This is simply an outline of what Republicans hope will be the basic shape of the federal budget for the next ten years after they repeal Obamacare and implement Donald Trump`s giant tax cut.
Which is really just a version of the giant tax cut previously proposed by Paul Ryan.
You have to get all the way to the first line on page 3 of this resolution to see the first piece of the disaster that this resolution represents for the Republicans.
It says that ""the federal government`s revenue next year will be two trillion, six hundred and eighty two billion dollars.
Now, I know that`s a lot of money, but it is significantly less revenue than we are collecting now.
And that would be OK for the Republicans. In fact, it would be a big win for the Republicans cutting taxes, raising less revenue, a very Republican thing to do.
But as the very first line on the next page, page 4 shows the spending that the Republicans are proposing for 2017 is three trillion, three hundred and eight billion dollars.
And if you make it all the way to the first line in page 5 of the budget resolution, you will see that, that means Donald Trump`s first year as president, the Republicans will produce a deficit of $582 billion.
And spending will go up every year under the Republican budget. So, the ten years from now the deficit will be over a trillion dollars a year.
The Republicans are going to ask their members in the House and Senate to vote for a budget that increases the deficit every year and gets us to a trillion-dollar deficit ten years from now and the deficit just keeps going up after that.
And is anyone -- is anyone going to hate that more than Donald Trump?
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
TRUMP: We`re dying, we`re going to have $20 trillion in debt, $20 trillion. Obama-Clinton policies have doubled the national debt.
It took more than 230 years for the United States to accumulate its first $10 trillion in debt.
It took President Obama less than eight years to add another $10 trillion. We owe $20 trillion right now, doubled under Obama and we haven`t done anything.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
O`DONNELL: In his first year in office, Donald Trump is going to increase the national debt.
According to the budget outlined by Republicans today, he will continue to increase the national debt every year.
And so if he runs for re-election four years from now, you won`t hear a word from Donald Trump about the national debt.
And ten years from now, the national debt will be, thanks to Donald Trump and the Republicans, $10 trillion higher than it is now.
And that is written right into the budget resolution that they introduced today that`s been ignored.
They will have turned a $19 trillion national debt into a $29 trillion national debt and that is against everything that Donald Trump and the Republicans say they stand for.
That is the legislative and political disaster that Donald Trump and the Republicans face by being forced to do the math today for the very first time on Donald Trump`s promises and actually put that in writing in here, in this budget resolution.
Donald Trump and the Republicans like to say that the very first thing they`re going to do is repeal Obamacare.
But if it is the very first thing they are going to do, it is going to take them a very long time for them to do that very first thing.
This budget resolution will have to be voted on by both the House and the Senate.
But because there is nothing in this thing, except numbers, nothing about Obamacare, nothing about spending any money on infrastructure.
Nothing about spending money on building a wall with Mexico because none of that is here. Committees in the House and the Senate are going to have to write those details into another bill about exactly how they will reduce revenue.
How they will spend that government revenue, exactly what taxes they will cut, on exactly what programs will they increase spending, will they cut spending.
The repeal of Obamacare will have to be written into a completely separate piece of legislation, commonly referred to as a reconciliation bill which will then reconcile the numbers in this budget resolution.
Reconcile them with the actual legislative changes that achieve these promised numbers. Tax cuts that match the total amount of reduced revenue that the resolution calls for.
They will have to be legislated specifically. Spending increases in specific programs that end up matching the total spending increases outlined, and this resolution will have to be specifically legislated.
Budget resolutions like this, they don`t do anything. They are simply promises that Congress will do something.
Republicans now in the House and Senate do not know how to pass a reconciliation bill that fully delivers on the promises of a complex budget resolution like this one, because they never have.
They passed a functionally fake reconciliation bill in 2016 that President Obama vetoed three days later.
Some like Mitch McConnell have been around long enough to know how to pass a real reconciliation bill, but he`s never done it as a Senate leader.
Most Republican members of Congress have never seen it done. They have no idea how difficult it is.
When it`s done, well, it takes most of the year to do it, and during every minute of the year that the Republicans are trying to repeal Obamacare and to enact a gigantic tax cut.
They will be exposed to the political liability that is revealed here that they are voting to increase the national debt by $10 trillion.
In other words, they will be voting against what used to be their principles.
And unfortunately for the Republicans, even before they will be close to figuring out how to deliver on the promises in this budget resolution, they will be forced to vote to increase the debt ceiling on what will be the worst Saint Patrick`s Day of Donald Trump`s life.
Saint Patrick`s Day is bad enough for Donald Trump already with an endless stream of paraders clogging up in front of his front door on 5th Avenue.
But this year, it will be the day or maybe the day after, that he has signed his first increase in the debt ceiling, voted on by Republicans in Congress.
The current debt ceiling expires at 12:01 a.m. on March 16th. And so the first major crisis of the Trump presidency is officially scheduled for March 16th, day 55 of Donald Trump`s presidency.
He will do on that day what every president before him has done, when necessary, and raise the debt ceiling.
And when he does it, he will not be able to make any even vaguely realistic promises to his voters that the national debt will ever go down ever.
Because when he signs the increase in the debt ceiling, Donald Trump and the Republicans in Congress will still be trying to pass this resolution, this stunning increase in the national debt.
And by that time, the news media will have caught up with what`s in this resolution.
And so Donald Trump supporters will know by then, what is in this resolution. And by that time, the mechanisms for repealing Obamacare will probably not yet be written.
But the budgetary outline for the fiscal and political disaster of increasing the national debt by a trillion dollars a year will be right there, in print, for professional Republicans in Washington.
The weight of the Trump promises landed on them today. And despite all their smiles for the camera when taking their oaths of office for the new Congress, today was the worst day of their legislative lives.
And it only gets worse from here. Coming up, what will happen if the Republicans do manage to repeal Obamacare?
Steven Brill who wrote the definitive book on Obamacare joins us.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D), NEW YORK: They are like the dog who caught the boss. They don`t know what to do with it.
It has so many good things. Twenty million people covered. Twenty one to twenty six, you get on your parents plan.
Your parents would earn in a year, your child has cancer, they can`t deny you insurance. Women have to be treated the same, planned parenthood. All these things are very popular.
They say, oh, we`ll keep those but get rid of ACA, they can`t. And so, what do they do?
They say we`ll repeal it and two years from now we`ll tell you what we`ll replace it with.
Oh, they have nothing to replace.
MADDOW: But they do have --
(END VIDEO CLIP)
O`DONNELL: Joining us now is Steven Brill; journalist and author of ""America`s Bitter Pill: Money, Politics, Background Deals and the Fight to Fix Our Broken Healthcare System"".
Steven, talk about money, politics and background deals. The year that we have coming on putting together this budget reconciliation bill, in which the Obamacare repeal will live or die.
STEVEN BRILL, JOURNALIST & AUTHOR: Right --
O`DONNELL: That`s going to be another one of these years of back room deals.
BRILL: It is, except, I don`t think the deals are going to happen. I think we`re going to get to 2020 with the replacement still not there and maybe they`ll extend the time to get the replacement.
You know, it is sort of amazing, and you and I have talked about this that the law passed in 2010 from the moment it passed, they said it should be repealed or replaced.
They still don`t have their replacement and I`ll bet you right here that ten years after the law passed they will not have a replacement.
And the reason they won`t have a replacement is that Obamacare is the Republican health reform plan.
The Democrats tried all of their plans, they tried single payer. They`ve been trying plans since the Truman administration.
But the Clinton administration tried it and Obama finally gave up and said, all right, let`s do Mitt Romney`s heritage society Republican plan.
So, that`s why they don`t have an alternative plan because Obamacare is their plan.
O`DONNELL: Kellyanne Conway, which is -- it`s risky to even mention her because we know she doesn`t speak for Donald Trump, no one does.
But she did say today on ""MORNING JOE"", ""we don`t want anyone who currently has insurance to not have insurance.""
BRILL: Right --
O`DONNELL: So, not one person currently covered under Obamacare can lose their insurance and the only way to do that --
BRILL: Well --
O`DONNELL: Is to preserve Obamacare.
BRILL: OK, but here`s the problem, you are taking her literally as well as taking her seriously.
O`DONNELL: No, I`m taking her as saying something that they are saying --
BRILL: I --
O`DONNELL: And will not be able to live up to.
BRILL: Sure, but just like what you said about the debt, I guaranteed you that Donald Trump runs for president, and for re-election saying he`ll reduce the debt and he reduced the debt --
O`DONNELL: When it will have gone up by $4 trillion --
BRILL: Because that -- you know, that`s the real fake news we live in --
O`DONNELL: Yes --
BRILL: It`s the false equivalency of someone saying, well, actually the debt went up a little bit.
They will say that everybody is getting the same health insurance. They will say that Medicaid hasn`t been cut or Medicare hasn`t been cut.
But it`s up to the press really to dig into this stuff --
O`DONNELL: So he -- yes, so actually --
(CROSSTALK)
What you`re saying, he`d say something like Medicaid hasn`t been cut, we just put it back to the way it was --
BRILL: Yes, we --
O`DONNELL: Before Obamacare.
BRILL: Or which gave it to the state so the states can improve it and the states really know how to do this.
And they can raise the money to do it. We`re not cutting it.
O`DONNELL: So, you expect Donald Trump basically to lie his way around the negative outcomes of -- but what about the members of Congress? --
BRILL: I think -- I think with Kellyanne Conways --
O`DONNELL: Have to live with that --
BRILL: Of the world will see everybody has the opportunity to get the same or better insurance.
But if the states didn`t deliver on it or if the charitable organizations didn`t deliver on it, or if these high-risk plans we set up didn`t deliver on it, well, we`re still working on it, that`s not our fault.
O`DONNELL: But think about the Republican Senators who will be approached by the big hospitals, especially research hospitals --
BRILL: Exactly --
O`DONNELL: In their states, that they care about, and that they --
BRILL: Right --
O`DONNELL: Know they`re going to spend some time in themselves, at some point --
BRILL: Right --
O`DONNELL: In their lives --
BRILL: Right --
O`DONNELL: Which is one of the reasons they care about --
BRILL: Everybody cares about --
O`DONNELL: Them a lot --
BRILL: Hospitals --
O`DONNELL: Care about them a lot --
BRILL: For that reason --
O`DONNELL: I have seen the way hospitals --
BRILL: As you know --
O`DONNELL: Lobby in Washington and they are very effective. They`re going to come and say what you`re doing is going to kill us. It`s going to kill us --
BRILL: Yes --
O`DONNELL: And those people will not be able to come up with the kind of spin that Donald Trump does.
BRILL: Well, that`s right.
O`DONNELL: The people who have to vote on this.
BRILL: Remember, Obamacare passed because it pleased the hospital lobby, the medical device lobby, the drug lobby, the insurance lobby.
So, all of those interests are not going to let it be repealed easily. And it`s not going to be repealed.
It will be repealed on paper but I predict to you that there will not be anything different until least after the congressional elections and they`ll probably punt until after the presidential --
O`DONNELL: Yes, so, you`re betting that the best version of repeal they will do will be one of these things where they say we`ll repeal it with an effective date way down the line --
BRILL: I bet --
O`DONNELL: In the future --
BRILL: Yes, and we`re working on this plan and don`t worry it`s going to be great.
O`DONNELL: But then, the Republican voters who wanted this repeal really going to fall for that card trick?
That we repeal it today but it doesn`t take effect for several years? --
BRILL: They`re not going to fall for it. But I think the real danger is that the Democratic Party instead of having a meeting in Washington tomorrow or to meet in Kentucky and Ohio and see some of the people that I met when I was doing my book.
Who are Trump voters, who are really scared by this now, because they didn`t quite take him seriously.
But now they keep reading in the newspapers that this thing has been repealed.
And they lose on this. They lose big time. I`ll bet you that more people helped buy Obamacare voted for Trump than voted for Clinton.
O`DONNELL: The advantage of it being in a reconciliation bill is you only need 50 votes plus the vice president`s vote --
BRILL: Right --
O`DONNELL: In the United States Senate. The disadvantage is a reconciliation bill has so many things in it.
Including defense spending, all --
BRILL: Yes --
O`DONNELL: Sorts of spending in it.
BRILL: It`s a new --
(CROSSTALK)
But there`s a lot more reasons to object to it --
O`DONNELL: Yes --
BRILL: Than just Obamacare --
O`DONNELL: That`s right --
BRILL: It`s not a stand-alone bill. We`ve got to cut it there for tonight, we`re going to be talking about it all year. Steven Brill, thank you very much --
BRILL: Sure enough --
O`DONNELL: For joining us tonight, really appreciate it. Coming up, the gangster, the really bad guy who was with Donald Trump, he`s right there with Donald Trump on new year`s eve.
O`DONNELL: Throughout most of the history of the government of the United States, there has been no such thing as congressional ethics.
Meaning there was no real policing authority for congressional ethics.
When Congress moved to impeach President Richard Nixon in 1974, we had no idea how ethical or unethical the house members were who were conducting the president`s impeachment hearings because there were no house -- there was no House Ethics Committee.
There was no Senate Ethics Committee. The House Ethics Committee was invented three years after the Nixon impeachment hearings.
The Senate Ethics Committee was created a year after that. And so, all of the giants of the House of Representatives and the Senate throughout history that you`ve read about from John Adams who was in the House of course to Daniel Webster to Lyndon Johnson, Everett Dirksen.
They all lived in an ethics free zone. Since the ethics committees were invented, we have only become more and more concerned with congressional ethics.
And so, in 2008 when the Democrats controlled the House of Representatives, they created another layer, the Office of Congressional Ethics.
And yesterday Republicans tried to turn back the clock to 2007. They were smart enough not to get caught abolishing the Office of Congressional Ethics entirely.
But they did dramatically reduce its powers and its relevance in a secret vote conducted in a room full of Republicans last night with the door closed.
Paul Ryan and others in the leadership were opposed to this idea, but the Chairman of the Judiciary Committee Bob Goodlatte pushed for a vote and he won with a vote of 119 to 74.
And today, Republicans unanimously changed their minds and realized it was a very bad idea after hearing from some outraged Republican constituents and after this tweet from Donald Trump.
""With all the Congress has to work on, do they really have to make the weakening of the Independent Ethics watch dog as unfair as it may be, their number one act and priority?
Focus on tax reform, healthcare and so many other things of far greater importance.""
There is a possibility that Republicans were going to reverse themselves on this without the Trump tweet, but the Trump tweet certainly removes all doubt about it.
And the good news for Paul Ryan`s leadership in this story is that, after allowing the rebels to have their way last night, the rebels and their leader last night Chairman Goodlatte were humiliated today.
And the next time that the rebels or Bob Goodlatte tried to challenge the leadership of Paul Ryan, they`re all going to remember what happened this time.
Joining us now is Leo Wise; he was the first staff director and chief counsel of the Office of Congressional Ethics when it was first established.
Also joining us Julian Epstein; the former chief minority counsel of the House Judiciary Committee and a former majority staff director of the House Government Operations Committee.
Leo Wise, tell us what you feel the congressional -- why this new layer of policing of congressional ethics was necessary in 2008?
What was inadequate at that point or considered inadequate at that point about the House Ethics Committee?
LEO WISE, FORMER STAFF DIRECTOR & CHIEF COUNSEL, OFFICE OF CONGRESSIONAL ETHICS: Well, I think it was two things.
There was a sense that with the scandals related to Jack Abramoff and the members of Congress that were ensnared with him that the house wasn`t acting.
And these stories were playing out in the press, sometimes in the courts and it wasn`t clear if members were being held accountable in the institution where they served.
So, the Office of Congressional Ethics were set up to really throw sunlight onto the Ethics process and open a window that through which the public could see whether the institution was investigating these allegations and then making decisions about the facts once they were presented.
O`DONNELL: And what is the record of it so far? I mean, how many cases has it -- has it covered and reported on?
WISE: It`s covered and reported on dozens of cases in a non-partisan and professional way.
It declines to pursue cases more often than it pursues them. It weeds out unfounded accusations and then it puts together very robust fact records that are presented to the ethics committee.
And then ultimately to the public when these reports become public so the citizens everywhere can make their own judgments about their own elected officials and how the institution is holding them accountable.
O`DONNELL: Julian Epstein, one of the weaknesses of the congressional of ethics committee system both in the House and Senate is the inside secret anyway that no one wants to be on the ethics committee.
I`ve never known a member of Congress, House or Senate who wanted to be on the ethics committee.
Who wanted the job of investigating his or her colleagues. It is the most undesirable task in the building.
And you would think that the 2008 move, which in a certain sense, relieved the ethics committee in a certain kind of way.
You could look at it as it relieves the ethics committee of certain kinds of pressures, puts them in a place outside of member influence and maybe that would actually be a better life for the people on the ethics committee, who actually don`t want this burden.
JULIAN EPSTEIN, FORMER CHIEF MINORITY COUNSEL, HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE: Well, you would think that would be the point of view of most members, including most of the members who do pretty much engage very ethically in their --
O`DONNELL: Yes --
EPSTEIN: Day-to-day business --
O`DONNELL: Most wouldn`t do, absolutely, yes.
EPSTEIN: Most of them do, but there are several that don`t like this idea of an independent agency kind of monitoring them on ethics issues.
And I think Leo is exactly right. It wasn`t just a Jack Abramoff issue, it was the Mark Foley pedophilia scandal. And democrats came to power 2006 on the culture of corruption. In the Abramoff case we had 21 public officials that were convicted of bribery and like charges.
And the ethics committee kind of sat on the sidelines during the - during most of that process. So, it was a big embarrassment to the ethics committee. But just to further underscore Leo`s point, any effective investigatory agency like an inspector`s general has to have essentially three things. It`s going to have the ability to compel testimony, it`s got to have independence, independence in terms of when to initiate an investigation, when to refer an investigation or criminal procedures and it has to be able to use other tools like whistle-blowers.
The Office of Congressional Ethics already doesn`t have the most important of those three tools. It doesn`t have the ability to compel congressional testimony or documents. And what the republicans tried to do yesterday in an incredibly (INAUDIBLE) move that is going to have spillover effects for Donald Trump was that they tried to get rid of the other two essential things the Office of Congressional Ethics has.
The independence, the independence in terms of when to initiate investigation and when, if they find something that might be criminally wrong or ethically wrong, when they can refer you to congress or to a criminal prosecutor. The third -- so they don`t have the first, the ability to compel. The congressional republicans tried to take away the second, which is the independence and they tried to take away the third tool that the office needs, which is the ability to use tools like whistle- blowers.
So, it was an effective neutering of this agency and the republicans have now poked this hornets nest of ethics and they found out that there`s a huge grassroots movement in favor of draining the swamp, in favor of ethical conduct and this is going to have big spillover effects for Donald Trump right now who has a whole much bigger mess of ethics issues as we discussed last week on the show or two weeks ago on the show. He is getting payments from China, he`s got entanglement with Russian interest, he`s got - he`s been accused of promoting his daughter`s apparel business with the Japanese.
All of the issues with India, with Turkey going on down the line. So, this has had, you know -- this has been a very, very revealing thing that will have very significant spillover effects for Donald Trump.
O`DONNELL: Leo Wise. Quickly. before we go, were you aware of a ground swell among republicans of this kind of complaint that they wanted to weaken it?
WISE: No. I mean when I was there, there wasn`t anything like that. You know, the office did its job. It did it professionally and in a nonpartisan way. There were certain members that were unhappy that their conduct was being questioned but at the end of the day, facts are facts. And what this attempted to do was make those facts not known. Didn`t change anybody`s conduct but to take away the ability to see what people were doing and then to hold them accountable.
O`DONNELL: Leo Wise and Julian Epstein, thank you both for joining us. Appreciate it.
EPSTEIN: Thank you Lawrence.
WISE: Thank you.
O`DONNELL: Coming up, we have some breaking news, Donald Trump tweeted about an intelligence briefing tonight and immediately intelligence officials said that the Donald Trump tweet is not true.
O`DONNELL: Tonight`s breaking news, Donald Trump tweeted this little earlier tonight. ""The intelligence briefing on so-called Russian hacking was delayed until Friday. Perhaps more time needed to build a case. Very strange."" NBC`s Ken Dilanian is reporting that a senior intelligence official says that the briefing with CIA, NSA and FBI heads has always been scheduled for Friday. The early report that the briefing was to occur Wednesday apparently was wrong.
The intelligence chiefs were not scheduled to be in New York City on Wednesday. The senior intelligence official called Trump tweet disturbing and adversarial. He added he is calling out the men and women of the intelligence community the way he called out Lockheed and Boeing but these are public servants. Donald trump will learn more he says about Russia hacking from the McCain hearing which is scheduled for Thursday.
Also today the confirmation hearing for Rex Tillerson as Secretary Of State was set for January 11th, where he will face questions about his ties with Vladimir Putin, Foreign Relations Chairman Bob Corker says that Tillerson does not have to turn over his tax returns as the foreign relations committee does not usually get tax returns from secretary of state nominees. Joining us now David Corn Washington bureau chief for Mother Jones and an MSNBC political analyst.
Also with us Elise Jordan former senior policy advisor to Senator Rand Paul`s presidential campaign and an MSNBC political analyst. Elise to the breaking news of the night, Donald Trump, first of all, apparently getting it wrong that there ever was a Wednesday scheduled meeting, but then using the fact that this meeting is now Friday tries to use that to attack the integrity of the intelligence services that will be reporting to him.
ELISE JORDAN, FMR. SR. ADVISOR, RAND PAUL CAMPAIGN: He`s going to war with our intelligence agencies and I think it is really disturbing. I think that if he has problems with their analysis, if he wants to go in, approach the organization with skepticism that is his agenda but he should do it behind closed doors. Any problems that he has with the analysis it doesn`t need to be aired to the world. It hurts our spy craft and it is irresponsible and puts our men and women abroad their mission in question I think.
I think it`s really troubling the way this has been unfolding.
O`DONNELL: And David Corn it`s that phrase we get used to, we`ve never seen anything like it. And what`s so fascinating about it, is he puts himself in a direct, and unnecessary battle with the head of the FBI, head of CIA, head of NSA, no reason to have this battle.
DAVID CORN, CHIEF OF THE WASHINGTON BUREAU FOR MOTHER JONES: Well, one of your great producers on the show just said to me, it`s amazing, isn`t it? And I said actually at this point it`s not amazing. And I think we have to get used to the fact that Donald Trump says things and tweet things that are more often false than not. That show that he is impulsive, he could have easily checked with his scheduler and said, was it Wednesday, Friday?
Why did they move but then he attributes the darkest motives to it when he has no reason to. We do know he is sort of -- has a liking for conspiracy theories and just like yesterday, or the day before when he said, you know, what I know something about hacking that you don`t know and I might tell you on Tuesday maybe Wednesday. Well you know what that`s not going to happen either. So you have a guy who`s a serial fabricator who is adversarial basically everything, but most of all to the truth.
O`DONNELL: And Elise, what he doesn`t seem to understand and apparently no one who has any influence over his tweeting understands is how confirmation hearings work. Everything is relevant in confirmation hearing. When Tillerson has his hearing for Secretary of State he is going to be asked, as I suggested on twitter this weekend, did you advise Donald Trump on this tweet when he said "" great move on delay by V. Putin. I always knew he was very smart."" Can we get that tweet up on the screen?
That one, that went up on - over the New Year`s weekend. Did you advise Donald Trump on that tweet will be question one, question two, when he says no which he better say, do you agree with that tweet. It`s going to be impossible for Donald Trump`s secretary of state to agree with that tweet or what he tweeted tonight.
JORDAN: Well that`s why what he is doing right now makes no sense because he is making it more complicated for his own nominees that he wants to sail through their confirmation hearings. Right now this situation is so politicized. I personally think that there needs to be some evidence, if the charges are as serious as what the intelligence community has suggested. I think that it might be a time that we reveal some of our sourcing that we actually show evidence and make the case, if it is what they say.
If not, it has been over-politicized and Donald Trump is partially to blame for that because of his posture towards Putin. He needs to stop acting so juvenile over twitter and saying I want to be -- he previously said he wanted to be best friends with Putin. You know, just recently he was calling him very smart. It`s just - it`s unnecessary and while we need to have a strong relationship with Russia we need to project strength and right now not what he is showing is weakness.
O`DONNELL: And David Corn Rex Tillerson should be also be asked on January 11th, do you believe Donald Trump or do you believe the director of the FBI, the CIA that they were not scheduled for Wednesday, they were scheduled for Friday? And also do you believe the implied corruption about their agencies in Donald Trump`s tweet?
CORN: Yes. Do you take at face value the intelligence of establishment judgment that Russia hacked, meddled in our elections? Do you believe that or not? Or do you believe what Donald Trump and his supporters are saying that it`s all trumped up and made up? That question should be put to Mike Pompeo who is going to be head of the CIA. Elise is a hundred percent right that this is causing trouble for Trump and his nominees but it just gets to the basic problem here.
The guy is impulsive. He doesn`t think before he tweets. He doesn`t check. And as we`ve seen time and time again, his aides have no idea what he is doing. As a guy who is in charge of the nuke - or who will be in charge of the nuclear arsenal in a pretty dangerous world in which things can go wrong very quickly, this is probably the most worrisome thing about the Trump presidency.
O`DONNELL: If senate staffers on the confirmation committees still know what they are doing and how to do this, they should be writing questions tonight using Donald Trump`s tweets. Elise Jordan and David Corn, thank you both for joining us tonight. Really appreciate it.
JORDAN: Thank you.
CORN: Thank you.
O`DONNELL: Coming up, Donald Trump says he will hold a press conference next week. It is the same press conference that he promised to have last month. And how about this for a first question, why did you spend New Year`s Eve with a known felon and mob associate?
O`DONNELL: Donald Trump has once again promised a press conference for next week which does not mean he`s going to have a press conference next week. But if he does he should be asked to explain what he was doing with Joey No Socks on new Year`s Eve. The felon and mob associate standing next to him right there. That`s next.
O`DONNELL: Donald Trump once again rescheduled his long awaited news conference on how he will avoid conflicts of interest with his businesses. Tweeting tonight, he said I will be having a general news conference on January 11th in NYC. Thank You. This new conference will come just one day after President Obama`s farewell address in Chicago next week. Among the many questions Donald Trump might have to answer during that news conference is why he spent his New Year`s Eve with this guy -- Joseph Cinque also known as Joey No Socks, a convicted felon with mob ties.
Joseph Cinque runs the American Academy of Hospitality Sciences which gives out star diamond awards in hospitality and has given multiple awards to Trump`s hotels, golf courses and restaurants. In May 2015 Donald Trump was even listed as the Ambassador extraordinaire for Cinque `s company. But just one year later, when the associated press asked Donald Trump about his ties to Joey No Socks, Donald Trump denied knowing him well, saying if a guy is going to give you an award you take it. You don`t tend to look up his whole life story. Joining us David Cay Johnston, Pulitzer prize winning journalist who founded d.c. report.org, a non profit news organization that will cover the Trump Administration and has looked up Donald Trump`s life story and Joey No Socks life story. David, tell us what we need to know about this guy.
DAVID CAY JOHNSTON, JOURNALIST: Well Joey No Socks decided to change his life a bit and go in to the business of selling awards with Donald Trump on his board at one time and his board at a majority of either Trump family members or retainers after a hit on him that failed. And he is one of many --
O`DONNELL: Whoa, whoa, you mean an attempted murder of Joey No Socks?
JOHNSTON: Oh yes.
O`DONNELL: And so that`s what got Joey No Socks to think I should be in a less dangerous line of work?
JOHNSTON: Exactly, exactly and so art thievery and selling clothing out of Central Park South apartment and when he decided to hang out with Muffet and Biff, he also decided to take up loafers without socks. But he is one, Lawrence, of a number of mob-connected people. Donald was posing a week ago with Don King, who stomped to death one of his employees over a $600 dispute in the `60s. Now he was pardoned later but the fact is he killed the man.
We don`t know what other connections Donald has. In this case, it was so brazen, Joey No Socks has been coming to the Mar-A-Lago Christmas Eve party or New Year`s eve party every year by his account for more than decade. Donald Trump doesn`t know who he is. He was with him in Scotland. Donald doesn`t know who he is. That`s nonsense. Of course Donald knows who he is. But unlike everybody else he doesn`t do background checks when he doesn`t want to know about him. That`s how Felix Sater the son of the refuted - son of the Russian mob boss in New York ends up working closely with Donald and traveling all over with him an then Donald said wouldn`t know if he was in the same room. Donald just makes the stuff up and journalists are not holding him accountable
O`DONNELL: All right, quick break. We`re going to be right back with David on why Donald Trump kicked someone off of his golf course last week. Someone Donald Trump knows very well.
O`DONNELL: Harry Hurt III a Trump biographer told MSNBC tonight about Donald Trump kicking him off a Trump golf course over the holiday weekend.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
HARRY HURT III TRUMP BIOGRAPHER: And I went up to him and I simply said congratulations sir. I tipped my hat. I extended my hand. We shook hands and then he went into a exploitive filled (INAUDIBLE) tribe about the content of my book. He then said that he thought it was inappropriate for me to be playing at golf course. And he asked me to leave and I said that I would.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
O`DONNELL: Up next David Cay Johnston will tell us exactly what Donald Trump hates about Harry Hurt.
O`DONNELL: We`re back with David Cay Johnston. So David, why did Donald Trump kick Harry Hurt off of his golf course this weekend? He wrote a book about Donald Trump and I guess Donald Trump doesn`t like most of the books you people have written about him and I guest you`d probably run the same risk if he saw you on one of the Trump golf course.
JOHNSTON: Well Trump was actually very cordial to Harry just before he announced he was running for President when they ran in to each other at the same course. But Donald doesn`t like Harry`s book because Harry is the one who in his meticulously careful reporting revealed that Ivana Trump said that her husband roughed her up and raped her. Donald`s lawyer said you can`t rape your wife in New York. That`s not true. We have marital rape in New York. He dug up a lot of other very unsavory facts from the public record he has gone through and Donald of course doesn`t want you to know about that. He doesn`t want you to know that he had a fight with Marla where the doors were knocked off the hinges of their hotel suite, knocked of the hinges and other things that Harry documented carefully, thoroughly and accurately.
O`DONNELL: And so I was - I thought well I kind of understand why Trump would go after him but what surprises me is he had a pleasant encounter with Trump at the beginning of the campaign.
JOHNSTON: Because back then, Donald needed to start his calm and hide his vindictiveness. And now that he`s won the election you`re going to see this vindictiveness come out. Remember Donald is a man who said he gets pleasure from destroying the lives of other people. You refuse a favor for him he will go out of his way to destroy your life. You say something on daytime television like Rosie O`Donnell did and he will attack you in public in forum after forum. Donald is petty. He`s vindictive. This is a good example and we will see more of this.
O`DONNELL: David Cay Johnston who wrote one of the books on Donald Trump. Thank you very much for joining us tonight, really appreciate.
JOHNSTON: Thank you.
O`DONNELL: MSNBC`s live coverage continues into ""THE 11TH HOUR"". That`s next."
0	57	 58 von 72	MSNBC	January 3, 2017 Tuesday	 THE RACHEL MADDOW SHOW	 9:00 PM EST	"HIGHLIGHT: Senator Minority Leader Chuck Schumer talked with Rachel Maddow about his expectations for the difficulties Republicans will have making good on their promise to repeal the Affordable Care Act, both from Democrats and within their own party, about how ideologues are manipulating Donald Trump, and the error of Trump antagonizing U.S. intelligence agencies, about the Senate Republicans` radical refusal to allow President Obama to name a Supreme Court justice, and how Democrats plan to treat Donald Trump`s nominee, about Donald Trump`s antagonistic tweeting at U.S. intelligence agencies over evidence of Russian hacking, and about how Democrats in the Senate intend to stand up to Donald Trump`s agenda and exploit Republicans` internal divisions. Senator Bernie Sanders talked with Rachel Maddow about how Democrats plan to mobilize Americans across the country in opposition to the Donald Trump agenda where it conflicts with popular American values, and about how most Americans do not subscribe to Republican ideology, and how Democrats how to mobilize popular support against the Republican agenda.

"	"RACHEL MADDOW, MSNBC ANCHOR: Good evening, Ari. Exciting night. A lot of news breaking tonight. It`s good to be here.
Thanks to you at home as well for joining this hour.
We have a big show tonight. In addition to lots of developing and breaking news over the course of this evening, we`ve got a couple of really big live interviews in store this hour. That is why I am here in Washington, D.C. instead of our usual studio in New York. But it`s good to have you with us.
If you were her, would you go? Would you go to the inauguration?
Today, Hillary Clinton and former President Bill Clinton announced that they will attend the inauguration of incoming President Donald Trump later this month. I don`t know if they sought assurances from the new president that he wouldn`t actually lock her up if she shows up in Washington for his inauguration, but she will be there in person. If he wants to do his traditional thing where he leads his supporters in the lock her up chant, she will be there in person to hear it. 
That was news today that the Clintons will both be there. We already knew that former President Jimmy Carter and his wife Rosalynn will be there at the inauguration as well. But before today, that was the only former president we knew was coming. At the same time today that we learned Bill and Hillary Clinton will be attending the inauguration, we also learned that former President George W. Bush and his wife Laura, they, too, will attend the Trump inauguration later this month. Both the George W. Bush family and the Hillary Clinton family, both of those had been up in the air before today. But now we know both the Clintons and the George W. Bushes are going to be there.
We also have confirmation now that former President Bush, George H.W. Bush, he and his wife Barbara will not be attending the Trump inauguration, and you can read anything into that you want but honestly, the former president is now 92, their decision not to go to the inauguration appears to be nothing more than a health and age-based decision. It doesn`t appear to be any coded political message.
On this date in 1972, on January 3rd, 1972, ""New York"" magazine ran an article titled ""New York`s most overrated people."" And George H.W. Bush was living in New York at that time because he was the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, so he had to live in New York and George H.W. Bush in that article, 1972, he made the sad list, ""New York"" magazine calling him ""overrated.""
But George H.W. Bush, he responded to that in the world`s most perfect way -- he threw a party at the U.N. ambassador`s residence for everybody else on the list. He invited the 10 most overrated men in New York and he threw a party for them. And I`m sorry, but that is enough to make you like George H.W. Bush whether or not you liked him as a president.
One of the other guys who made that list that year, the most overrated list, was Gabe Pressman. Gabe Pressman was a TV reporter at the time at WNBC. After that article came out calling him overrated, he got this note from the U.N. ambassador at this time. He got this note from George H.W. Bush inviting them to the party he was going to throw.
And the note from George H.W. Bush, to this reporter, it said, in terms of being one of the most overrated men in New York City, it said, quote, ""I was lucky, but you earned it.""
(LAUGHTER)
And then he invited him to his house for the party, for all the people who were considered to be overrated in New York City. Apparently, he also invited the author of the article. God bless George H.W. Bush.
And God bless Gabe Pressman, the reporter. Gabe pressman is now also 92 years old and, I kid you not, he`s still reporting.
One of the privileges of working at NBC is that you occasionally still see Gabe Pressman around the halls because he`s still at work. He`s one of these guys who has been around since the dawn of TV reporting.
His first job as a reporter was in 1949. He has seen everything. He has been everywhere. He has done everything. He has spoken to everyone.
And tonight, turns out, it is newly newsworthy to remember the moment in Gabe Pressman`s long, long career when he was moderating a debate in a particularly pungent, particularly consequential election. And in so doing, in being the moderator of that debate, that meant he had to explain, during the debate, on live television, the meaning of the word ""putz."" And he did it expertly and nobody laughed. There was one little laugh.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
GABE PRESSMAN, JOURNALIST: The latest issue that you brought up, Congressman, involves a Yiddish slang word that you, Senator D`Amato, used to describe Congressman Schumer in a private meeting. We all agree on that, right? The specific charge is that you called him a Putzhead.
And for those not familiar with Yiddish, I read an excerpt from the Rosten dictionary of Yiddish, putz he says is, one, a term of contempt for a ass, fool, or jerk, or two a term for a simpleton or yokel, an easy mark. It literally means the male sex organ but that`s rarely used. This is according to Rosten, the authority on Yiddish.
So, it gets down to one simple issue. Did you use the word to describe your opponent?
THEN-SEN. AL D`AMATO (R), NEW YORK: Yes, I did and I used it in the context of being silly and foolish.
PRESS: Did you mean it as a term of contempt for your opponent?
D`AMATO: A term of foolishness.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
MADDOW: Yes, I did. I did call him a Putzhead.
Political debates are always good, but they are rarely this specific kind of challenge for the moderator to keep a straight face.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
SEN. CHARLES SCHUMER (D), NEW YORK: The statement he made -- yes, it`s a slur, it`s a vulgarism, it doesn`t bother me. That is not the issue.
PRESSMAN: Have you ever called anyone a putz yourself?
SCHUMER: I may have, but I tell you something, I wouldn`t lie about it.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
MADDOW: That was 1998.
SCHUMER: He lied about it.
MADDOW: He did lie about it. That was the issue.
1998, the incumbent senator from New York was a Republican, he`d already been elected three times, he was running for a fourth term and along came this feisty Democrat challenging him for his seat and that Democrat was so aggressive, he raised so much money, he went after Senator Al D`Amato so relentlessly that honestly it drove the senator to distraction.
He`s a three-term senator that everyone thought was so tough but he lost it. He calmed his opponent a Putzhead at a public meeting, and he called him other things beside, and he did lie about it, and his Democratic challenger got it on the record, nailed him with it to the point where he was answering for it in the debates.
That incumbent senator didn`t know what hit him. I mean, incumbents, especially rich, high-profile incumbents, they should be basically unbeatable in big expensive statewide races in places like New York. But along came this guy who was basically just made to win a race like that.
He`d been elected to the state assembly at the age of 23. He`d been elected to Congress at the ripe old age of 29. He had never lost an election in his life and he took on and beat this entrenched rich incumbent senator.
It was the highest profile Senate race in the country that year, mostly because of how hard that young congressman fought to get that seat. And he got that seat. And if you look -- it`s funny, look at the map of the race results that year, it doesn`t much look like the Democrat won but he did, he won by just under a half million votes.
But that was his first election to the Senate. It was the upset of a sitting incumbent Republican. Now put that map on the left and then look at -- that other map there on the right? That`s six years later.
Look what happened six years later when he had to run for reelection for the first time. Yeah, that one you can tell it`s not close. And you know, he`s still never lost an election. He got his seat in Washington with a campaign still famous 20 years later for its ferocity, and he turned that upset first win into just a dominant political position.
And then he put it to work for other Democrats, he got into the leadership and he stayed there. He became head of the part of the Democratic Party that works to elect Democratic senators. In his first election cycle as head of the Democrats` Senate prospects, all of these Democratic challengers took seats from all of those Republican incumbents. All those yellow check marks there are on Democratic heads. All those Republican incumbents lost to Democrats. That was his first cycle in charge of the Democrats picking up Senate seats.
Then in the next election cycle, he did it again. Five Democratic challengers unseated five more Republican incumbents in the Senate. Plus, the Democrats picked up three more open seats that year besides.
He fought tooth and nail in that first election with the Yiddish insults and everything. He fought tooth and nail to get into Washington. But once he was there he got 14 more Democrats into the Senate alongside him. And now, as of today, as of tonight, he will be the most powerful Democrat in Washington in the era of Donald Trump. The new Congress starts today and Chuck Schumer will be the leader of the Democratic Party in the one house in Congress where the minority party has some power.
And I will just say one thing before I bring him into this conversation -- it is inarguable that Democrats feel thunder struck by this past election. But that is mostly because this election result was a surprise. I mean, compared to 2008, the last time the White House flipped from one party to the other, 2008, the Senate Democrats earned so many seats with Chuck Schumer heading their Senate campaign arm for two cycles that newly elected President Obama in 2008, he came in with not just a majority in the Senate, he had a super majority, 60 Senate seats and the House was Democratic, too, and the new president won the election by a huge margin and he was riding a huge wave of popularity.
Now, that was a head of steam in 2008. In contrast, the Republicans right now, yes, they are coming in with a new Republican president, but they just lost seats in both houses of Congress. They`ve only got two-seat majority in the Senate. Their new president has the lowest approval ratings of any president-elect in the modern era and their incoming president -- incidentally, I know it`s a sore spot -- he lost the popular vote by more votes than any incoming president ever in the history of this country.
And so, Democrats are thunder struck that they lost, but they`re not exactly starting from scratch here. And the new guy taking charge for them on Capitol Hill has a history of winning uphill political battles, even when they get ugly to the point of being funny in retrospect.
Joining us now in his first interview since becoming minority leader in the Senate is Senator Chuck Schumer.
Senator, it`s nice to see you.
SCHUMER: Rachel, great to be here.
MADDOW: That was a little ""this is your life.""
SCHUMER: That was -- yes, I remember that well.
One interesting thought. So, D`amato came out and it was reported he called me this name, putzhead. He said, ""I never would, I don`t lie."" and his slogan against me ""too liberal for too long."" We came back at one with him which we used the whole campaign ""too many lies for too long."" and he comes out of here and denies it and guess who pulls out the rug from under him?
Ed Koch who was totally on D`Amato`s side. He was mad at me because when he ran against Dinkins I didn`t support him because I thought New York was a racial tinderbox and Ed Koch was throwing matches on the flame. Yet, Ed Koch can said, ""I cannot tell a lie. He said it."" And that was that.
MADDOW: So, I think a lot of people don`t know your back story about how you -- first of all that you started getting elected to office when you were so young, that you never lost an election, you upset this incumbent to get there. But should we -- are there extrapolatable things that you learned from the way that you started and the way that you started winning that apply to what`s going on with the Democrats right now?
SCHUMER: All through the years my lodestar -- I`ve always been a middle- class guy, I came from a middle-class neighborhood. My father was an exterminator, didn`t go to college. I grew up with people who were firefighters and store owners and teachers of all different ethnicities. That`s what happens in Brooklyn.
But I learned you have to be true to yourself. You have to have an internal gyroscope that directs you and the higher up you go, the more fierce the winds blow and the only way you don`t get blown off the mountain is by believing in things and believing in them without worrying about what people think.
That`s who I`ve been, you know? That`s who I`ve always been. I have focused on average folks. I care about them. I believe in them. I still identify and empathize with them and that`s what I tell candidates -- be yourself.
MADDOW: And you have been in public life and in national life for a long time.
SCHUMER: Yes, I tell people I`m from Brooklyn. Sometimes it helps me, sometimes it hurts me, but I know one thing -- I`d be less than whatever I am if I tried not to be from Brooklyn.
MADDOW: Because you have a Brooklyn accent, you are from Brooklyn, you have come up from New York politics, people think of you as a New York political figure. But now, indubitably, you are a national political figure and I think a lot of Democrats having been through the Sanders versus Clinton primary, having been through the shock of losing this election, are sort of trying to figure out how to place you and trying to think about what your leadership is going to be like at a national level.
Do you see yourself as a moderate? Do you see yourself as a liberal? Do you see yourself as ideological at all?
SCHUMER: Yes, I see myself as somebody who will fight really hard for the middle-class and people trying to be there and not be afraid. I am not afraid of Donald Trump. I am not afraid of the Republicans. And we`re going to hold their feet to the fire.
I am actually excited about this opportunity. It`s an opportunity. They - - there are so many contradictions in this administration.
I mean, one, we`re going after their nominees. McConnell wanted to let all of them get just through in these quick little two-hour hearings. Get all of them done in two weeks. We`re saying no way.
Price, the guy from HHS, Donald Trump said when he campaigned he wouldn`t cut Medicare and Social Security, but he turns around nominates as his HHS secretary, guy made his career on cutting Medicare and Medicaid. We`re going to slam him on these things.
He said he`s going to clean the swamp. Who`s his cabinet? Billionaires, people who own huge businesses, people who have been part of that swamp for a very long time. In other words, there was a certain populism -- you say can a lot of things about Donald Trump and I worked really hard against him, but he had a certain populism to him, a false populism but a populism.
He now has sold out to the hard right -- the pro-business, pro-corporate, pro-elite group. And I think we can really nail him on this. We can be very strong and unflinching and hold his feet to the fire. The theme of the speech I gave today is, we`re going to hold him accountable.
MADDOW: You talked about this being an accountability Congress.
SCHUMER: Right.
MADDOW: There was also on the other side of Capitol Hill, there was a weird start to the Congress and --
SCHUMER: But that`s who they are. You see these hard right people who are ideologues on the hard right, they don`t get it. So, how could it dawn on them that the first thing they should do is undo an ethics law? Crazy.
Now, they had to back off but still. That was their opening. We are going to have so many opportunities.
Here`s a great one. I mean, it`s very important to me, ACA.
MADDOW: Obamacare.
SCHUMER: They`re like the dog who caught the bus. They don`t know what to do with it. It has so many good things, 20 million people covered. You`re 21 to 26, you get on your parents` plan. You`re a parent, your child has cancer, they can`t deny you insurance. Women have to be treated the same. Planned Parenthood. All these things are very popular.
They say, ""Oh, we`ll keep those but get rid of ACA."" They can`t. And so, what do they do, they say, ""We`ll repeal it and two years from now, we`ll tell you what we`ll replace it with."" Bull. They have nothing to replace it with it.
MADDOW: But they have the votes to repeal it. I mean, they filed the legislation in the Senate to start repealing it today.
SCHUMER: They do because they`ve used this reconciliation process. Every Democrat will vote against them, and when they actually try to repeal it, but try to keep -- they have two choices, neither one is a winner for them.
They either try to keep the benefits, that means they have to put in a whole lot of money. You know what happens then? The right wing, the hard right guy says, we`re not paying money for this, to help poor people? To help people get health care? Forget it.
Or they cut out the benefits and there`s an outcry and even now, they can do this repeal and say we`ll replace in the two years. Guess who`s getting hurt? Workers, but hospitals, and rural hospitals. So you go to the reddest of states and who`s complaining the most? These little hospitals, rural, that depend on the ACA.
MADDOW: Are you saying that outcry is going to stop them from repealing it?
SCHUMER: I am saying by the time they get up to having to actually put a repeal bill in, they`re going to be so tied in a knot, they may not be able to do it.
MADDOW: Do you --
SCHUMER: We`re not going to help them.
MADDOW: Yes.
SCHUMER: So, they`re going to have to get all the votes themselves and the more their mainstream ones will say, we have to keep the benefits. Their more right wing ones will say, we can`t put in any money and they`re stuck.
MADDOW: Do you think that they will -- I believe they will not be able to replace.
SCHUMER: Yes.
MADDOW: But I don`t believe you that they won`t be able to repeal it.
SCHUMER: Well, they`ll repeal two years from now but there will be chaos. We will tell America that they`re replacing affordable care with chaos and once the chaos starts hitting the fan, I don`t know what they`re going to do. No, they`re going to repeal because they`re ideologues, they hit government. So this is the worst thing that could have happened to America, that government expanded in a major and significant way.
But they don`t have anything to put in the its place and when the chaos evolves, what are they going to do? They`re going to be stuck.
Same thing with the cabinet. Now, we are demanding hearings. First, we`re demanding everyone get an ethics investigation, that they all file these plans that they`re supposed to file, all the Obama nominees did on how they`re going to get rid of all their potential conflict of interest, all the businesses and stocks and things like that that they have. And they get an FBI background check. OK.
MADDOW: Can you force those things?
SCHUMER: We can force the first two. And if they don`t do them we can demand -- we can`t influence when they have the hearings. The original plan was to have eight or ten hearings the first week. But we can hold them up on the floor and for two months, that`s all they`ll do as their nominations. And so, they`re sort of stuck there, too.
And what we`re demanding is so reasonable. We call it the rigged cabinet. It`s not the kind of cabinet that represents America. It represents wealthy people, it represents a load of the people from the swamp and people who had views that are so out of the mainstream and Donald Trump didn`t campaign on most of these things.
MADDOW: The new -- excuse me. The new leader of the Democrats in the Senate as of today is Senator Chuck Schumer. We have him here tonight. I`m not going to let him leave.
We`ll be right back with you, Senator, in just a moment.
SCHUMER: My pleasure.
MADDOW: Stay with us.
MADDOW: Joining us again is the brand new Democratic leader of the United States Senate, Senator Schumer.
Senator Schumer, thank you very much for sticking with us.
I want to ask you about the last person who was in a position like yours. After Barack Obama got elected, Mitch McConnell was in your position and he basically bucked political science. He did an experiment.
Take on a very popular president who has a very popular agenda, make every effort to block that agenda without any regard for the polls and just sit back and wait for the voters to punish the governing party and reward you for being obstructionist. It seemed crazy and almost outrageous at the time to people observing in the moment, but it worked like a charm for his party.
SCHUMER: Yes.
MADDOW: You are not planning to borrow that playbook, though?
SCHUMER: Well, we are going to be tough. But, you know, and Bernie and Elizabeth agree with me on this. Let`s say he proposes -- as he said he would -- a trillion dollar infrastructure bill, you know, a grand public works bill.
Now, we Democrats always believed it. Bernie campaigned on it. But you have to look at the details. We`re not going to just go for anything he proposes. It`s going to have to be our bill.
So, for instance, they said we`ll do it with tax breaks. You can`t build roads and bridges with tax breaks unless you put huge tolls on them that no one can afford to pay back the bonds.
Let`s say they try to get rid of environmental protections and labor protections. Forget it.
So, do we say no absolutely on the first day, or another one where I tend to agree more with Trump than I did with Obama and Bush, trade. I think free trade has been a loser. I voted against NAFTA back in 1994.
And if he comes up with a really good trade position, we`re not going to just necessarily say no, but we`re going to hold his feet to the fire and I can assure you of this -- anything we`re going to support will get almost no Republican votes. That may mean we support them on nothing. But we`re not going to sacrifice our principles for the sake of compromise.
MADDOW: But a unified party line vote at this point accomplishes nothing. I mean, can the Democrats do anything alone? Right now --
SCHUMER: We can`t do anything alone, but if it`s really positive progressive type stuff -- it may not be -- and we pick up a few Republicans, it would have to be with the majority of Democrats in the House and Senate.
But the bottom line is our main job here is, as I said, hold his feet to the fire. It`s not going to be to sit in a room and say, where can we compromise, where we can`t? If he proposes things, that might -- he said he was for closing the carried interest loophole. I`m not going to vote against it if he proposes it. All the Republicans will, but I won`t. I think we should close the carried interest loophole.
There are a few examples here and I`m not going to rule them out, but most of the things we`ll be talking about whether it`s health care or education or transportation or helping the poor or voting rights or guns or choice or Planned Parenthood, we`re going to oppose them tooth and nail. There`s no way for compromise on any of those.
MADDOW: Let me ask you a hard-line edge on that which is the Supreme Court. The Republicans took this unprecedented step. They didn`t let President Obama make a Supreme Court appointment for almost a year now.
SCHUMER: Very moderate, mainstream nominee.
MADDOW: A nominee who a lot of progressives would have been very disappointed in, actually, although he`s very well respected.
SCHUMER: Yes.
MADDOW: But that was an incredibly radical thing the Republicans did. Senator Jeff Merkley of Oregon says they stole a Supreme Court seat.
SCHUMER: That`s a fair statement.
MADDOW: Didn`t they just get away with it?
SCHUMER: They did.
MADDOW: I mean, there are no consequences for it?
SCHUMER: Well, the consequences are going to be down the road. The consequences are going to be down the road.
We are not going to settle on a Supreme Court nominee if they don`t appoint someone who is really good, we`re going to oppose them tooth and nail. Now, then, they won`t have 60 votes to put in an out-of-the-mainstream nominee. Then they`ll have to make a choice, change the rules.
It`s going to be hard for them to change the rules because there are a handful of Republicans who believe in the institution of the Senate and they don`t change the rules.
MADDOW: Is there --
SCHUMER: But we are not going to make it easy for them to pick a Supreme Court justice.
MADDOW: Is there an argument to be made, though, if it is a fair statement that that was basically a stolen seat, so it isn`t theirs to fill, then in that case, no nominee would be legitimate because that seat should have been filled by President Obama.
SCHUMER: It`s hard for me to imagine a nominee that Donald Trump would choose that would get Republican support that we could support. So, you`re right.
MADDOW: And so, you will do your best to hold the seat open.
SCHUMER: Absolutely.
MADDOW: In terms of your transition from Harry Reid to you, for the Democratic leadership in the Senate, one of the things that Harry Reid sort of took on personally in a very ostentatious way is he took on a personal fight with the Koch brother, Charles and David Koch.
SCHUMER: Yes, yes.
MADDOW: Talked about them hundreds of times on the Senate floor.
SCHUMER: He did a great job.
MADDOW: He did a great job but the Koch brothers now today were treated to the news that the guy who used to run Freedom Partners for them, their political network, is apparently going to be director of legislative affairs in the White House.
SCHUMER: I didn`t know that.
MADDOW: Which -- it`s not official but that`s the reporting today.
SCHUMER: And they opposed Trump -- see, here`s what`s going on here. Trump ran against the Democratic and Republican establishments, against both. Trump as president-elect has been totally captured by the hard right. The Koch brothers were opposed to him in the campaign and that will make him a failure.
I said to this to him. You know, he`s called me occasionally on the phone. I said this to him. I said, if you just get embraced by the hard right, and I named Vice President Pence and a few of the others who are pushing him in that direction, you will be so far away from where the average American is, even the average Trump voter was, the non-bigoted parts of them who just want to change because they were so upset, you`ll be a failure. And I don`t think he gets that.
MADDOW: How did he react?
SCHUMER: He didn`t say anything.
But I don`t think he gets that. I think what I think might happen is, the hard right runs the show. Now, they`ll fail because the right wing ideologues, they are so out of touch with America, Trump just sits back and tweets things and I called him today in my little speech and I said, we can`t afford a Twitter presidency.
I said, for instance, you know, he can tweet about his little friend Putin, but if he doesn`t get the intelligence briefings, how`s he going to know the bad things Putin are doing? You can tweet about saving 800 jobs in Carrier, I`m glad he saved them. What about the 1,300 that are going to Mexico? Five hundred down the road at that Rexnord and the thousands every week that we lose?
You can`t tweet a policy. So, the combination of the hard right running the show -- even though Trump didn`t campaign as a hard-right guy, he campaigned as this populist sometimes with very bad and racist bigoted overtones then him just out there tweeting, it`s not going to work. And we have an opportunity. As the Chinese say, danger is opportunity.
So, I am -- I was distraught after the election, but I`m now actually invigorated by the challenge and our ability to succeed in this challenge.
MADDOW: Let me ask you. I don`t know if you have seen this. I don`t want to blind side you with this. This is the latest statement, latest tweet as you were just saying -- president-elect`s latest unsolicited pronouncement on the intelligence community. This was his tweet just a little while ago tonight. You can see the scare quotes there. ""The `intelligence` briefing on so called `Russian hacking` was delayed until Friday. Perhaps more time needed to build a case. Very strange.""
We`re actually told -- intelligence sources tell NBC News that since this tweet has been posted that actually, this intelligence briefing for the president-elect was always planned for Friday, it hasn`t been delayed. But he`s taking these shots, this antagonism -- he`s taunting the intelligence community.
SCHUMER: Let me tell you, you take on the intelligence community, they have six ways from Sunday at getting back at you. So, even for a practical, supposedly, hard-nosed businessman, he`s being really dumb to do this.
MADDOW: What do you think the intelligence community would do if they were --
SCHUMER: I don`t know. But from what I am told, they are very upset with how he has treated them and talked about them. And we need the intelligence community. We don`t know what`s going to -- look at the Russian hacking. Without the intelligence community, we wouldn`t have discovered it.
MADDOW: Do you think he has an agenda to dismantle parts of the intelligence community? This form of taunting hostile --
(CROSSTALK)
SCHUMER: Let me tell you -- whether you`re a super liberal Democrat or a very conservative Republican, you should be against dismantling the intelligence community.
MADDOW: Senator Charles Schumer of New York, as of today the Senate minority leader, leader of the Democrats in the Senate for the new Congress that begins today. Please stay in touch over this time.
SCHUMER: We will.
MADDOW: I will tell you that we have not always had the easiest time in the world talking to leadership of the Democratic Party in the Obama executive branch or in the Democratic Party legislative branch, and I hope this is a new era for that, too.
SCHUMER: Rachel, they can say a lot of bad things about me. Inaccessibility ain`t one of them.
MADDOW: I`ll hold you to it. Thank you, sir. Appreciate it.
SCHUMER: Nice to see you.
MADDOW: All right. Much more on deck tonight, including Senator Bernie Sanders also here live.
SCHUMER: Also from Madison Heights.
MADDOW: All right. We`ve got much more to come tonight. I said it was a big show and I meant it. Just had this fascinating conversation with the brand new as of today new Democratic leader of the Senate, Chuck Schumer, the most powerful Democrat in Washington now in the Trump era.
Now, next, we`re about to be joined by the most influential progressive in the country, and he really is a graduate of the same high school that Chuck Schumer went to in Brooklyn. James Madison High School, this is your life! At least this is your night on THE RACHEL MADDOW SHOW.
Senator Bernie Sanders joins us live, next. We`ll be right back.
MADDOW: Maybe the most unlikely member of the new Senate Democratic leadership team is someone who technically and sometimes is not a Senate Democrat.
Senator Bernie Sanders, capital ""I"" independent of Vermont. He`ll be the Democrats` new chair of outreach in the Democratic leadership team in the Senate. You can see him doing his thing today in New York in supporting the New York governor`s plan to make a college education way, way, way more accessible. Watch this.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (I), VERMONT: In a time when we have a president-elect who thinks it`s a great idea to give hundreds of billions of dollars in tax breaks to the top two-tenths of one percent, we have a better idea and that idea --
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
And that idea is to make public colleges and universities tuition-free for every person in New York state, in Vermont, and in America.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
If New York state does it this year, mark my words, state after state will follow.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
(END VIDEO CLIP)
MADDOW: Joining us now, I`m very pleased to say, is Senator Bernie Sanders, leader of outreach for the Senate Democrats, former candidate for president, of course, and now the leader of his own post-election nonprofit, which is called ""Our Revolution.""
Senator Sanders, it`s great to see you. Thank you for being here.
SANDERS: Good to be with you, Rachel.
MADDOW: Are you rested and recovered after your election journey?
SANDERS: Ready to go.
MADDOW: Ready to go. You look like it.
I know you heard a bit of my conversation with Senator Schumer here. You guys went to the same high school. You`ve known each other for a long time.
Let me ask you candidly, how sort of rested and ready do you feel like Democrats are for the Trump era? Are you confident in the plans, in the strategic planning, in the operations thus far?
SANDERS: No. I think Chuck is off to a good start. He has brought together some very, very good people. And he understands something, and that is that at the end of the day the way we`re going to bring about change, the way we`re going to stop Trump is not just inside the beltway. You need an outside-the-beltway strategy. And that`s in a sense what my job is as part of the Democratic leadership.
MADDOW: What does that mean?
SANDERS: What that means is on January 15th -- for the first time in the modern history of the Democratic Party -- Democrats are going to be organizing rallies all across this country in opposition to the Republican budget which calls for throwing 30 million people off of health care, throwing their insurance away, privatizing Medicare, making massive cuts in Medicaid and at the same time giving huge tax breaks to the wealthy.
So what I think Chuck understands and what Democrats increasingly understand, is you can`t just go to fund-raisers with wealthy people. You`ve got to get out in the real world. You`ve got to mobilize people. You`ve got to educate people. You`ve got to listen to people and that is the transformation they need which, by the way, is why I am strongly supporting Keith Ellison to be the new chair of the DNC.
MADDOW: He has -- you feel like he has that same organizing model?
SANDERS: Absolutely. Absolutely.
MADDOW: This day of sort of resistance, this January 15th plan, this will be the weekend before the inauguration. You`re not expecting people to convene in one place, not telling everybody to come to Washington. You`re telling people to rally in their home districts, in their home states.
SANDERS: Right. What we`re asking is U.S. senators, members of the House, labor unions, environmental groups, senior groups, ordinary people to come together and tell the Republican Party that their priorities are absolutely backwards, we will not accept -- you know, Rachel, if you simply throw 30 million people off of health insurance, this is what the Republicans intend to do by repealing the Affordable Care Act, they have no alternative. It`s not like we`re replacing it. They`re throwing 30 million people off of health insurance.
Their estimates are that thousands of people every single year will die, people will get much sicker than they should have been because they won`t be able to go to a doctor. This is vulgar. It is vicious. It is unacceptable. We have to fight back.
Description drug costs which are now outrageous will go up for senior citizens because when you repeal the Affordable Care Act, you`re going to be doing away with the provision that provides federal funding to subsidize drugs for seniors. So -- the so-called donut hole.
So, this is a disaster. This is a disaster and we have got to fight back and we have to tell Mr. Trump and his friends that they`re not going to get away with this.
And the other point that has to be made -- and I think it`s an important one -- is during the campaign, as you well know, Trump said over and over again, he said, ""I am the only Republican out there who will not cut Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid."" And right now, we have the Republican Party working overtime trying to cut Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid.
So, Trump has got to tell the American people one of two things -- either he lied blatantly and he has no intention of keeping his campaign promises, or else he has to tell Republicans right now he will veto any legislation that will cut Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid.
MADDOW: In addition to that role that you`ve got in Senate leadership and the kind of demonstrations you`re calling for there, it`s interesting calling for members of Congress themselves and senators themselves --
SANDERS: Yes, ain`t it?
MADDOW: Right, exactly, making that bridge. Bridges go both ways, I get it. In addition to that, though, you`ve got your own organization. You`ve got this post-election organization --
SANDERS: It`s not my organization. That`s illegal. I`m a United States senator and I can`t head it up.
An organization came out of the Sanders campaign for president. It`s called ""Our Revolution."" And what that organization has done -- I am not involved, it would be illegal for me to be involved in the day-to-day operations. What they have done is a pretty good job in trying to elect candidates from the school board up to the United States House of Representatives. And they`ve got a pretty good record and they`ve won some good victories.
And the goal of that organization is to get people involved in the political process at the grassroots level from city councils, school board, governor, whatever it may be. And get people to be thinking politically and to be active politically.
MADDOW: Do you feel support for this type of strategy that you`re describing? Obviously, the kind of strategy you`re talking about right now for resisting what the Republicans are doing for building the kind of future of the Democratic Party that you`re talking about here, a lot of that is an extrapolation of what you did in order to have such success in the primary.
Do you still feel like a man alone in the Democratic Party for preaching that way of approaching politics?
SANDERS: Well, less alone. Less alone. The fact that Senator Schumer is supportive of these ideas, he is the leader --
MADDOW: Put you in leadership.
SANDERS: That`s right, put me in leadership.
But I think the Democrats -- many of them, I will not tell you all, all right, some Democrats say, ""Hmm, we`re doing Obamacare, I`ve got a good position, I`m a member of the DNC, do I really want all these young people, working people, to come into my party? My party."" And some of them say no.
On the other hand, there are a lot who understand that when we have lost the House, when we lost the Senate, when we lost the White House, when we have lost 900 legislative seats, two-thirds of the governors` chairs are now controlled by Republicans, maybe, maybe something is fundamentally wrong with the Democratic Party.
And I think within the Democratic Party, more and more people understand we have to change the dynamics. We have to open the doors to young people, working people. We need to bring a lot more people into the process.
MADDOW: Senator Bernie Sanders, independent of Vermont now in the Democratic Senate leadership is our guest right now. We`ll be right back with Senator Sanders right after this.
MADDOW: Back with us now is Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont.
Senator Sanders, again, thank you for the time tonight.
Today was the first day of the new Congress. And on the other side of Capitol Hill from the Senate, things went a little wobbly. The House Republicans, who have a big majority, last night, behind closed doors, they voted so that the first thing they would do as a new Congress was gut the Congressional Ethics Office. Then, black box, we don`t know what happened, but the results, you know, the next day, this afternoon, was they had to take it all back.
And you see a lot of press headlines today crediting Trump tweeting against the timing of their changes and as being -- maybe that`s what caused it. The other thing is apparently the phones lit up like you couldn`t believe on Capitol Hill and social media went crazy.
SANDERS: If you think the phones are going to light up because of what they did the other day, you are going to see phones really light up when they try to cut Medicare and Medicaid and Social Security.
And here is most important point I think that people have got to understand. Republicans think they have a mandate, let us not forget that Trump lost the popular vote by almost 3 million votes. That on virtually every major issue facing the people of this country, whether it is cutting Social Security or expanding Social Security, whether it`s raising the minimum wage, whether it`s pay equity, rebuilding our infrastructure, the American people want to go forward in a progressive way. They want -- Republicans want -- the wealthiest people to start paying their fair share of taxes.
The truth is and I say this not in a particularly partisan way, the Republican ideology is way out of touch with where ordinary Americans are. Our job is to bring the American people in to the process and say, do you want to give huge tax breaks to billionaires and cut Social Security and Medicare? The American people do not want that to happen and our job is to mobilize them through social media, through rallies, out on the streets.
MADDOW: That said, the Congress that they elected, by hook or crook, the Congress that they elected has that as their objective.
SANDERS: That`s right.
MADDOW: I mean, the tax cuts for the wealthy, the dismantling Medicare -- Obamacare. They have already filed legislation to do that. They prepared legislation to build the freaking wall on the southern border.
I mean, the Congress that`s there that they just elected is not going to pursue the kind of priorities that you say are the American people`s priorities.
SANDERS: It`s not what I say, Rachel. I mean, it`s what every poll out there tells us. I mean, you go out -- you say to the American people, should we raise the minimum wage? Yes, we should. Should we have pay equity for women? Oh, absolutely, we should.
Should we ask the wealthy to start paying their fair share of taxes? Yes. Should we do comprehensive immigration reform? Yes. Should we do criminal justice?
These are not my ideas. This is what the American people want. And the failure of the progressive movement, and let`s be honest about it, is we have not mobilized people around that agenda. And Republicans have been able to develop wedge issues and win elections, with the help of the Koch brothers and their billionaire friends.
MADDOW: But you think basically from this opposition position, there is an opportunity to mobilize people around these issues?
SANDERS: Absolutely.
MADDOW: Anybody who has been interested in politics for a while has seen, you know, votes go ways they didn`t want, seen decisions that they didn`t want, made through democracy. It does feel like there is something different in the reaction to this election result. It`s beyond disappointed and angry.
And I`m asking you this because you I think embody the hopes for so many progressive Americans and so many people who are otherwise alienated from politics. People are afraid now of what`s going to happen in the country because Trump is president. What -- fear is a weak place from which to operate. Fear is not a position of strength.
What do you say when people come to you and they tell you that you`re afraid?
SANDERS: I think there are legitimate reasons to be afraid. This guy will have his finger on the nuclear button. I think what is important, though, is to remember there have been very, very difficult times in American history. And we`ve got a rocky history.
And I ask people who say, ""Oh, things are so awful today,"" well, 60, 70 years ago, black kids in the South were going to segregated schools, could not drink in a white water fountain. People fought back.
A woman lost her run for president this year. A hundred years ago today, women didn`t even have the right to vote. Couldn`t go to the schools they wanted.
You are sitting here, right? You are a leading correspondent. That wasn`t the case 50 years ago.
Gay rights, think about the revolution that has taken place over the last 20 years. The trade union movement, the struggle that workers had to face.
So, I get impatient, Rachel, when people say, ""Oh, you know, I`m giving up, you know, I`m in despair."" You know, forget about that. You`ve got to fight back as people have throughout the history of this country. People have stood up and fought back.
And the most important point, as I said a moment ago, on all of these issues, the majority of the people are with us and we have to go out and reach out to people. Bring them in to the political process and fight for the kind of nation that we know we can become.
If there`s anything that I learned, running for president, is there are -- and this is not rhetoric. This is truth. There are so many decent, good, wonderful people out there who want to create a nondiscriminatory society, want to create a society of environmental justice, of social justice and economic justice. I believe that`s the majority spirit in this country. And our job is to mobilize those people.
MADDOW: Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, nice to see you, sir. Come back soon. Thank you.
SANDERS: You got it.
MADDOW: We`ll be right back.
MADDOW: There are still a couple of big jobs that haven`t been filled in the incoming administration, head of the Veterans Affairs, Agriculture, for example. But at about 10:00 last night, we started to get word that the president-elect had settled on a pick for trade representative. His name is Robert Lighthizer. He had the job before under Ronald Reagan. That was the reporting last night, Lighthizer.
And today, we got the official announcement from the Trump transition that they had indeed picked him for this post. This was their announcement, ""President-elect Trump to nominate Robert Lighter as U.S. trade representative.""
You put them side by side, you will see that there is something wrong here. These are not two contrary announcements. These are not two different guys being announced for the same job.
What you see here is the Trump transition team attempting to announce Robert Lighthizer has been picked as U.S. trade representative but they can`t spell it. So, they just call him Robert Lighter. It`s easier. It`s easier.
People know what we mean, right? It`s like.
It`s been wonderful to have both Senator Schumer here tonight, the new leader of the Democrats in the Senate, and to have Senator Bernie Sanders here. Hoping to make a sort of standing date with Senator Sanders in the months ahead.
That does it for us tonight. We`ll see you again tomorrow.
Now, it`s time for ""THE LAST WORD WITH LAWRENCE O`DONNELL"".
Good evening, Lawrence.

MELBER: And the Trump biographer kicked off Donald Trump`s golf course by the President-elect -- joins me live tonight. ALL IN starts now.
(END VIDEOTAPE)
MELBER: Good evening from New York. I`m Ari Melber in for Chris Hayes. Our top story tonight involves some good news in Washington or at least the defeat of potential bad news.
There are still 17 days until Donald Trump becomes president but November`s election kicked off today on Capitol Hill and the consequences with the 115th Congress, they have the ceremony swearing in members, pictures with family, it`s supposed to be a time of symbolism and pageantry, a layup for the new party to welcome everyone into town before any big fights or hard decisions have to really begin. But it got difficult right away for republican leaders. That`s because House Republicans held a conference vote last night to dilute ethics investigations into members of congress. Their plan was to quickly pass that diluted rule today. But they weren`t quick enough.
Here`s some of the highlights of what happened, which may offer a roadmap of opposition for the Trump era. House Republicans held their closed-door meeting last night, stripping the ethics office of its independence. The plan was watering down the investigative powers set up in 2006 after several ethics scandals landed three members of congress in jail. The new rule would end anonymous tips which are obviously a key protection when congress is basically investigating itself and people worry about payback and it would also end public reports which were supposed to offer some transparency even when no greater punishment against a member was ordered.
Last night`s vote was taken without advanced warning, it was over the objections of some republican leaders and while it was a federal holiday and many people may have taken a break from the news yesterday, if so, I congratulate you, the New York Times was not on a break. Investigative reporter Eric Lipton filed a big story on this quote, ""With no warning, House Republicans vote to gut independent ethics office."" Word spread quickly outrage pouring in from all sides. Now this morning, Paul Ryan was still trying to justify that planned vote against criticism. He cited his member`s belief that ""The Office of Congressional Ethics is in need of reform to protect due process.""
Meanwhile, Trump aide, Kellyanne Conway, was on four different morning shows today and she said republicans did have a mandate for exactly this kind of change.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
KELLYANNE CONWAY, TRUMP ADVISOR: The republicans have been given the majority in the house and the senate, all the governor -- most of the governorships, they`ve won over 1,000 state legislative seats under President Obama`s watch. So, there`s a mandate there for them to make significant change.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
MELBER: So this morning, a casual observer might think this looked like any other story in this new era. Sure the New York Times can expose a problematic approach to ethics, people can complain, sure, but republicans have the votes, right? They could do what they want. Or can they? Anti- corruption groups criticized this move vehemently from the left, right, and center, including conservative group judicial watch and according to some observers, angry phone calls were pouring in this morning to congressional offices.
Now we checked on this and there is data that matches this. Take a look at the Google search trends today. The number of searches for who is my congressman, a first spike last night after the New York Times story broke and a second this morning right around the time people might be watching the news on TV or reading it online. And that was around the time someone else was reading news.
President-elect Donald Trump weighing in, tweeting, quote, ""With all the congress has to work on, do they really have to make the weakening of the Independent Ethics Watchdog, as unfair as it may be, their number one act in priority. Focus on tax reform, healthcare and so many other things of far greater importance. #DTS"", which is, is his really cool way of saying ""drain the swamp"". Now, Trump brought attention to this dispute which certainly made the republicans` lives harder.
We`ll also note, though he was supporting their argument for narrowing the office`s powers, because he was saying it was still unfair, that`s why they wanted to change it. So, he`s not objecting to the substance of curbing the ethics board, they`re just to the timing or you might say even the branding. But anyway, House Republicans ultimately backed down from this plan to hamstring the Office of Congressional Ethics. That`s a win for people who want independent ethics oversight for this congress, which may not be everyone, but I feel like it`s probably close to everyone in the country who`s not a member of congress.
And politically, some republicans are now mad that they did choose to make this their opening argument. Take a look, one republican house member saying anonymously, ""A circular firing squad -- our first day here and we`re passing around the handgun.""
Put aside the politics though, and this lightning fast story shows that investigative reporting does still matter. Then not every issue boils down to if the republicans have the vote, some issues may boil down to whether some of these votes are too embarrassing or too brazen to even be taken in public.
Joining me now, New York Times Investigative Reporter, Eric Lipton, who broke the story on that vote as it shaped up last night. Good evening to you. I will ask you and start a process question. When you filed that last night, would you have said you`d expected it to be reversed by tonight?
ERIC LIPTON, NEW YORK TIMES INVESTIGATIVE REPORTER: Not at all. I did not expect it there to be that kind of a turnaround and the extent of outrage was surprising and pretty extraordinary, the mobilization of phone calls and I do have to say that, I mean, I reported this before it was probably announced but there were quite a number of other reporters that were working on it and publishing on it yesterday as well, so I don`t want to -- there were - there were quite a number of reporters who worked on the federal holiday to, you know, make sure that the public knew about this.
MELBER: Hey, man, I work on television where there`s one person in front of the camera and then hundreds more, all working throughout the building, so, I know what you mean, appreciate your nod, the fact that, yes, many investigative reports are on this. Having said that, it does look like the New York Times` piece did sparked incredible reaction. What do you make of what that tells us about where the lines are in this era? Obviously, last night, republican leaders thought they could get away with this.
LIPTON: I think that there`s a lot of sensitivity in the public right now. There`s an energized, you know, concern about what`s going on in Washington and potential conflicts of interest be it with the White House or with congress. Among, you know, even among democrats and you saw mobilization by the left, the right, you know, and groups of all kinds, more than a dozen of them wrote in, they complaining to the house speaker and the minority leader. And there are thousands of phone calls, phone lines were flooded and house members offices with people calling to complain, and I think that it really -- they were, like, why would we take up this issue that`s going to distract the public and distract us when, you know, there`s so many other important issues and they caved.
MELBER: Is there an irony, if we want to call it that, the that the ""drain the swamp"" language has now done one finite real thing, right, to keep up some ethics oversight in the house, while the originator of that language, Donald Trump appears to continue completely unabated with a host of conflicts?
LIPTON: It certainly, you know, put the House Republicans in the spot and it was easy for Trump to say because the Office of Congressional Ethics has no jurisdiction at all over the White House, so he could do anything he wants to prop up an agency that can`t investigate him and it costs him nothing and it only put the republican house members in an embarrassing spot. So, it was -- it was a quite a maneuver for him to sort of, you know, push this in their faces and I`m a little surprised that he chose to do this as one of his opening acts to, with the republicans that he needs to work with in congress.
MELBER: Eric Lipton, one of the many investigative reporters on the case, thanks for your time tonight.
LIPTON: Thank you.
MELBER: I`m joined now by Katrina vanden Heuvel, Editor and Publisher of The Nation Magazine and MSNBC Contributor, Sam Seder, Host of the Majority Report. Picking up on that Katrina, what do you take from this incident?
KATRINA VANDEN HEUVEL, THE NATION EDITOR AND PUBLISHER: Well, I take that quality investigative reporting still matters. It can, in this politicized moment, lead to a transpartisan campaign of mobilization which shamed this moronic -- mind-bendingly moronic republican caucus from taking action that we`ve got transparency in ethics. I also take that I don`t think the media should reflexively credit Donald Trump and his tweets with creating action. It took thousands of people, thousands of calls and organizing and resistance to move forward on this. And I think, you know, as Eric said, Donald Trump continues to sell the presidency, not his business as he should, and I think we need to keep a laser like focus on his own conflicts of interest, which he doesn`t seem to feel any shame about.
MELBER: Well, to your point, I don`t want to be unfair to the legislative knowledge in a Donald Trump tweet, but he seemed to not even understand that the reason this was coming up now is because the parliamentary procedure sets the rules once the beginning of the two-year term.
SAM SEDER, THE MAJORITY REPORT HOST AND MSNBC CONTRIBUTOR: Right. Right. The conference has to vote on it, it gets into this sort of omnibus setting of the rules. I mean, look, you know, I think Paul Ryan and Kevin McCarthy knew this was a bad idea. And they didn`t want it.
MELBER: Because they were against it to begin with.
SEDER: They were against it in the beginning, because this is -- this is really -- this is sort of bunting and catching. I mean, this is basic stuff. You don`t start your new congress by saying ""We`re going to get rid of the ethics or its essentials.""
MELBER: Sounds bad.
SEDER: I don`t, you know, look, I would like to think that this is an indication and a roadmap for the future, but this is -- this is a process issue that, literally, I think this type of overreach is almost impossible to imagine again, except for some very major issues. So, you know, it`s good that they didn`t get away with this. I think Donald Trump is getting too much credit for actually understanding what was going on in some ways. Maybe he wants to be the only -- wants to have the monopoly on all the lack of ethics in Washington, but the real game is starting after this and that is when they start to pass legislation that has a political salience and does not resonate with the -- even the right wing in the way this did.
HEUVEL: Well, I take some issue with what Sam said because I think there is a template here. I think that you`re going to find the importance of democrats at the national level driving this message of overreach, of gutting ethics, of billionaires, generals, and ideologues, not draining the swamp, feeding it, filling it with bottom feeders. Take that out to the country and I think you could have an ongoing mobilization. It may not defeat legislation but it will hasten the view that this GOP congress at a time when millions voted for jobs for, you know, healthcare, not a sham populism, a shameless plutocracy, but really addressing the condition of their lives. I think if you can drive that message forward, you`ll get some real traction.
SEDER: Yeah, I think that`s true, but I think, I think one of the lessons from the election was that you really need to engage in politics, and saying that Donald Trump lacks ethics, I mean, I think it`s possible that the reaction to this in congress was because Donald Trump has gotten away with so many conflicts of interest and so many seemingly brazen ignoring of ethics that they took it out on congress where they could actually get some impact. But down the road it has to be about politics. It has to be about the politics of health care -
(CROSSTALK)
HEUVEL: And jobs.
SEDER: -- politics, about jobs, about social security, about the EPA, about the FDA, about the gutting of regulations, I mean, the democrats have to start talking about politics and policy. It`s going to be fine to talk about Donald Trump as all of his ethical lapses, but the bottom line is they`re going to have to start selling --
(CROSSTALK)
MELBER: Katrina, isn`t part of the connective tissue there though that a criticism of a rigged system as Donald Trump put it, or one where bankers make all decision as Bernie put it, is the politics?
HEUVEL: Yes. Is the politics and I think you can drive that out into the country coming off of the first day. Just think of what the first day of the house, the republican -- what -- their first order of business was to self-enrich themselves, in a way, so I do think Sam is right. This is -- we -- the democrats can`t just do ""Trump is unfit"". We saw where that led in the election. I think you need to connect the rigged system and the fact that you have a lot of billionaires about to come forward without their disclosing of their financial reports and Donald Trump is conflict of interest walking. So, I think you need to do the politics but connect it to the issues as they try to roll back the civilizing reforms of our time.
WELBER: And if it -- if it walks like a duck and then quacks like a duck, it`s a conflict of interest. We`re out of time, Katrina Vanden Heuvel, Sam Seder, thank you both very much.
Still to come, the biographer who says the President-elect had him kicked off a Trump golf course. I`ll talk with him about what happened and why David Koch was there.
Plus, why Donald Trump is bashing one carmaker, and celebrating another. The truth, the numbers behind Trump trying to take credit for bringing jobs to the U.S. after a two-minute break. Stay with us.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
TED CRUZ, UNITED STATES SENATOR: I don`t believe that Washington should be picking winners and losers.
HERMAN CAIN, FORMER REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: The government should not be in the business of picking winners and losers because most of the time they pick the losers.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It`s time to end the government`s ability to pick winners and losers.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It is not government`s role to pick the winners and losers.
TOM PRICE, U.S. REPRESENTATIVE FOR GEORGIA: It`s time to end having Washington pick winners and losers in the marketplace.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We shouldn`t be picking winners and losers in Washington. We should be setting the conditions for economic growth so that the private sector can create jobs. Washington`s not good at picking winners and losers so we shouldn`t try.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WELBER: Republicans have long said they are big believers in the free market economy where Washington doesn`t pick, quote, ""winners and losers"". But boy, things are changing.
This morning, President-elect Donald Trump threatening General Motors, tweeting, ""General Motors is sending Mexican-made model of Chevy Cruze to U.S. car dealers tax free across border. Make in USA or pay big border tax."" Four hours later, Trump celebrated one of GM`s competitors, along with himself, triumphantly tweeting out an article ""Ford to scrap Mexico plant, invest in Michigan due to Trump policies."" As it turns out, we can tell you tonight, neither of those claims hold up well to scrutiny.
The Chevy claim about half true. Chevy does, in fact, send a small number of Cruze hatchbacks, which is built in Mexico to dealers in the U.S., but it is less than 5,000 vehicles -- that`s out of 190,000 sold. As GM noted after Trump`s attack, quote, ""All Chevrolet Cruze sedan sold in the U.S. are built in GM`s assembly plant in Lordstown Ohio."" Kind of a, important thing there, that fact.
And the Ford claim looks even more problematic. Ford did announce today that it`s canceling a $1.6 billion plant in Mexico in order to invest 700 million in its Michigan operation. A deal the automaker said would add 700 jobs, which is great. But in remarks to reporters, Ford CEO Mark Fields was suggesting the decision did have sort of something to do with Trump.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
MARK FIELDS, FORD CEO: We`re also encouraged by the pro-growth policies that President-elect Trump and the new congress have indicated that they will pursue.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
MELBER: That`s a fine forward-looking statement. Fields, of course, has plenty of reason to want to get in on the President-elect`s good side. But there is more to this story. Surprise, in an interview with CNBC, he conceded it was a decline in demand for those small cars that were set to be built at the Mexico plant, not Donald Trump, which drove this decision about the Mexico plant.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
FIELDS: Over the last couple of years, we`ve seen small cars marketly decline. So, every year, we`re looking our capacity, we`re looking our forecast for demand, and it became very clear that we didn`t need this plant.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
MELBER: That fact, publicly stated, didn`t stop Trump who hammered Ford during the election - the campaign, of course, for plans to expand in Mexico, now he`s claiming credit. Trump today tweeting out a story declaring ""Trump already delivering the jobs he promised America."" The story including a claim that Trump quote, ""brokered the deal"" for Sprint to add 5,000 jobs in America, even though funding for those jobs was long announced back in October, literally, before Trump was elected as part of a plan to fund 50,000 jobs.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Mr. President-elect, Sprint tells us that the 5,000 jobs that you announced today were part of the 50,000 --
(CROSSTALK)
DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT ELECT OF THE UNITED STATES: No, Sprint will give you -- Sprint will give you, I just spoke with the head person. He said because of me they`re going 5,000 jobs in the country.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
MELBER: So, the veracity of Trump`s claims about job creation, that`s one issue. The other issue is the entire impact of this whole thing. While, of course, saving any job in America is a celebration worthy event. Trump`s efforts, so far, amount to a very tiny drop in the bucket. Take a look at this chart. The auto bailout alone, under President Obama, saved an estimated one and a half million jobs. By comparison, if you add up all the jobs that Trump has even claimed credit for, the total is just 7,300. And that`s for the actual verified jobs, what we just broke down, the gap in between, well, Trump has help save arguably about 800 all from the actual carrier deal with the Indiana State Government.
Joining me now to unpack further is economist Dean Baker, Co-Director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research. So, on the one hand, you have the false exaggerated claims of his role. On the other hand, even if his role were saving these jobs, they are a tiny, tiny drop in the bucket by any national standard.
DEAN BAKER, CENTER FOR ECONOMIC AND POLICY RESEARCH CO-DIRECTOR: That`s right, I mean, I joke about this, we`re getting carrier shows, what we really need is policy. And you know, again, you have the chart there, just to put in further context. We have over 12 million manufacturing jobs in the country, so, what Donald Trump`s talking about is somewhere on the order of 0.01 of 1 percent of those jobs. And what we care about is the policy. You know, over the last six month, the dollar has risen about 10 percent against the euro, the British pound, the Japanese yen, other major currencies. That`s going to swamp the impact of, you know, these individualized deals. So, this is, you know, I joke about it-
(CROSSTALK)
MELBER: I wonder if you`re speaking in different language, though. When you just said, we care about the policy, right, someone listening at home could think ""No, don`t we care about the jobs?"" I mean, isn`t the point, we can put up on the screen the number of jobs under President Obama, yes through these federal policies, but you look at that private sector job creation, 15.6 million jobs, right? I mean, isn`t the message here that policy leads to jobs and what Donald Trump`s doing is not good for jobs because he`s just taking phone calls and there`s no replicable scalable plan?
BAKER: But, well, exactly. That`s what I`m saying. Obviously, we care about the jobs and we care -- that what will matter are the policies that produce jobs, and, you know, President Obama in that score, you know, not as successful as some of us might have liked. But yeah, that was a pretty good record, and, you know, when you stack up the millions of jobs, you know, that you`ve seen in the Obama administration, compared to with what you`re getting, you know, again, we don`t know, I mean Donald Trump`s indicated, this is a guy who will take credit for the sun coming up tomorrow. I mean, we don`t know what actually went on. Obviously, these businesses have great incentive to say that, ""Oh, yeah, of course, we`re doing this because of Donald Trump."", but we don`t really know. And I`m actually pointing out -- go a step further, because this goes beyond just picking winners as we ordinarily talk about. So, what the republicans were yelling about with President Obama was that he wants to promote solar energy. He wants to promote clean energy, he`s picking winners -- that was picking industries. Donald Trump is picking companies. That is much more pernicious. This is, you know, when you associate with authoritarian regimes and I`m being polite here. We don`t want to see a president that rewards individual companies for being nice to him. That`s a very, very scary thought.
MELBER: Well, I wonder about that. Because you know, congress cannot legislate for a single company or person. That`s called ""the bill of attainder"" -- it`s illegal. What you`re referring to is the fact that -- maybe the first time in history we have a President who seems to want to wield his power against individual companies. If he picks on smaller companies, he could risk their business for the year, right? He could technically bankrupt smaller companies if he picks on them.
BAKER: Absolutely. And, you know, this is not the way we want to see the United States. This is not the way we`ve conducted business. It`s not the way you want to see us conducting business. One more thing about picking winners that`s kind of ironic in this story, because the jobs at the plant in Michigan, that Ford was referring to, those are jobs in factories that are going to be producing hybrid and electric cars. Guess what? Those were the winners picked by President Obama. Those jobs would not be there were it not for President Obama`s policy of picking winners that apparently Trump thinks is good now.
MELBER: Right. You almost get the impression of the last President was sort of working on all of those policies and bills, maybe spending less time on the phone with the CEO`s. Dean Baker, thanks for your time tonight.
BAKER: Thanks for having me on.
MELBER: Democrats laying out their plans to now deal with the President Trump, coming up, as we`ll show you what the new leader in the senate had to say in his very first floor speech today, including what he calls a dangerous Twitter presidency.
MELBER: By gaveling in a new congress today, republicans are beginning the countdown on January 20th to Washington`s first one-party government in six years. I think there`s probably no single policy, where one party government matters more than Obamacare for the simple reason that republicans have long enjoyed the political benefits of deriding the healthcare law, without ever having to worry about actually doing anything about it. They had found a veto-proof grievance, if you will, until now. Today, republicans must actually offer a plan for what happens if they actually end Obamacare. They`ve begun with a resolution to halt the financing through a bare majority and then there are various proposals to delay the actual repeal until they can figure out some kind of replacement. Trump counselor Kellyanne Conway says there`s no plan ready and she suggested the administration wants its health secretary confirmed first.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
CONWAY: Some experts say that it could take years to actually complete the process.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And right now, do you or do you not have a replacement plan ready to go, ramped up, ready to go, say, tomorrow?
CONWAY: We have pieces of it that we need to discuss.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What is it?
CONWAY: Well, we don`t have an HHS secretary confirmed yet.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
MELBER: If republicans actually gut Obamacare and throw millions off the plans, it could be the largest self-inflicted political wound in a generation, to say nothing of the humanitarian cost. Which is why the conservative Wall Street Journal editorial board is even warning fellow conservatives, the move could lead many to blame republicans quote ""for any turmoil in insurance market"" and adding quote ""Republicans will own health care, like it or not."" Alternatively, though, if republicans vote to repeal Obamacare, while basically leaving it all in place until the next election or even the next administration, nobody even knows what to call that kind of stunt. Should democrats then rejoice that millions would keep their health care even as millions of people claim that reality is changing? An exercise in what we might call the ""politics of Obamacare truthiness"" or maybe just ""Trumpiness""? President Obama is going to Capitol Hill tomorrow to meet with House Democrats about this very dilemma and crafting a strategy for a post-Obama administration era. Now, one person essential to this debate is Jamie Harris. He was a legislative strategist for the house democratic leadership and he`s a man who also happens to be running for DNC chair right now. He`s our guest to talk about this. Next.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER, (D) NEW YORK: Many Americans are afraid, Mr. President-elect, that instead of rolling up your sleeves and forging serious policies, for you Twitter suffices. But these issues are complex and demand both careful consideration and action.
We cannot tweet them away. So, Mr. president-elect, if there`s one part of my speech that I hope you listen to and take to heart, it`s this one -- and I mean it with the best intentions -- if you abandon change and simply embrace the shop-worn hard right pro-corporate pro-elite policies diametrically opposed to the many campaign themes that helpedyou win working class votes and get you elected, your presidency will not succeed.
We Democrats will hold you accountable.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
MELBER: Incoming Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer there gearing up to lead a united Democratic opposition fighting against large parts of congressional Republicans` agenda, which includes, of course, swift repeal of Obamacare.
Joining me now, as promised, to discuss what it all looks like is Jamie Harrison, chair of the South Carolina Democratic Party, a candidate for DNC chair, and as I mentioned, someone who has worked on Capitol Hill and intimately knows parliamentary procedure when you were with Clyburn.
JAMIE HARRISON, CHAIR, SOUTH CAROLINA DEMOCRATIC PARTY: So, let`s start there. What are Democrats going to two in this meeting tomorrow with the president as they try to prep for the Obamacare onslaught in a time when they`re in the minority?
Listen, Ari, it`s good to see you. You know, the Republicans are going to use a budget reconciliation process here in order to try to dismantle the Affordable Care Act. It`s the only way that they can get past the filibuster rule in the Senate in order to get something to President Trump.
But even using that process, it`s going to be a sticky process to do that, because then they can only target pieces of the Affordable Care Act that can have to do with spending or taxes. And so they will have to send that legislative to the parliamentarian of the Senate and then go through a long and -- elongated process there as well.
So in the House of Representatives really what they have to do is they have to be the voice of resistance. They have to utilize all of the things in their power, including the motion to recommit, which is a tool that the minority party can use for any legislation that comes on the House floor. It`s going to be a hard fight, but this isn`t Star Trek where folks say ""resistance is futile."" Resistance is going to be necessary for Democrats in order to protect the health care that 20 million Americans now enjoy.
MELBER: Well, when you talk about motion to recommit, you have all of our C-SPAN fans out there, their hearts fluttering, but there will be a lot of that parliamentary shell game.
The other piece of this is if you do win your race for DNC chair, you know, when you`re with the White House, your client would be the president on down running the party. Here, your first client beyond the Democrats around the country will be Chuck Schumer. What did you think of what he said today? How would you want to work with him on this? He clearly thinks there is a benefit to casting Donald Trump as abandoning working class supporters.
He put it in the the future tense. Some folks are pointing to the Goldman cabinet, the richest net worth cabinet in American history and saying it`s already happening.
HARRISON: Listen, if I`m in the DNC, I will work with Chuck Schumer. I will work with Nancy Pelosi, but what we`re going to do is -- the focus on D.C. is good. But focus -- real focus of this party has to be on the grass-roots level. We saw today -- it wasn`t because of what Chuck Schumer said or what Nancy Pelosi said in terms of the Republicans trying to repeal a or go back on ethics, it was the grass-roots that mobilized, thousands of people calling on Capitol Hill.
MELBER: That`s important. So Jamie you`re saying you believe it was all about the people out there. If anything, Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi weren`t holding big meetings on this, they weren`t make that big a deal out of it, you`re saying itwas more the people than D.C. Democrats?
HARRISON: That`s exactly right, Ari. And it shows us what can happen when the people mobilize.
I think if you look at the pipeline situation, the Dakota pipeline situation, it was about the grass-roots mobilizing and causing that to end, and we -- that`s what we need to focus on as a party. We have to build our grassroots. We have to activate them so that they can be that resistance.
I want to change -- Speaker Ryan said today that it`s been his dream to unify -- to have a unified government. We are going to turn that dream into a nightmare, and it`s doing that through resistance.
MELBER: Through resistance. It`s interesting you mentioned that. I mean, programming notes, Chuck Schumer will be on with Rachel next hour, which will be interesting. Later in our hour, we`re going to be looking at some other direct action, the sit-ins at Jeff Sessions office. There were arrests within the last hour.
Jamie Harrison, thank you for your time.
On that story, we`re going to bring you, the breaking news from Alabama, there was a day of protests and a sit-in, now these arrests. You`re looking at brand-new footage here. This is inside the government office of Alabama Senator Jeff Sessions who is Donald Trump`s nominee for attorney general. A lot of expectations about this fight, what you`re looking at, these new pictures, these arrests part of the resistance and the opposition to his nomination.
We`re going to show you that story with this breaking news after the break.
MELBER: Thing One tonight, when President Obama and his family vacate the White House, they reportedly are heading for a rental in northwest D.C. until Sasha completes high school. When the Obama`s plans first became public last May, Eric Owens wrote for the conservative website Daily Caller that that house was, quote, a ten-minute drive from Sasha Obama`s school, which seems relevant to the story.
But here`s how The Daily Caller actually headlined that story, quote, ""Obama`s fancy new mansion is located a thousand feet from the Islamic Center of Washington, D.C."" They even wrote that it was 1,906 feet from the Islamic Center, one of the largest mosques in the western hemisphere adding the embassy of Oman and the former embassy of Iran are very close to Obama`s new mansion.
Here`s a hot tip for The Daily Caller, there are a lot of embassies nearby when you move into embassy row, that`s an area known as a fancy part of Washington and whose residents have included Hillary Clinton, Donald Rumsfeld and the late Ted Kennedy.
But you`ll never guess who bought a house in that very same neighborhood? And that is thing two back in 60 seconds.
MELBER: Tonight, NBC News confirms Donald Trump`s daughter Ivanka and her husband Jared Kushner are moving into a house in Northwest D.C. As I was just mentioning, this is in the wealthy Kalorama neighborhood where numerous embassies are and it`s blocks away from where the Obamas are reportedly moving, so they will be neighbors.
It is also, we`ve been told, a three-minute walk from -- The Daily Caller as a report -- a report by Thomas Phippen (ph), I was mentioning this earlier, now he notes the house is, quote, near several embassies and the expansive Rock Creek Park area. And buried in the middle of this story, he adds, quote, ""incidentally, Ivanka`s new home will be about the same distance or slightly closer to the Islamic Center of Washington, D.C. than Obama`s house.""
This is what we were talking about earlier, notably that nugget about the Islamic Center, not in the headline or the priority for The Daily Caller now that this story involves the Trumps as it was for the story on Obama`s house, an irrelevant detail dominating The Daily Caller`s report there with writer Eric Owens naming the Islamic Center in that Obama housing story eight times.
And before he added the former embassy of Iran is in the neighborhood, too, another irrelevant detail The Daily Caller just happened to leave out oftheir Ivanka Trump housing report.
Meanwhile, what`s another residence less than a mile down the road from the Islamic Center of D.C.? Well, the Naval Observatory, the future home of Vice President- elect Mike Pence.
MELBER: And now to some breaking news that I mentioned earlier in our broadcast of Donald Trump`s cabinet appointments to date, only one has been rejected by the Senate before, attorney general nominee Jeff Sessions passed over for a federal judgeship in 1986.
Now today, activists led by the NAACP have been taking what they call a direct action urging Sessions to withdraw his name from consideration for the post.
Now, throughout the day, members of the NAACP held a sit-in at Alabama Senator Jeff Sessions` Mobile office, this is his government office, the footage you`re looking at is of that sit-in today. The country`s oldest civil rights group saying they want to continue to protest Sessions until he removes himself as the nominee or, they were saying, up until this evening until they got arrested.
Well, within the last hour, police officers arrived at the -- excuse me, police officers arrived and the NAACP members, including President Cornell Brooks, were arrested for continuing their sit-in there.
A Sessions confirmation hearing begin just one week from today. A key question facing the senator is whether he would put his political views aside and basically be able to enforce the law equally for all Americans if he was confirmed as attorney general. Those arrests here within the last hour and we`ll keep you posted on developments in this story.
Now coming up, kicked out by the president-elect, I`m going to talk with the Trump biographer who says Trump had him removed from his golf course this weekend. He`ll tell us exactly what happened and why David Koch was there. That`s next.
MELBER: All right. Our next story is about something very small, which could also be very big. It is about Donald Trump`s petty payback, but also about the prospects for free speech in a Trump era. On Friday, Harry Hurt, a writer went golfing with billionaire industrialist David Koch and a few friends at the Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach. And Hurt ran into Donald Trump himself.
Hurt says Trump kicked him off of the property because of a grudge over Hurt`s 1993 biography of Trump ""Lost Tycoon: the Many Lives of Donald J. Trump.""
Hurt says several security guards escorted him off the property after he spoke directly to Trump. Now, it is legal for a private citizen to remove someone from private property, but it is not legal to eject someone to eject someone from government property for their views, and it`s not usually legal for government law enforcement to target or escort anyone based on their views.
That is called viewpoint discrimination and the Supreme Court has held the government may not pick and choose the speakers that it likes, so if Donald Trump took this same golf approach on government property or with his government security detail, it would be a real problem.
And even if you view this incident as just some kind of petty sideshow from over the weekend, the fact is that in 17 days from now, if Trump did this on government property, or with government security, it would be illegal. The Secret service`s mission is to protect the president`s safety, not patrol protesters or biographers or whatever.
But keep this incident in mind as you look at the reports here from Politico that unlike past presidents, Trump is planning to continue employing some of his private security detail while president. A Trump spokesperson described that report as complete nonsense and blowing it all out of proportion.
Now, many Trump voters saw his lack of government experience as an asset, but since he has never served before, we don`t know whether he even realizes that while the president has many extra power, the president also has strong limitations. The First Amendment does not apply to the openers of the Trump International Golf Club, the First Amendment is a limit on the government. And starting January 20, that means the First Amendment will apply to a lot of things Donald Trump does. Is he ready?
Joining me now is Harry Hurt, author of ""The Lost Tycoon: the Many Lives of Donald J. Trump."" Tell us what exactly happened. You went up to Donald Trump on that golf course on Friday and then what happened?
HARRY HURT, TRUMP BIOGRAPHER: Well, I went up to him out of courtesy and respect for the office of the president of the United States. I had played there several times before and recently in 2015, the day before Easter, the Saturday before Easter had actually seen Donald Trump there with my golfing buddy David Koch,
Anyway, I went up to him and I simply said ""congratulations, sir."" I tipped mid-hat, I extended my hand. We shook hands. And then he went into an expletive-filled diatribe about the content of my book. He then said that he thought it was inappropriate for me to be playing at the golf course and he asked me to leave and I said that I would.
MELBER: So you said you would, then you go away and then what did security say to you when they approached you?
HURT: Well it was actually kind of comical because a security fellow who was very polite, he identified himself as Orlando, as in the city in Florida, told me that he was head of security and he asked me if i was Mr. Koch. And I said, no, Mr. Koch is standing over there, I`m Mr. Hurt, I`m the one that Mr. Trump doesn`t want to play here but I`ve spoke within Mr. Koch and our other playing partners and we`re going to leave.
First, we need to fetch our shoes from the locker rooms, our street shoes, and we`ll fetch our clubs and we`ve already called for the car to come up from the parking lot.
Orlando and a couple of his cohorts shadowed me as I was doing what I just described and then I left.
MELBER: So they walk you and Mr. Koch, as you say, off the golf course. You look at Donald Trump in this interaction. In your view, does he have an understanding of why this kind of conduct, while legal on a private golf course, would be illegal if he did it on government property or when he is president? Is he ready to take on those limitations?
HURT: Well, I don`t think that he is, Ari. And here`s why. You, as a legal scholar, of course, remember the McCarthy hearings back in the `50s, and the lead attorney for Joe McCarthy was a fellow named Roy Cohn. One of the biggest influences, besides his own father, Fred Trump, when Donald Trump was coming up, was his attorney Roy Cohn.
So I think that there`s probably some gaps in understanding about what he legally may do and may not do, but I also think that he learned smear tactics and bill of rights violation tactics from a master who was Roy Cohn.
MELBER: And briefly, finally, in your post about this on Facebook you wrote that David Koch was appalled. He branded Trump petty and vulgar.
Did he say anything else to you?
HURT: Well, I`m going to let David Koch speak for himself. He`s a dear friend and a golfing buddy. I think that Donald`s behavior certainly speaks for itself.
MELBER: Do you think he`d ever been booted from a course before, though?
HURT: Have I?
MELBER: No, do you David Koch had ever been booted off a golf course?
HURT: Well, it was really not David who was booted, I was the one who was booted.
I offered to taken an Uber so David and our other playing companions could stay there, but they said, all of them together, the other three said, no, no, we came as a foursome, we shall leave as a foursome and we went to play Emerald Dunes which, in my view, is a much, much better golf course.
MELBER: All right. Well, we got your views on all that and it sounds like Mr. Koch felt you danced with the one who brung ya and you all left together. An interesting story, small or large depending on where it all goes. Harry Hurt, thanks for your time tonight.
HURT: Thank you, Ari.
MELBER: Appreciate it.
Now, we are continuing to follow those protests and arrests we reported on earlier in the hour at the Alabama office of Senator Jeff Sessions, Trump`s nominee for attorney general.
Joining me now by phone is Larry Cohn. He`s the chair of the Democracy Initiative, which is a coalition that has opposed Session`s nomination and the NAACP is a participating organization. What can you tell us?
LARRY COHEN, DEMOCRACY INITIATIVE: Our board meets tomorrow night. Cornell Brooks is actually on that board. We`re joined by phone. We will escalate the opposition that we saw tonight from the Alabama NAACP and the national president, Cornell Brooks sitting in there.
Jeff Sessions may be the worst attorney general nomination ever, which is saying a lot. He has made racist comments, he has attacked civil rights groups, he`s created voter fraud that didn`t exist. This is as a U.S. attorney, as the attorney general of Alabama, and this is not somebody who deserves a rushed confirmation with a hearing next week before he`s even nominated and a voice vote.
We are going to demand -- and there`s 30 million members of the Democracy Initiative groups -- labor, green, civil rights, women`s organizations, that there are full hearings, that he`s totally vetted and that the Senate -- the opponents to people like Jeff Sessions in the Senate need to speak up and use the 30 hours of debate time that are there for every nominee.
MELBER: Do you think democrats are on the same page as you in your protesters, or is this an effort to, as you say, escalate attention on this nomination?
COHEN: This is to bring attention to the nomination. These are nominations that the president-elect is trying to ram through with his supporters in the Senate before he`s even the president of the United States. Again, they`re anticipating a voice vote of the Judiciary committee right after the inauguration.
And what the Democracy Initiative will be saying, and our member organizations is wait a minute here. This guy does not deserve a voice vote and does not deserve to be rushed through as the next attorney general of the United States at a time when people are in fear about their rights, at a time when the whole world is looking to see what will it be like in the United States with Donald Trump as president?
MELBER: And, Larry, last night on this program, we had a spokesperson for Jeff Sessions on who said that a lot of this in their view is an effort to smear him as a racist without facts. What is your response to that, briefly?
COHEN: That`s why there should be a full hearing where people can testify, where we look at the record of Jeff Sessions and the record should speak for itself.
MELBER: Anything else that you want people to know from here? What happens tomorrow given the arrests tonight?
COHEN: Tomorrow, organizations across this country are going to take up this opposition inspired by the NAACP and we would hope that people across this country would stand up and shout out no to Jeff Sessions and no to a rush jam job confirming him.
MELBER: All right, Larry Cohen, I know this is a busy night given everything happening there. Appreciate your time.
I am Ari Melber, and appreciate your time at home for watching ALL IN this evening. ""THE RACHEL MADDOW SHOW"" starts right now. Good evening, Rachel.
THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED."
0	59	 60 von 72	MSNBC	January 3, 2017 Tuesday	 HARDBALL	 5:00 PM EST	"HIGHLIGHT: Congressman Republicans acted last night to drastically curtail the powers of the independent Office of Congressional Ethics, and then Trump Tweeted his disapproval and they dropped it. After eight years of stonewalling and blocking President Obama, it`s now the Republican Party`s turn to put up or shut up. For the first time in a decade, Republicans now control both houses of Congress and the White House

"	"CHRIS MATTHEWS, HOST: Trump trumps.
Let`s play HARDBALL.
Good evening. I`m Chris Matthews in Washington, which is now the scene of the action.
For quite a while now, we`ve wondered who will call the shots on the Republican side of this city. Will it be Republican power base in Congress, which has been raring to go with its own agenda for years? Will it be Donald Trump, who takes office in 17 days from now, but is already governing by tweet?
Well, earlier today, we got an answer. The Republicans acted last night to drastically curtail the powers of the independent Office of Congressional Ethics, bringing it under the tight supervision of members of Congress themselves.
That is, until President-elect Trump tweeted the following this morning. ""With all that Congress has to work on, do they really have to make the weakening of the independent ethics watchdog, as unfair as it is or may be, their number one act in priority? Focus on tax reform, health care and so many other things of far greater importance. Drain the swamp."" 
Well, that tweet went out, well, just around 10:00 AM this morning, a little after. Within the hour, at 10:50 AM, House Republicans scheduled an emergency meeting for 11:50 AM, at which time they decided to back off their amendment, leaving the OCE in place as an independent body.
I`m joined right now by NBC`s Hallie Jackson. And of course, Hallie, the question to you -- and maybe it`s too big a question -- would this have happened, would the Republicans stop their effort to basically gut the Office of Congressional Ethics had not Trump tweeted?
HALLIE JACKSON, NBC CORRESPONDENT: Here`s what I`m going to say in answer to your very big question, Chris. I do think that the tweet from the president-elect, him weighing in on this issue that had bubbled up starting the night before did have some part in this, right?
But I would be very hesitant in ascribing too much sort of cause and effect relationship here. Remember that there started to come sort of a build-up of outrage even late on Monday when this first started happening. You saw it build throughout the morning. You saw, for example, on the morning shows Donald Trump`s top advisers being pressured about this themselves.
So I think that the build-up, sort of the bubbling outrage that existed publicly was already starting come into play. I don`t think it helped, obviously, that Donald Trump tweeted this. But remember, Chris, he wasn`t tweeting against the actual action of gutting the independent ethics committee here, he was tweeting about the timing of it. He didn`t like that the timing of it was overshadowing moves potentially on health care or on tax reformer, as you just read in that tweet.
So I don`t think that you can link necessarily a cause and effect relationship between this, although I will say that, clearly, there was discussion about the president-elect`s reaction with House Republicans in the morning before this sort of flip-flop on the OCE.
MATTHEWS: Did you get any indication as a reporter from the House Republican leadership that they were going to reverse themselves on this until we heard from Trump in his tweet?
JACKSON: Here`s the thing...
MATTHEWS: Was there any sign...
JACKSON: Yes.
MATTHEWS: ... they were going to do that?
JACKSON: Here`s what I would say. Paul Ryan didn`t like this. He doesn`t like this. He was never (ph) against this. Now, Kevin McCarthy, another House leader, he -- he was opposed to it, according to our sources in the room the night before. This morning, he seemed to be striking a little bit of a different tune.
But I will say that at the very top, there was no appetite to do this because of...
MATTHEWS: I know.
JACKSON: ... the exact perception that this had to people, right, the idea that Donald Trump is coming in in 17 days from now to drain the swamp, and yet here you have members of Congress doing something that a lot of folks perceive -- and I will tell you that ethics lawyers that I talked to on both sides of the aisle, Democrat and Republican, who said, This is ridiculous. This is, as one person said to me -- this -- these are the foxes guarding the henhouse here.
MATTHEWS: Yes. Well, I think Trump looks good on this one. Anyway, thank you, Hallie Jackson.
Well, anyway, the attempt to gut the OCE, the Office of Congressional Ethics, was originally spearheaded by the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, Congressman Robert Goodlatte of Virginia. And a majority of the Republican conference approved that change without debate.
A key criticism was that the OCE, the Office of Congressman Ethics, leaked anonymous allegations. According to Politico, quote, ""The vote was orchestrated by several members who felt they had been wrongfully accused of unethical behavior by the OCE, according to several sources in the room.""
I`m joined right now by Republican strategist John Feehery. Nothing is black and white, and I`ve done a lot of talking to people on the Hill today.
JOHN FEEHERY, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST: Right.
MATTHEWS: And I get the sense that most members of Congress on both sides don`t like this Office of Congressional Ethics. They think it leaks. They think it puts out anonymous criticisms without any chance for due process.
That said, once the word went out that Congress is covering up, they`re trying to get rid of the only watchdog outside the body that`s willing to go after corruption, if there is any, they looked so bad, they`re all running for cover.
FEEHERY: Listen, I remember...
MATTHEWS: And it was Trump that blew the whistle.
FEEHERY: I remember in 2005, when we tried to fix the ethics process for Tom DeLay, and it was a complete disaster. If you`re going to try to fix an ethics process, you have to do it in a bipartisan way, which means you can`t do it on the opening day of Rules, because that`s automatically a partisan vote.
You also need to get the leaders on both sides for it. Paul Ryan was against it. So was Nancy Pelosi. This is a rebellion from...
MATTHEWS: They were against getting rid of it.
FEEHERY: They were -- because they knew. They saw the optics. And of course, Donald Trump -- he gets this. And I thought it was actually a very sophisticated tweet he put out, which was, This is (INAUDIBLE) probably not that good, but don`t do it now. You`re screwing up my agenda.
MATTHEWS: Yes.
FEEHERY: Which I thought was really smart of him because he`s giving some credibility to the members who are against this, and they so have some really valid criticisms. This thing is out of control.
MATTHEWS: Well, I`m going back to the question it put to Hallie Jackson up on the Hill. And she knows her stuff. She says it`s kind of hard to answer the question because although -- I look at sequences and I look at the way things are. And when you say at 10:00 o`clock in the morning, Trump blows the whistle on this thing and tweets that we can`t do this, and then by 10:50, they`re putting out a emergency meeting call -- there was no call for an emergency meeting before the tweet.
FEEHERY: List, this was a home run for Donald Trump. It was a softball that he could hit out of the park and he could get it -- I think he killed it easily. It was him who did it. Ryan tried to stop it. I think he was happy to see it dead because they have to focus on other things. This is not the way they wanted to start (INAUDIBLE)
MATTHEWS: OK, let`s talk about how this thing boomerangs later on. I thought Kellyanne Conway said something smart during the campaign, among other things I think she did. She said people care more about what affects them than what offends them. So they were willing to walk past -- I think a lot of women, too -- the awful stuff Trump said on the bus there with Billy Bush. They said, OK, that`s boorish. You know, I`ve heard it from other people, too. It`s disgusting. But I got to pick a president.
So they picked a president based on what was going to affect them. Well, if you kill health care for 20 or some million people, people, diabetics like myself who need health care, they need the pharmaceuticals and all the other stuff, the insulin -- you kill it for them, that`s affecting them.
So do the Republicans have the cojones to go out there and get rid of ""Obama care"" without a ready replacement? And that`s what I wonder about how they`re -- (INAUDIBLE) organized right now. The fact that they would do this thing overnight without really thinking it through, the optics or the (INAUDIBLE)
FEEHERY: Right.
MATTHEWS: ... are they going to have their act together to replace ""Obama care"" or...
FEEHERY: They are going to -- they`re going to repeal it immediately and replace it slowly...
MATTHEWS: Well, what about the people who are exposed?
FEEHERY: They`re going to take care of the people exposed until they come up with a...
MATTHEWS: They are?
FEEHERY: It`s going to take a while. I`ve talked to congressional staff on both sides. This is not going to be an easy process. But the first process, repeal, is going to be easy. Replace is going to be hard, but it`s going to take a while...
MATTHEWS: What happens if...
(CROSSTALK)
MATTHEWS: ... and you got 20 million people out there who are without health care?
FEEHERY: Well, they`re not going to take that health care away right away. As a matter of fact, it would be -- the repeal`s going to be phased out. There`s going to be a deadline...
MATTHEWS: How do you -- where do you get this surety (ph) from?
FEEHERY: Well, I get it from leaders on both sides, and I think it`s going to be one of the first things they -- they -- they do.
MATTHEWS: Because all I hear is the rumbling of the Republican caucus in Congress, in the House especially, that has been raring to go for a long time. They got their agenda and their agenda says, Eliminate ""Obama care."" It doesn`t say replace, it says eliminate.
FEEHERY: No, what it says is they have no choice but to replace it because you can`t throw those 20 million people out because...
MATTHEWS: Do they know that?
FEEHERY: They do know that. They know that in their bones because they know -- most -- a lot of those people live in their districts. And so this is...
MATTHEWS: Did they know that killing an outside watchdog group on ethics would look terrible on the morning shows this morning?
FEEHERY: I think that Paul Ryan knew. And I think...
MATTHEWS: Well, what about the rank and file?
FEEHERY: I think the rank and file in the room thought that this process at the OCE was terrible. I think that`s true on both sides.
MATTHEWS: Yes.
FEEHERY: There are a lot of people -- a lot of Democrats feel...
(CROSSTALK)
MATTHEWS: You know who`s going to get blamed on this? The House Republicans. (INAUDIBLE) going to look on this, the guy...
FEEHERY: No, they`re not going to get blamed because it`s a done story after two days. No one`s going to talk about this because they didn`t actually do it.
MATTHEWS: OK, we`ll see. Thank you, John Feehery -- making a good argument.
I mentioned, by the way -- as I mentioned, the measure originally passed in a meeting of Republican conference people yesterday, over the night, reportedly, despite the objection of House leaders at a press gaggle, by the way, today, House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy was asked how that reflected on him. Let`s listen.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: If you did really oppose it, why were you not able to stop it in some way? Doesn`t that suggest that you`re very weak leaders of the conference?
REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA), MAJORITY LEADER: Ann (ph), welcome back.
(LAUGHTER)
MCCARTHY: (INAUDIBLE) I have my house, I got my wife and my two kids, and I usually don`t win (ph) what we watch on TV. So you can put whatever spin you want on that. But I don`t get (ph) to win (ph) everything (INAUDIBLE) life (ph), and that`s not the way our government is designed to work. So I think that`s rather healthy.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
MATTHEWS: Well, meanwhile, in his first speech as Senate minority leader, Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York vowed to hold Donald Trump and his allies in Congress accountable. And here`s Schumer.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY), MINORITY LEADER: We will hold President-elect Trump accountable to the values that truly make America great. But we`ll fight him tooth and nail when he appeals to the baser instincts that diminish America and its greatness. That is our challenge. That is our charge. And we rise to meet it.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
MATTHEWS: I`m joined right now by Democratic senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut. Thank you, Senator.
Well, first of all, let`s deal with the thing, the mess, the mishegoss we were talking about a minute ago, and that`s -- the House Republicans being caught in the act of getting rid of the ethics panel that looks out at them and keeps charge of them. They`re getting rid of the only guard on their ethics from outside, so they get to decide whether they`re ethical or not. It looks terrible. And it looks good for Trump what (ph) anybody now thinking who`s watching right now. When you`re swift enough to jump on something that looks terrible, call it out, blow the whistle, you look good.
SEN. CHRIS MURPHY (D), CONNECTICUT: Yes, well, I was one of the authors of that original ethics reform back in 2008, and it was a great deal before there was independent watchdog because members of Congress on both sides basically had a deal that we won`t investigate each other, that complaints will be made but we`ll kind of shelve it so that neither Republicans or Democrats get in trouble.
It was -- here`s how you parse Trump`s tweet. He probably had something with Republicans shelving it today, but the fact that he essentially said it`s OK to do this later on means that, you know, when folks aren`t looking in the dead of a Thursday night or Friday night, this could get slipped through sometime in February or March. So he essentially invited Republicans to just make this change later on.
MATTHEWS: Well, he said don`t do it now. Do you think that implies he says do it later?
MURPHY: Yes. I mean, I think those words were chosen pretty carefully.
MATTHEWS: Where do you get that out of what he said? Where`d he say that?
MURPHY: He said, Don`t make this a priority, right? He said, Work on the things that I care about. And then if you want to do this in the spring or the summer, maybe I`m not going to make such a stink out of it.
MATTHEWS: Did he say that?
MURPHY: I`ll give him credit if he...
MATTHEWS: Did he say that? I didn`t hear him say that. He didn`t say do it...
(CROSSTALK)
MURPHY: He didn`t say don`t do this, he said don`t make this your priority...
MATTHEWS: OK.
MURPHY: I pay attention to the words that he uses.
MATTHEWS: Oh, I think he wants to be a little bit like a wet noodle, not with a whip.
Anyway, let me ask you about your strategy as a Democrat. Are you running for president, by the way? I`m curious. I think you are. Are you thinking about the presidency in 2020?
MURPHY: No, I`m not. I have to get reelected in two years!
MATTHEWS: You`re not at all?
(CROSSTALK)
MURPHY: No, I`m not!
MATTHEWS: Well, that`s the first step.
MURPHY: Yes, well, I`m thinking about stopping the disaster that`s going to occur to Americans...
MATTHEWS: OK. All right. Well, that`s...
MURPHY: ... if the things that Trump is proposing get through.
MATTHEWS: That`s your job. I accept that. Well, let`s talk about that job right now. I`m watching Schumer. He`s a hard guy to figure out. I know he`s very pro-Israeli, a couple issues he`s had, certainly, with Secretary Kerry. You have, as well. So I try to figure out -- he`s a New York senator. (INAUDIBLE) represent New York.
He also has to find the difference between (INAUDIBLE) he just looks like an obstructionist, like Mitch McConnell, who just sat around like a troll under the bridge, ready to bite the leg of Obama for four or eight years. You don`t want to look like that guy.
Do you want to be that guy? Do the Democrats want to be obstructionists, pure obstructionists but not get caught at it, or do they want to look for places where they can agree with Trump? Where are they going to go here?
MURPHY: Well, I think it was a unique political benefit to Mitch McConnell in obstructing Barack Obama because Barack Obama`s entire pledge was he was going to fix Washington.
MATTHEWS: I know.
MURPHY: He was going to bring the two parties together, right? So Trump`s pitch is different. His pitch is that, I alone can fix this. And so it`s results, it`s impacts people`s lives that matter. So I don`t think that there`s the political benefit to Democrat to obstruct everything he does. I think right now, you sort of put out open arms to him and you say, If you`re willing to come meet us halfway, we`ll work with you.
I don`t see that invitation coming. I just don`t see Trump`s move coming to try to work with us on infrastructure or tax reform. So I think that we can be open to those overtures. I would just be really surprised if they ultimately show up.
I think Republicans are going to shove some stuff through on these reconciliation votes, and then maybe pack it in for the year. And our focus is going to have to be explaining to the people the utter grave damage that`s going to be done to their lives if that happens.
MATTHEWS: OK. I`m talking about the guy and the woman up in Erie, Pennsylvania, or in Lackawanna Country or even (INAUDIBLE) that was split, but certainly, in Wilkes-Barre, they went big for Trump.
Is he going to do something for them? Is he going to actually do an infrastructure bill that puts people to work at real jobs? I mean, the Chinese, when they have to shut down their coal mines, they take the deep miners over there who work in deep holes and have them build subways, something else they can do in deep -- deep digging. Find a way to put guys to work who want to make real salaries. Do you think Trump is going to do that?
MURPHY: Well, those coal jobs are...
MATTHEWS: Will Republicans let him?
MURPHY: Those coal jobs aren`t coming back. His strategy now...
MATTHEWS: Not the coal jobs, I`m talking about jobs for guys and women who want to work hard and sweat and get dirty, those kind of jobs in factories. Will we have those kind of jobs coming in building -- rebuilding our bridges, our subways, our highways? Is that going to happen?
MURPHY: Not the way that he`s doing it right now, right? He`s doing -- he`s doing economic development nationally on a one company by one company basis. That ultimately doesn`t deliver the kind of jobs that we need, right?
MATTHEWS: That`s (INAUDIBLE)
MURPHY: So you need -- right, but it`s all theatrics. But so far, there`s been absolutely no sign that he`s willing to engage in policies...
MATTHEWS: Oh, OK. Well, I...
MURPHY: ... that will actually bring these jobs back.
MATTHEWS: ... think you guys ought to remind him that he said LaGuardia`s a dump, Penn Station`s a dump, a lot these -- I was just over in India. They got better-looking airports than we do. Why do we have this -- this pathetic transportation system in this country? Amtrak -- there`s not a country in the world that I`ve been to that doesn`t have a better state-of- the-art train system than we do! And we`re the best country in the world!
MURPHY: No, it takes longer to...
MATTHEWS: Why don`t we?
MURPHY: No, it takes longer to get from New Haven to New York today than it did 100 years ago. But the fact of the matter is this fantasy infrastructure proposal that he`s put on the table today, which relies on 100 percent...
MATTHEWS: Well, why don`t you guys have a bigger one?
MURPHY: ... private financing...
MATTHEWS: Why don`t you put forward a big one?
MURPHY: ... it isn`t going to work.
MATTHEWS: Why don`t you Democrats be Democrats and create jobs?
MURPHY: We have put on the table a massive public-private partnership, an infrastructure bank that would put public dollars next to private dollars. If he picks that up off the table, then we have something to work with.
MATTHEWS: OK.
MURPHY: Right now, I don`t think that his secretary of commerce is going to let him do that.
MATTHEWS: Oh, I think it`s time for you guys to write some op-eds in the big papers, get the word out, start giving speeches, hold rallies and create jobs.
Thank you, Senator Chris Murphy. I think you are running for president, but it takes a couple years. You got to get reelected first.
Coming up -- Chuck Schumer tells Donald Trump, You can`t have a Twitter presidency. Trump`s at it again, however, tweeting about China, North Korea, trade and Guantanamo Bay. What do these tweets tell us about how Trump actually views the world. And where`s that inside information Trump said he had on the election hacking? That`s all ahead.
Plus, the Joe Show. It`s the last time we got to see -- or get to see Vice President Joe Biden doing something he does better than anybody and his personal touch as he swears in the new Senate. We`ll see some of that coming up.
And it`s put up or shut up time for the Republicans. Now that they`re taking control of Congress and the White House, they`re completely accountable now. If they kill ""Obama care,"" oh, they own what`s left. If we don`t get an infrastructure bill, as I said, they`ll know it in Erie and other Trump bastions. The HARDBALL roundtable`s coming here.
Finally, let me finish with ""Trump Watch"" for tonight.
And this is HARDBALL, the place for politics.
(NEWSBREAK)
MATTHEWS: Welcome back to HARDBALL.
Well, Donald Trump`s primary mode of communication even on foreign policy and national security matters is Twitter. And earlier today, the future commander in chief tweeted: ""There should be no further releases from Gitmo. These are extremely dangerous people and should not be allowed back on to the battlefield.""
Well, yesterday, Trump issued this warning to Kim Jong-un -- quote -- ""North Korea just stated that it is in the final stages of developing a nuclear weapon capable of reaching parts of the United States. It won`t happen!""
That`s what he said. Meanwhile, he sarcastically started tweet about China`s role in that crisis North Korea -- quote -- ""China has been taking out massive amounts of money and wealth from in U.S. in totally one-sided trade, but won`t help with North Korea. Nice.""
That`s what he did.
Anyway, in the past several weeks, Trump has also tweeted criticism of the United Nations, opposition to President Obama`s policy on Israel, a call to strengthen and expand U.S. nuclear capability, and, of course, praise for Vladimir Putin.
Well, today, incoming Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer criticized Trump`s Twitter practice. Let`s watch him.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
SEN. CHARLES SCHUMER (D), NEW YORK: Tweeting -- quote -- ""Very smart"" to Vladimir Putin for ignoring American sanctions is no foreign policy. America doesn`t conduct foreign policy by tweet.
Conducting foreign policy by tweet, while spurning vital intelligence briefings that lay out the real emerging threats around the world, that should alarm Democrats and Republicans alike.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
MATTHEWS: Well, I`m joined right now by ""The Washington Post"" columnist Eugene Robinson and former chair of the Republican National Committee Michael Steele. Both are MSNBC analysts.
And what we need right now are some analysts right now.
EUGENE ROBINSON, MSNBC POLITICAL ANALYST: I`m sorry. I`m busy tweeting.
(CROSSTALK)
MATTHEWS: I`m not a tweeter, but I know I have to do it as part of the show, but I don`t do much tweeting.
I think the danger of tweeting is that there`s no deliberation to it, it seems.
MICHAEL STEELE, MSNBC POLITICAL ANALYST: It`s a reactive medium. It`s a reactive medium.
You can cause a reaction, or you can react to something else.
ROBINSON: React to something, right.
STEELE: It`s full exposure, number one. Number two, you can`t tell whether or not you`re serious or you`re sarcastic.
MATTHEWS: Well, sarcasm doesn`t work in the world.
(CROSSTALK)
ROBINSON: It especially does not work in diplomacy with North Korea, right?
How is Kim Jong-un to read that tweet. Right? Is this a formal diplomatic demarche from the United States? Is this the formal position of the incoming U.S. administration, or is it just Trump blowing off steam?
(CROSSTALK)
MATTHEWS: Let`s go back into history. We went into -- we went up the Yalu River in the Korean War and the Chinese got the thought, oh, they are coming to get us. They`re going to coming to get out, thinking we were being strategic.
But we weren`t coming to get them. We were just trying to take off Korea and give it back to the democrats over there, whatever you want to call them at that time. They were not exactly democrats, but get the communists out of there.
But the older world -- and it`s still the older world -- seems to take our actions as strategic and thoughtful and deliberative, when, in fact, they`re impulsive. Even back then, they were impulsive.
And what are they going to make of Trump, who seems to me he gets up in the morning one day and he goes, you know, I smell trouble for this ethics thing we`re doing here, so I`m going to blow the whistle on it? And he does it like in the moment.
STEELE: The impulsiveness of it is, though, is the danger spot, because how foreign leaders read that impulsiveness matters.
And I think what folks in the White House are having an interesting time trying to figure out is, OK, when we get up at 3:00, 4:00, I mean, 4:00 or 5:00 in the morning to get to the White House to start the day, the first thing we have to be concerned about what was tweeted...
(CROSSTALK)
ROBINSON: What did the president tweet, right?
STEELE: At 2:00 or 3:00.
MATTHEWS: Suppose you work for him. How do you speak for him?
How do the people around him -- Kellyanne Conway gets up this morning and goes to the morning shows, ""GMA"" and ""Today"" and ""Joe,"" and she does the shows and give the current policy from Trump and the Republican Party, which is, we don`t need this ethics panel, this outside ethics panel. We`re going to move ahead and cut it off a bit.
And the next thing she knows, Trump is tweeting in the other direction. How do you coordinate this stuff?
ROBINSON: She didn`t know.
MATTHEWS: Because he didn`t tell her.
ROBINSON: I was on ""Joe"" with her this morning and she just didn`t know. So, she kind of vamped. She didn`t say much of anything, because she couldn`t say much of anything. She had no idea which way Trump was going to go. She hadn`t talked to him yet.
So, now we know which way he went. But that`s a terrible position to put anybody speaking for the administration in. The other thing about Twitter is the sort of clipped, and because it`s clipped, imprecise nature of Twitter language. It can be ambiguous and this and that.
A lot of time and effort is spent in diplomacy, in all diplomacy, trying to make sure there`s no misunderstanding, trying to make sure everybody understands what I`m saying and what you`re saying.
(CROSSTALK)
MATTHEWS: We don`t have the talent for that, because the old days, when you had to report before we had Western Union and people were reporting on that, but they were writing, they were speaking in cabelese, shorter words, getting rid of unnecessary words.
But the editor knew what you meant. It was always clear. He could straighten it out. But we don`t know what these -- what`s nice mean?
(CROSSTALK)
MATTHEWS: What do you say to Chinese when you say nice? Screw you, it means.
ROBINSON: Yes.
MATTHEWS: So, what do Chinese old guys sitting over there -- and they`re not older anymore. They`re younger leadership. And they have to, what did he mean by nice?
STEELE: Well, maybe part of it for the Chinese and for the North Koreans, the Iranians or anyone else that he is tweeting about, is that they do discount it. They see it as a reactive thing, because, remember, it`s not just president himself.
There are whole other back channels of conversation that are going on. So, when the president does tweet nice in response to something the Chinese have done or said, they will be -- it goes to your first point about how easy it will be for the insiders inside the White House to decode that for the Chinese and others on the back channels of diplomacy, because you can`t take it at face value, to Gene`s point, because you don`t know exactly, precisely what it means.
(CROSSTALK)
STEELE: You are talking about an industry, if you will, that`s all about precision.
ROBINSON: Imagine being an ambassador where the Chinese foreign minister calls you in and says, what is this nice?
STEELE: Nice.
MATTHEWS: Well, let`s go to what we can call him on.
Over the weekend, Donald Trump promised a revelation Tuesday or Wednesday of this week about Russia`s interference with U.S. elections.
Let`s watch a recent commitment by the president-elect and decide if he is going to meet this in the next 24 hours.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENT-ELECT: I know a lot about hacking, and hacking is a very hard thing to prove. So it could be somebody else. And I also know things that other people don`t know. And so they cannot be sure of the situation.
QUESTION: What do you know that other people don`t know?
TRUMP: You will find out on Tuesday or Wednesday.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
MATTHEWS: ""You will find out on Tuesday or Wednesday.
Well, last night, I asked Trump`s newly appointed counselor, Kellyanne Conway, about that statement. Let`s listen.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
MATTHEWS: Is that still a go, Kellyanne? We`re going to hear tomorrow or the next day about what the president-elect knows about hacking?
KELLYANNE CONWAY, TRUMP SENIOR ADVISER: Well, you may.
The key to all of that, Chris, is that the president-elect, in addition to the comments that he made there, I was there when he made them down in Palm Beach, he has agreed to have an intelligence briefing. And he will have that here at Trump Tower this week.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
MATTHEWS: What do you make about that, Gene? As an editor about news, is this on the day book? We`re going to hear tomorrow morning about this?
ROBINSON: Well, you may. And then I would kind of cut the rest, right, because the first two words were the message. That was the answer.
MATTHEWS: Vamping, I think you called it.
ROBINSON: And basically meant I don`t know.
STEELE: If you go back to the clip, he said he is going to have his briefing. And then he`s going to tell us what...
(CROSSTALK)
MATTHEWS: But he says he knows things that we don`t know.
(CROSSTALK)
STEELE: I think he is going to put it all together in context.
MATTHEWS: You are so gentle.
MATTHEWS: Anyway, Eugene Robinson and Michael Steele, who is getting soft on me.
Up next -- I`m sorry. You`re not soft.
Vintage Joe Biden today. We`re going to have some fund coming up, a little comic, joyous relief. It`s Joe Biden doing what he -- look at this, kissing on the -- he is unbelievable. He is like the uncle from the neighborhood. He`s unbelievable.
Anyway, you have got to watch Joe Biden from Delaware. Here he is. He`s coming up in a moment. We`re going to see sort of the last moments of Joe Biden as V.P.
And this is HARDBALL, the place for politics.
MATTHEWS: Welcome back to HARDBALL.
As the 115th Congress got down to business today, it was up to outgoing Vice President Joe -- and he really is outgoing -- Joe Biden to welcome the new Senate class.
For the former senator from Delaware, it was an opportunity to make new friends and perhaps say goodbye to old ones. Here he goes.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
JOSEPH BIDEN, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: It`s a great honor working with you.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes, you bet. You bet.
BIDEN: God love you.
John, thank you for being so nice to me. OK?
Well, you have got to be very patient. Fathers are hard to raise.
Good to see you, pal. Pennsylvania is in the House.
Got to get us all in.
When I die, I want to be reborn in Charleston.
I enjoyed being here more than anything.
Mom, I want to know what you`re drinking.
(LAUGHTER)
(END VIDEO CLIP)
MATTHEWS: Well, it was quintessential Joe Biden, and it`s something that has become somewhat of a hallmark for the man who has spent 30 years in the U.S. Senate working for Democratic causes.
For more, I`m joined by Steve McMahon, Democratic strategist, and Ruth Marcus, deputy editorial page editor for ""The Washington Post""
Ruth, you start. He has become uncle Joe. He`s a serious guy. He knows his issues. But he has become sort of loved. That`s rare in politics.
RUTH MARCUS, ""THE WASHINGTON POST"": He is loved because we see him operate in this space, which is his natural habitat. He is a born politician with a politician`s personality of just wanting to be with people and being outgoing.
The paradox of it is that his uncle Joe image is not actually -- as beloved as it has made him among many people, it`s not the image that he really wants to be known as.
MATTHEWS: I know.
MARCUS: He wants to be understood as the elder statesman.
MATTHEWS: He wants to be William Fulbright.
MARCUS: Yes.
MATTHEWS: He wants to be a real heady, long-headed guy.
Steve, tell me about that, because he`s always been a man -- I went up there and did a thing for him years ago up in Delaware, a town meeting. Just -- he asked me to come up and sort of moderate this thing. And they love him up there.
He is sort of a classic Tip O`Neill kind of guy, to be honest, an old street corner guy that people all know personally and like him. He`s not - - he`s never been able to command the national stage, however, the way I think Ruth said he wants to do.
STEVE MCMAHON, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST: He is a lot like Tip O`Neill, and another person that I worked for, Ted Kennedy, somebody who is quintessential politician.
He knows things about people. He asks about their family. He asks about their parents. And he is just the sort of old-school, back-slapping, fun- loving political guy that everybody like to be around, that every party is richer when they`re present, and every Senate is -- benefits from their presence as well, because he is a guy who had relationships, who could cut deals across the aisle, who his colleagues trusted, including Republicans like Mitch McConnell.
He was really a remarkable senator.
MATTHEWS: Yes, I don`t think people saw him as elitist.
He didn`t go to an Ivy School league. He doesn`t act like a big intellectual. But he would call me at least one time during the campaign and said, these people around here don`t get it. And he meant everybody, Obama, everybody. They don`t get this Trump guy. They don`t know why people are voting for him.
He did get it. And I wonder whether he could have been -- I hate the word used -- be used more effectively. Hillary sent him up to Scranton, sent him around as her surrogate in a way, but it wasn`t really making the point that they all got it. They didn`t hear what people were yelling about.
MARCUS: And he -- it`s easy in hindsight, but he has talked after the election...
MATTHEWS: He talked before it, too.
MARCUS: ... about how he was worried that she didn`t -- wasn`t hearing the voice of the middle class, that they didn`t have a message for the middle class, that she was not really attuned to it.
And it was a very agonizing choice for him to decide not to run. And he probably made the right choice for himself and his family.
MATTHEWS: I think so.
MARCUS: But it`s very difficult.
One of the things that really strikes me about Biden is the way in which he and Obama were very well matched in the sense that he made up with this kind of hail fellow, well met, bonhomie for Obama`s remoteness.
MATTHEWS: Oh, you`re so right.
MARCUS: So, they were a good pair.
MATTHEWS: I thought he was like -- in the old days, I think he was like Ed McMahon for Johnny Carson, because Johnny Carson was funny as hell, but he was aloof. He was cold.
And Ed McMahon was the guy next door. And the fact that Johnny hung out with a guy like Ed McMahon made us like Johnny more.
Anyway, what do you think about that and the ambitions of a guy who, when was he was very young , was elected to the United States Senate at 29, not even constitutionally able to take the oath yet? And he beat a guy who had been a two-term governor, three-term incumbent senator, congressman, everything, a guy that couldn`t be beat, and he beat the guy, Caleb Boggs.
And then he had a plan to run for president, and he just couldn`t do it.
Steve.
MCMAHON: Well, it`s interesting.
You`re absolutely right, Chris. The guy next door is exactly the persona that Joe Biden was so adept at projecting, and it`s why people trusted him and liked him so much. He was elected to the Senate when he was 29, as you pointed out.
And from the moment he got there, people thought, watch Joe Biden. That guy is going to be president one day. And I think Joe Biden felt that. He had a great start in 1988. He actually was a rocket ship in Iowa, until he had his Neil Kinnock plagiarism problem.
He learned from that. He came back in 2008. I think he ran a campaign that was a pretty good campaign, but he was running against an exceptional field. And I think it was difficult for him to take a pass on this last one, because it was what he had lived his whole life to do, and it`s what he thought he always would be, which is president.
And I think if you talk about Northern industrial states that Donald Trump won, he won those states because he exuded Joe Biden exudes every single day. He could go up there and say to people, you know what? I may not agree with you on every policy, but I know exactly what you`re feeling and I`m going to do something about it. I`m going to be with you and I`m going to feel it every single day.
And people believed him when he said that.
MATTHEWS: Yes. And he never did stuff like some of these pols do, like Mitt Romney saying the 47 percent or President Obama saying things like the people who cling to their guns and their religion, or they`re deplorables.
Joe Biden never talked down to people. And that`s what politicians ought to stop doing. Whatever you think of somebody`s different views, stop thinking of yourself as morally superior to the voters, because they`re not going to like it, as we have seen.
Thank you, Steve McMahon. Thank you, Ruth Marcus.
Up next: Republicans take the reins, and now it`s put-up-or-shut-up time for the GOP. The roundtable is coming here next.
You`re watching HARDBALL, the place for politics.
CHRIS MATTHEWS, MSNBC ANCHOR: Welcome back to HARDBALL.
Well, after eight years of stonewalling and blocking President Obama, it`s now the Republican Party`s turn to put up or shut up. For the first time in a decade, Republicans now control both houses of Congress and the White House. And in their march to power they made promises they will be forced to deliver on. We`re going to make them do it, by the way.
As Carl Hulse of ""The New York Times"", ""There`s little room for failure if they hope to satisfy their impatient constituents and deliver on bold promises to reshape the nation`s health care delivery system, restructure the tax code, drive job creation, muscle up American foreign policy, rebuild a crumbling infrastructure and set America on a new course, eight years of railing against the Obama administration has infused them and their constituents with the hostility and disregard for the government. The Republicans must lead rather than ridicule."" Well said.
Will GOP deliver on these big promises and will Democrats resist the Trump agenda as Republicans did to President Obama? They are two separate questions.
Here is what new Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said in his first floor speech he gave today as Democratic leader.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY), DEMOCRATIC LEADER: Mr. President it is not our job to be a rubber stamp. It`s our job to do what`s best for the American people, the middle class, and those struggling to get there.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
MATTHEWS: Well, let`s bring in the HARDBALL roundtable tonight. Heidi Przybyla, senior politics reporter for ""USA Today"", Margaret Carlson is a columnist for ""Bloomberg View"", and Ken Vogel is chief investigative reporter at ""Politico"".
I wanted to start around the room here. Doesn`t Trump and the Republican Party that now represents him whether they like it or not have to do big things in the next six months, because my experience, our experience is, if a president get it done in the first session, meaning before August, really, he ain`t going to get it done. So, infrastructure, replace Obamacare, do things that meet the promises he made.
HEIDI PRZYBYLA, USA TODAY: All presidents have to deliver especially this president, given that when you look across all of the variables in terms of performance, he`s performing about 20 points below both Obama, President Bush. Here`s the big question, though --
MATTHEWS: What do make of that? How do make the 20 points below?
PRZYBYLA: In terms of --
KEN VOGEL, POLITICO: Favorability ratings.
PRZYBYLA: Favorability ratings, but also competence on foreign policy, competence on handling the economy, I think trade was maybe one of the only areas --
MATTHEWS: So, you believe polls?
PRZYBYLA: I do believe national polls. I don`t believe (ph) the state polls.
(CROSSTALK)
MATTHEWS: Your point is that he is not convincing the people now that he is going to get something done.
PRZYBYLA: Right. The question is what is the deliverable? Is the deliverable what he promised on the campaign trail in terms of the populist agenda, on trade, and on bringing back jobs to the Rust Belt? Or is the deliverable the establishment Republican agenda that the leadership is now teeing up in terms of tax cuts and entitlement reform? That wasn`t what this election was about. That`s not the mandate.
MATTHEWS: That`s not what they wanted. That`s a Jerry Ford Republican platform. That`s the old ""cut everything, deregulate everything and make business happy"".
VOGEL: You know, we see him make moves towards that more traditional Republican position and away from some of his bold promises?
MATTHEWS: What is that going to do?
VOGEL: The wall in Mexico.
MATTHEWS: Come on. You`re kidding me.
(CROSSTALK)
MATTHEWS: Is he going to do something about illegal immigration? Is he going to do something about stopping it?
(CROSSTALK)
MATTHEWS: I`m sorry, you`re changing my how about me ask the question. Is he going to do anything about immigration or just ignore it? Can he ignore the issue he got elected on?
VOGEL: I mean, he has suggested that it was not -- the wall is not a big priority.
MATTHEWS: What about illegal immigration? It`s a priority with him.
VOGEL: I mean, you would think that his supporters, people who came out to vote for him, with that being the main issue, would incredibly discourage if he didn`t push that. Yet, we`ve seen that some of these people are willing to forgive him and --
MATTHEWS: I don`t agree, I don`t agree. Four years from now, we have illegal immigration like we`ve had for the last, since 1986, 11 million people coming in here. If that continues, is he going to be able to run for reelection on that? I don`t think so.
MARGARET CARLSON, BLOOMBERG VIEW: In the Democrats` DNA to do stuff and the Republicans not to. That`s why McConnell was successful in resisting Obama. Democrats won`t be that successful, because they want to do stuff.
Now, Republicans so far had their way, the establishment with Trump`s picks for the cabinet. I mean, it`s an incredibly establishment cabinet. But Trump is not an establishment player. I think it`s going to be -- he is going to be more in line with Bernie Sanders than with Mitch McConnell.
MATTHEWS: What does he do, though? What does he bargain along the lines of Bernie Sanders? Bernie Sanders would say redistribute wealth, give jobs to people who need them, put them to work, even have a government jobs program.
CARLSON: Well, he sees infrastructure that way. He -- Trump is not for entitlement, cutting entitlements. And we`re going to --
VOGEL: Trade --
CARLSON: Trade is another one. The Hill likes China, and not Russia. He likes Russia and not China.
And the other thing is, it`s going to be Trump care soon. Trump is not going to go along if it`s going -- if he is going to be egged way, do you remember Dan Rostenkowski when he catastrophic insurance, Trump does not want his name -- he doesn`t want to be responsible for a failed health care program. And you can`t keep what he wants to keep --
MATTHEWS: Margaret, great memory. That`s when they went after the chairman of the ways committee, the crowds went after him and tried to turn over his car. I mean, they tried to. That`s how mad the crowd gets when you give them a tax they get nothing out of.
PRZYBYLA: I just don`t know -- I don`t know that we know yet whether he is going to cave or whether he`s going to work with the establishment because it depends on who he`s talked to last, in some cases. For example, on infrastructure, the plan that`s now emerging on the Republican side is very tax cut. Democrats are never going to go for that, and even so, somebody at Heritage, or somewhere, must have gotten Trump`s ear because now he`s starting to call that big government spending and that he didn`t realize it.
So, I think it really depends, but he is great at reading the tea leaves, like we saw with this Office of Government Ethics. He was more than willing to roll a grenade --
MATTHEWS: Let me ask you a lot of questions. Does he believe that he can ignore the issues he ran on? Can he ignore doing something, whatever it is, about stopping illegal immigration, doing something about reproducing jobs in America, real jobs for men and women that pay good salaries and stopping stupid wars?
Those are the big three. That was the perfect storm that got him elected, I believe. Stupid wars under especially W, a failure to deal with immigration, which really bugs a lot of people, and third, no jobs for anybody because of trade and other economic development.
Does he -- I want to ask you a question. I want an answer on this. Does he believe he has to make good on the main three thrusts he got elected on? Does he have to deliver on that or not?
CARLSON: And I say a fourth one which is reforming the V.A. hospital.
MATTHEWS: Just answer the question. Does he have to deliver on what he ran on?
CARLSON: He is talking about the wall as a metaphor now and talking about E-verify and other things and a virtual wall.
MATTHEWS: Well, that`s real. That`s good.
CARLSON: So he going to do something about it, but it`s not going to be that wall.
MATTHEWS: OK, is he going to have to say I delivered on my promises? Does he have to --
VOGEL: I think the one -- I think that eventually yes, he will. And I think it could redound to the benefit of Democrats in 2018, as well as 2020. If he doesn`t, because he made all the promises, the Republican Party is in the process of realigning itself around this Trump brand of Republicanism, which is very different than the Republican orthodoxy. Look at infrastructure spending, that is certainly one of the things he is looking at. For a lot of the Republicans that`s totally anathema to their vision of sort of small government conservative.
MATTHEWS: I think he smart to leave Social Security alone and Medicare alone. Those are old Pennsylvanian. They`re old Ohio regular people out there are not ideologues. They like Medicare. And they like Social Security.
CARLSON: And he said he will leave it alone.
MATTHEWS: Leave it alone.
And these guys like Paul Ryan who are ideologues, the Ayn Rand types, they`re going to become -- everybody is going to become self-reliant or whatever, they`re crazy.
CARLSON: They`re giving themselves a shot.
MATTHEWS: You touch Social Security, you die.
Anyway, the roundtable is sticking with us.
And up next, these three will tell me something more I don`t know.
This is HARDBALL, the place for politics.
MATTHEWS: Well, as Republicans prepare to take control of the United States Senate and the White House, for the first time since 2006, here`s something to think about -- nearly two-thirds of the Republicans who will be serving in the House this year have never served with a Republican president, spent their entire careers fighting against President Obama. So, can the party of no become the party that builds? That`s my question.
HARDBALL back after this.
MATTHEWS: Back with the HARDBALL round table.
Heidi, tell me something.
PRZYBYLA: The Clintons confirmed apparently that they will be attending Donald Trump`s inauguration and this is in spite of the fact that a senior Clinton confidante told me today that Bill Clinton in particular remains red-faced angry, hopingly mad especially about the FBI and Russia, especially after that warrant came out.
MATTHEWS: I`m waiting for Hillary to run for governor of New York next time. That`s my prediction.
Go ahead.
They`re not going out as losers.
Go ahead.
VOGEL: Trump talked on the campaign trail a lot about how he didn`t need big donors. He specifically singled out the Koch brothers, well, we understand that at a dinner at Mar-a-Lago, just before Christmas, David Koch, Donald Trump had a conversation and Trump asked him, why he and his brother didn`t engage in the presidential campaign to help Donald Trump?
MATTHEWS: So, he wants the money.
VOGEL: So, clearly, still on his mind.
CARLSON: So, in my lunch at Mar-a-Lago, during my vacation --
MATTHEWS: Aren`t you an insider?
CARLSON: -- Trump just met with the heads of the Mayo Clinic, Cleveland Clinic and Hopkins, and his priority number four is to reform the V.A. And he`s also going to spend his first night sleeping in the Lincoln bedroom.
MATTHEWS: That will be interesting. Anyway, that`s kind of a scary bed, by the way.
CARLSON: It is. I mean, it`s an antique.
MATTHEWS: It looks like Dracula`s bed.
CARLSON: And there are ghost there.
MATTHEWS: I would expect if there are any ghosts in this planet, they might be in that room.
Heidi Przybyla, thank you, Ken Vogel and Margaret Carlson.
When we return, let me finish Trump watch. You`re watching HARDBALL, the place for politics.
MATTHEWS: Trump Watch, Tuesday, January 3rd, 2017.
Well, today, we learned the power of a tweet. We saw everything scramble in Washington within minutes of Mr. T singling his thoughts in the medium he likes most. But really, what do today`s events tell us about who`s in charge. Is it Trump who blew the whistle on Congress`s plan to gut that independent Office of Congressional Ethics, or is it the media who blew the whistle late last night and early this morning? Or was it the people getting their word to their member of Congress, getting good and mad, that they don`t like the idea of Congress giving top legislative priority in this New Year to freeing themselves from outside ethical vigilance?
Personally, I can`t remember a time when people were -- as they are now -- so violently opposed to any sign of government corruption. The term ""lobbyist"" now has become taboo. So, has any sign a member is engaged in breaking Congress`s ethical rules or trying to cover up such violations. It`s about cleaning the swamp. The close working relationship among those who helped senators and members of Congress raise reelection money and then return once they`re safely in office to lobby those same senators and members of Congress on behalf of their clients.
By raising his voice in protesting as the way things are in Washington, the way they`re usually done, Donald Trump has not only shown his ability to move the Republican Party but also that he retains the instinct on how to move it. People in the country don`t want to see politicians gets themselves free of tough outside oversight. They don`t.
And that`s HARDBALL for now. Thanks for being with us.
""ALL IN"" starts right now.
THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED."
0	60	 61 von 72	MSNBC	January 3, 2017 Tuesday	 MTP DAILY	 5:00 PM EST	"HIGHLIGHT: Democrats called out the GOP vote to eliminate the ethics` office. Leo Wise worked at the Congressional Ethics Office and describes how it ran when it first began. Trump states that Congress should focus on so many other things of far greater importance. A political panel discusses the upcoming Trump administration. What will be the impact of Trump-Putin ties? Another question is, will Democrats borrow from the GOP opposition playbook? More presidents of the President`s Club have now RSVP`d for the upcoming inauguration. First, to Carrier, then Boeing and Lockheed Martin now, General Motors each in the crosshairs of tweets from President-Elect Donald Trump; Republicans have started the ball rolling, again, on the effort to repeal ObamaCare. This time they have the vote on the president just signing the bill, but the bill that such repeal in motion was introduce today and the debate is expected to begin on the set up floor tomorrow.

"	"CHUCK TODD, MSNBC HOST: Yes, it`s Tuesday.
It`s Trump versus House Republicans, and round one goes to Trump.
(voice-over): Tonight, drain the swamp. House Republicans back down on gutting the ethics office after the president-elect`s social media slam.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY), U.S. SENATE MAJORITY LEADER: Yes, withdrawn. Yes.
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
TODD: Plus, Boeing, Carrier and now General Motors. How will corporate America deal with the new normal of Trump`s 140-character public shaming?
And, finally, it`s the Joe show. Live photo ops in the Senate may never be the same.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
JOE BIDEN, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Anybody else want to be sworn in?
(END VIDEO CLIP)
TODD: This is MTP DAILY and it starts right now.
Good evening, I`m Chuck Todd here in Washington. Happy new year. I`m back. Glad to be back. Welcome to another edition of MTP DAILY.
It`s opening day for a lot of us here. And for the new Republican Congress, school`s in session. And it appears Republicans learned their first lesson the hard way, especially when it comes to dealing with Donald Trump. Ethics and a public outcry.
But at the end of a wild day, we`re left with more questions than answers about what all the drama really means. And by the looks of things, we`re not the only ones.
Let me explain. On the eve of this new Congress, House Republicans held a vote behind closed doors to strip what was -- is known as the independent bipartisan Congressional ethics watchdog group called the Office of Congressional Ethics of its power.
That vote, after hours, on a federal holiday no less, and without the support of House leadership, was supposed to be ratified today in a larger passage of rules` bills. On the opening day of this new Congress.
Well, the effort, of course, blew up. But more than that, Republican leaders appear to have been cowed by Trump in their first act in the new Congress.
And here`s why. This morning, it looked like this effort to gut the ethics office was moving full steam ahead. Here`s House majority leader, Kevin McCarthy, this very morning before we heard from President-elect Trump.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA), U.S. MAJORITY LEADER: The reforms do not change the entity. The public still registers a complaint. They still do the work with the ethics` review. And it still goes forward to ethics, whether they should dismiss it or review it. Same thing as before as today.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
TODD: And House Speaker Paul Ryan initially put his best spin on things this morning, assuring the public of the following. Quote, ""This House will hold its members to the highest ethical standards, and the office will continue to operate independently to provide public accountability to Congress.""
Now, you need to remember, both Ryan and McCarthy, apparently, opposed this move behind closed doors last night which also makes you scratch your head, if that was the case. Why didn`t they exert some influence in power here to stop this in the first place?
Well, but then, around the same time as Ryan`s statement this morning, came Trump`s tweets. Quote, ""With all that Congress has to work on, do they really have to make the weakening of the independent ethics watchdog, as unfair as it may be, their number one act in priority? Focus on tax reform, health care, and so many other things of far greater importance.""
Well, within two hours of those tweets, House Republicans had withdrawn the effort, unanimously by the way.
But there`s more to this story than just ethics. Because if you`re still trying to figure out what the 2016 election was really about, today`s evidence that apparently are not alone. Because elected officials haven`t figured out the message that voters sent them.
Was it about draining the swamp? Was it about disruption of the way things are done in Washington? Was it simply about selective ethics, essentially, we`re here to clean up the party that we don`t belong to, ethically.
Everybody still seems to be grasping for that answer. But if you don`t play it right by ethics, it could bite you.
We`re going to move on and talk more about this. Joined now by Carl Hulse, who is the Chief Washington Correspondent for ""The New York Times."" He`s been covering Washington and government politics for 36 years. And, as I always like to say, the unofficial mayor of Capitol -- of the Capitol Hill Press Corps.
So, all right, let me start with this.
CARL HULSE, CHIEF WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT, ""THE NEW YORK TIMES"": Happy new year, Chuck.
TODD: Happy new year, sir. Nothing like getting Congress back into session to give us something to do.
HULSE: Not an audacious, not a great start there.
TODD: Let me start with this. Kevin McCarthy and Speaker Ryan, we`re told were against this move from the get-go. So, how the heck --
HULSE: Right.
TODD: -- did we get as far as we got before it got withdrawn?
HULSE: I think that`s what a lot of Republicans around town are scratching their head about. As I ran into them today and talked to them on the Hill and elsewhere. How did it get that far if Paul Ryan and Kevin McCarthy didn`t want this to happen? You know, where`s their power?
So, in some ways, I think that the way that this unraveled, reflects probably pretty badly on them for the start of this.
[17:05:01] You know, you talk to Republicans. They`ll say, well, we knew we were probably going to have to undo this. The Trump tweet, you know, wasn`t the deciding factor. We were getting tons of phone calls.
But, they do say that the decision came after the Trump tweet. So, the new message to Congress from the White House is obviously going to come in the form of Twitter rather than documents.
And, I mean, I think they`re mainly chagrinned. Honestly, that`s the word I would use --
TODD: Yes.
HULSE: -- talking about it. Here`s the big opening day. This is the start of their big united government and they totally stepped in it. It was a big fiasco.
And I think, you know, it was funny hearing some of the Republican members talking. I know they liked Trump`s tweets when he was taking on the media or people they didn`t like. I think finding out that it can be aimed at them was a new discovery and they`re like, wow, that guy really has a big bully pulpit.
I heard one member actually say he was a little scared of it. So, you know, that`s a shape of things to come.
TODD: Well, now, Carl, it just brings up this next question. So, you`re right. So, McCarthy and Ryan are against this. Couldn`t stop it. Trump does two tweets and he stops it.
HULSE: Right.
TODD: Who`s got a bigger constituency in the House Republican conference, Paul Ryan or --
HULSE: Or who are they really --
TODD: -- Trump?
HULSE: -- who are they afraid of, right?
TODD: Who are they more afraid -- that`s right. Who are they more fearful of politically, Paul Ryan or Donald Trump?
HULSE: I mean, I had one Republican say to me, you know, it was scary to him that Ryan and McCarthy would be so strongly against this. And then, their membership would go ahead anyway and do this.
You know, it`s hard to see that happening to Tip O`Neill or even to Mitch McConnell and John Cornyn in the Senate.
So, I think that Mr. Ryan and Mr. McCarthy have to probably take some steps to reestablish them. You know, who is running the House Republican caucus right now? Which seems to be the question we`ve been asking for about six years, by the way.
TODD: No, that`s a fair point.
HULSE: Who`s in charge of the House?
TODD: Let me ask you quickly on the -- on the ethics office itself.
HULSE: Sure.
TODD: Would you say that ethics -- that ethics investigations, the ethics committee, this office, would you say it was functioning very well before this episode?
HULSE: No, no. I`ve been saying that to people all day. You know this isn`t -- although the office of Congressional ethics has been a little tougher and willing to do things on the -- than the committee on ethics that has lawmakers.
You know, it`s not like the ethics enforcement in the House is this, you know, rabid law enforcement. It`s -- it just doesn`t work that way.
I think that they were -- they spent a lot of capital. It blew up in their face on trying to tamper something that really isn`t that huge a threat to them to begin with, honestly.
TODD: Carl Hulse. Mr. Mayor, good to see you.
HULSE: Thanks, Chuck.
TODD: Your term will never end, as far as I`m concerned.
HULSE: All right. All right.
TODD: All right, there you go. Thank you, sir.
I`m joined now by Leo Wise. He is the man who ran the Office of Congressional Ethics when it first began. And I thought it would be beneficial to at least understand the actual office we`re talking about here.
Mr. Wise, thank you, sir.
LEO WISE, ATTORNEY: My pleasure.
TODD: So, this is what Republicans wanted to do. We`re playing -- and this is what got passed last night. And I want you to help walk me through what this would have meant.
It was have stripped the offices that you ran of the following. The ability to investigate anonymous complaints, conduct reviews, free of interference from members of Congress, maybe referrals to law enforcement without, I guess, Ethics Committee approval and to publish your findings publicly.
If all these four powers were taken away, what`s the point of the office?
WISE: Well, I think there isn`t much left if those are taken away, particularly the published findings. I mean, that was the real genius in how this was set up. That the office would gather evidence, interview people, collect documents, find the facts, present those to the lawmakers.
And then, after a certain period of time, those facts became public, whether the committee chose to act or not.
And then, the public could judge for itself. The conduct of their elected officials, and then how the House dealt with that conduct. So, it was -- really it was about transparency, --
TODD: Sunshine.
WISE: -- throwing light on the kind of dark corners --
TODD: Good old fashioned sunshine. Hey, put the line in over there. And if everybody sees it and the public approves it after that, well, so be it.
WISE: Exactly.
TODD: Let me ask this. So, the creation of this. It was in 2008. And I guess the question is, in response to what? What was -- what did -- describe what you feel as if your charge was -- what was the -- what was broken that you were charged with fixing?
WISE: So, I think there were primarily two things. One was the sense that the public had no way to raise concerns about their members and their behavior with the institution.
TODD: So, let me pause you. Before the creation of this office, an average citizen could not file an ethics complaint?
WISE: They would have to have had a member agree to --
TODD: Do it for them.
WISE: Which, historically, almost never happens.
TODD: Of course.
WISE: For all the reasons that anybody would imagine.
[17:10:00] TODD: Right.
WISE: And then, once an allegation was made or a complaint was made and questions were raised, it was a black box. And nobody knew what happened.
You know, and prior to the office`s creation, there was the raft of scandals about Jack Abramoff and the members that went to prison over there, interactions with him. And nobody knew what was going on in the institution that was primarily responsible for policing --
TODD: The Ethics Committee was totally, basically, non-player during the Abramoff mess.
WISE: Well, nobody knew.
TODD: Right.
WISE: Right.
TODD: And that`s -- and that was the trigger. Is that fair to say?
WISE: Yes, I think that`s fair to say. And that`s why this was really about opening up the win -- a window to the process. Both on the front so that people could raise concerns and then on the back end to see what happened to him.
TODD: All right. Now, let me -- the chief concern of the average member of Congress, though, was the following. No due process and the fact that you get to publish your findings means guilty until proven innocent. What do you say to that?
WISE: So, on the due process question. In the two years I was there, there were -- there were no due process issues. Members had the right to address this board that voted on whether the case should move forward.
They couldn`t be compelled to testify. They couldn`t be subpoenaed for documents. All their involvement was voluntarily. They retained council. There really was no due process. There were no due process violations at all.
And in terms of the findings being published, I mean, these are the facts. The facts are the facts, right? If someone went on a trip and it was paid for by someone that shouldn`t have paid for it or if they sponsored an earmark for a company that benefitted one of their donors, that`s what happened.
And the objection that anybody should know about that is really a different animal from members are being slammed.
TODD: Is there any part of the due process argument that you think is a fair critique?
WISE: I never saw any part of that. I mean, this was a very member friendly process, starting with them being told what was being investigated all the way through to having the last word in front of -- in front of our board.
TODD: It`s interesting you say member-driven. You`ve had plenty of experience. You prosecuted Enron. You`ve had plenty of experience going after -- in your opinion, you`re not there now, is the -- was the -- is this office too friendly to Congress? Even as it stands now?
WISE: You know, I think it works. It worked within the confines that were put on it. But it produced very intense, very vigorous fact-based investigations. And then, the chips fell where they -- where they fell after that was presented to the House, presented to the members and presented to the public.
TODD: All right. Leo Wise, you would like to see the office stay?
WISE: I think it -- I think it delivered a valuable service and if -- and it the House -- if the House wants that service, then that`s what -- that`s what they were getting.
TODD: All right. Leo Wise, the man who ran this office when was first created in 2008. Thanks for coming in, sir.
WISE: My pleasure.
TODD: Appreciate it.
Before I bring in the panel, I want to play something that Republican Congressman Eric Cantor said when he was in House leadership. Cantor was in Congress in 2006 when Republicans lost control of the House. They lost control amid of a wave of ethics investigations.
This is an interview that Cantor did with ""The National Review"" in 2010 as Republicans were campaigning to take back control of Congress.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
ERIC CANTOR (R), FORMER U.S. HOUSE MAJORITY LEADER: I think it`s for Republicans who emerge as a new governing majority, it`s incumbent upon us to execute a zero on zero tolerance policy that, you know, we understand there are reasons for our being fired in 2006 and 2008.
Some of that had to do with ethics` violations. I mean, we had several members under public investigation during the time of the 2006 elections.
I think we`ve learned that that`s not a good way to gain the confidence of the people and that we ought to be instituting a zero-tolerance policy here.
It`s time for us to live up to the people`s expectations and that is we cannot tolerate any ethics` violations or behavior, in terms of compromising the ethics that the people expect us to have as their representatives.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
TODD: So, let`s bring in the panel. Cornell Belcher is a Democratic pollster. Ramesh Ponnuru, Senior Editor at said National Review. May have been part of that interview, actually, way back when. And Susan Page, Washington Bureau Chief at ""USA Today.""
You know, Ramesh, I will start with you since it`s your publication that did that interview. That -- and it strikes me today that some of these Republicans that are in the House apparently forgot why they lost it before.
Because that`s what made this, to me, so head scratching in the -- in the first place. And it`s like, where was Eric Cantor sentiment yesterday when this was happening?
RAMESH PONNURU, SENIOR EDITOR, NATIONAL REVIEW INSTITUTE: Well, there`s been a lot of turnover among House Republicans.
TODD: Including Eric Cantor.
PONNURU: Including Eric Cantor, that`s right. And it would be interesting to see a breakdown between the older members and the newer members --
TODD: Yes.
PONNURU: -- on this vote. But I think there`s no question that this was politically a colossal blunder. Just a terrible way to start off the new year. And if Trump hadn`t intervened --
TODD: Oh.
PONNURU: -- one wonders whether they would have had the sense to pull back.
TODD: Now, Trump didn`t say he was for this office. He just said, what are you prioritizing here? But it was -- it was actually a more effective shaming, I think.
CORNELL BELCHER, DEMOCRATIC POLLSTER: Politically and I`m glad you showed that because I remember. I was in the meetings that -- when -- in going into 2006 election where we -- where we rolled out, you might remember this, Chuck, a culture of corruption.
TODD: Yes. It was the 2006 campaign.
BELCHER: It was. And, by the way, there a lot of fighting to have Democrats land on that. And we finally landed on that and what we did, over time, was under -- Republican`s had two big advantages. They were over security as well as values, right. And over the culture of corruption, we undermined that big gap they had in middle America around values and doing the right thing.
And this sort of spoke to -- spoke to me exactly the same problem as this fundamental overstaff, that if Republicans aren`t seen as a value, sort of center party, and middle America and church-going America, it`s a real problem for them. This was a colossal mistake.
TODD: And Susan, what`s interesting here, and this is where Trump -- I`m going to quote Chris Matthews. He likes to say this. He`s got the best ear in politics. He`s not stupid. He knew -- he knew where this was headed and he almost -- he basically -- you could argue it probably gets repealed anyway that they were getting a lot of grief.
SUSAN PAGE, WASHINGTON BUREAU CHIEF, ""USA TODAY"": At some point, yes.
TODD: Perhaps, at some point. And he decided, I know how to -- I know how to make it happen today.
PAGE: That`s right. Or at least I know how to appear to make it happen --
TODD: That`s right. That`s right.
PAGE: -- because of me. Because you know --
TODD: A good deal.
PAGE: -- members of Congress were also getting a lot of calls from constituents saying, what in the world are you doing? It`s not just a political mistake. It goes to why do they think they were sent here?
TODD: And that goes to my question, what was the message for the voters? Right?
PAGE: That`s right. That`s right. So, in secret, on an issue that no one ever talked about during this entire campaign, --
TODD: Right.
PAGE: -- they choose to do that first.
PONNURU: You know, the other thing is -- and I`m not one who is quick to praise President-elect Trump. But it was also deft because the careful, gentle way in which he did it. He didn`t say, you guys are being corrupt - -
TODD: That`s right.
PONNURU: -- or being crooked. He said, basically, stop and take a second. Is this really the way you want to start things off?
PAGE: And, you know, two things. One was --
TODD: It was a mature -- it was, actually, a very mature way of handling it.
PAGE: Smart. It was subtle.
TODD: Very subtle.
PAGE: Not usually the adjective we use with Donald Trump`s tweets. You know, not only were they willing to listen to him, he was willing to give them a hard time in a public way. He didn`t, like, call the leader and say, quietly, please, you`ve got to get out of this. This is a bad idea. He did it in public.
And that tells you something about how this is, like -- this count is likely to operate for the next two years with this Republican (INAUDIBLE.)
TODD: This was a new sheriff in town. It`s a small moment but it`s a new sheriff in town moment.
BELCHER: But it showed us also who -- and, again, I`m not meaning to be partisan here. But that`s who Congress is. Look, eight percent of Americans think that members of Congress are highly ethical, according to Gallup poll.
TODD: Yes. There is bipartisan -- there is bipartisan agreement on one thing. They`re always getting corrupt.
BELCHER: All these guys are corrupt. And you feed into that (INAUDIBLE) when the first thing you do is scratch this office.
TODD: And let me paint another scenario. Donald Trump`s got his own conflicts of interest issues that people -- that Democrats certainly believe is going to trip him up, at some point.
The question`s always been, how are House Republicans going handle those issues when they have to do this? Congress, we`ve heard from a lot of Congressional Republicans who say they`re going to hold him accountable personally on this stuff.
Hasn`t that undermined that effort in time with their mess today?
PAGE: Is it ironic? I mean, is it possible Congressional Republicans thought they could do this because of Donald Trump? Because Donald Trump - -
TODD: That`s what I`m wondering.
PAGE: -- has not released his taxes. He`s not going to --
(CROSSTALK)
The public doesn`t care so we might as well do it as well.
TODD: And that`s -- I guess they got a message today that, well, the public actually still cares.
PONNURU: I do think that these things, they matter if they`re added to other things. If there`s a perception that the Republicans are more interested in their own personal advancement, than they`re in doing anything good for (INAUDIBLE.)
TODD: And that`s what today looked like.
PONNURU: And that`s what happened in 2005 and 2006 also.
BELCHER: And that`s what Democrats have to take advantage of. I mean, this whole idea that they`re corrupt and they`re for special interests. If Democrats can roll that into the next midterm election, I think they`ll be successful.
TODD: Well, day one.
BELCHER: Day one, I`m already starting.
TODD: There it is. All right, stick around.
Coming up, the big challenges facing both parties in the new year. What will Republicans really do about health care, in between repealing it and repealing it again? Will Democrats try to stop president Trump the way Republicans tried to stop President Obama or finds way to work with him?
Stay tuned.
TODD: Welcome back.
No drama this year. Paul Ryan was easily elected to his first full-time as House speaker this afternoon. Ryan captured 239 of 240 votes cast by Republicans. Remember, he doesn`t vote for himself.
The lone Republican defection, Kentucky`s Thomas Massie. He voted for Daniel Webster. The current Congressman from Florida`s tenth district, not the 19th century senator. Massie has never voted for the establishment Republican pick in any speaker election so that wasn`t exactly news.
Let`s look at the full tally here, a little more dissent on the Democratic side believe it or not.
Ohio`s Tim Ryan received two votes. Remember, he challenged Nancy Pelosi for the Democratic leader spot.
Congressman John Lewis and Jim Cooper also received a vote of peace for this second consecutive speaker election.
A lot fewer defections this year on the Republican side compared to two speaker elections in 2015. And with four descending votes this year, defection is slowly growing in the Democratic caucus.
We`ll be back with more MTP DAILY in 60 seconds.
TODD: Welcome back.
As you know, it`s like the first day of school here in Washington. So, for the first time since 2007, Republicans control both Congressional chambers and the White House. It`s actually just the 10th congressional term in the last 100 years with Republicans running the entire show.
With a new Congress today and a new administration taking office in a couple of weeks, very quickly, here`s a quick overview of the big storylines that we are watching as we kick off 2017.
First, change or experience. What will define the Trump administration?
Next up, health care. Are Republicans prepared to own the repeal? Supreme Court. Who will be Trump`s pick and what type of fight will really follow? How ideological will it get? And what will the Democratic strategy be? Will they change a little or a lot?
Opposition tactics. Will Democrats borrow from the GOP playbook to counter Trump or do they feel they can do it piecemeal?
What about the economy? Will it keep humming along and how much credit will Trump try to take if it does?
And finally, Trump and Russia. Will the new administration`s ties and stance on Russia become a liability or is Trump right that the public doesn`t care as much as Washington?
Let`s bring back the panel, Cornell, Ramesh, Susan. Susan, I`ll start with you. Of those storylines that we are outlining, what to you is the biggest question you want to get answered to understand this year better?
PAGE: You know, I think Russia is the surprise there, because all the others were things you could`ve said on election night. But the fact that Russia looms as big problem for Donald Trump. That he is at odds, not just with Democrats and not just with the intelligence community, but with congressional Republicans, like John McCain and others, on this issue.
It strikes me that this is something he`s going to need to address in a way that he hasn`t. And I guess he feels the same way because he`s meeting with intelligence agency leaders, of some sort, he says, this week to get more information about it.
TODD: Well, and it`s more than just the intelligence investigation and all the hacking issue. It`s also -- if he`s going to have a policy closer to Russia, Ramesh, it also means he`s making a decision to pick Russia over China. And China is going to feel that.
I mean, you know, when you play world chess, you`re playing -- you`re really playing the game of risk.
PONNURU: Yes, it reverberates all through the world with respect to our Middle Eastern policies as well.
And one of the other question that we`re going to have -- we`re going to watch unfold is, what kind of Republican resistance there is there?
TODD: And who leads it besides McCain and Graham? They`re sort of, to me, the usual suspects.
PONNURU: Well, and then --
PAGE: Ryan maybe.
PONNURU: And what happens with Senator Rubio on this issue?
PAGE: Yes, that`s a good point.
PONNURU: He did initially say about the Tillerson pick that he was going to have questions on it.
TODD: Well, he had a great tweet, right. I think it was friend of Vladimir was not among, I think, the qualifies he was looking for in the next secretary of state.
Cornell, let me ask you a bit of -- I`m going to put you a little bit on the spot on the Democratic side which is this.
BELCHER: Oh.
TODD: You got your shots in the last time, right? It seems as if this fight between Keith Ellison and Tom Perez is a proxy fight. It could be turning into a proxy fight for the following. The Democrats that think there needs to be a wholesale change inside the party, Keith Ellison.
And the Democrats that think, hey, Hillary Clinton was an awful candidate. But she still got three million more votes anyway. We don`t need to change much next election. We`re going to win. And that`s the Tom Perez camp.
Too simplistic or does that sound about right?
BELCHER: I think there`s a nuance there. I think there really is some nuance there. And part of the argument going on in the Democratic Party right now was, so which direction do they go? Do -- in fact, some people say, we`ve got to go more after some of these blue-collar voters than went for Trump.
Some of them say, you know what? Barack Obama won back to back majorities, 51 percent, while winning House and Senate seats. But while losing those same blue collar -- those same blue collar voters, do you try to expand the electorate? And with younger voters and take -- and taking that diversity into account.
But what all of them are saying, which is interesting to me, is that we actually do need to rebuild the party. I mean, how realistic is 50-state (ph) strategy is ideal in investing in the party is on both sides of that (INAUDIBLE.)
TODD: But that`s structural. And that`s something that`s going to resonate with either one of them. But I think the -- and I guess I`m going to --
BELCHER: So, you`re -- I didn`t answer the question.
TODD: You didn`t answer the question. Because -- and I guess this is the question that Schumer has to answer. Is it Schumer`s job to decide, are they full-fledged opposition? Or do they think there`s -- what say you, Susan?
PAGE: Schumer is the only guy who has a tool to use for the next two years, right?
TODD: Right.
PAGE: So -- and Schumer`s speech today on the floor was interesting but not determinative. I don`t -- I think you could read it any way you wanted.
TODD: And it`s classic Schumer, actually. He`s very good about that.
PAGE: Right. There were quotes to fulfill any kind of analysis you want.
TODD: Bernie sanders, happy. Joe Manchin, happy. Schumer knows how to give a speech to do both.
PAGE: When you look at the future of the Democrats, it`s -- one thing that`s interesting to me is that Barack and Michelle Obama have a say. I`m not sure Bill and Hillary Clinton do. I`m not sure Bill and Hillary are going to very much influence. The first time in a quarter century that they haven`t been the family with the most to say.
BELCHER: Right? And people are stepping up and saying, you know, and Barack`s going to do his farewell -- big farewell address in Chicago coming up.
TODD: And, by the way, I -- we have it -- I have to say, I have never seen so much fanfare.
BELCHER: Right.
TODD: Around this. Good idea or bad idea? It feels like a party-building exercise, Cornell.
BELCHER: Exactly. Well, clearly, someone who`s not -- you`re going to see step completely off the stage and say that you`ve seen other people step completely off the stage. And his -- and his library (ph) is going to be sort of aggressive in trying to do things in the community as well.
So, I think -- I think we`re still going to be under the influence of Barack Obama and Michelle Obama for some time.
TODD: This isn`t the Oval Office farewell address as well, you two. Although, you know, I was just waiting (ph) to say --
PONNURU: It`s a new political era, Chuck.
TODD: No, no, no, no. And it -- but I think it does --
PONNURU: (INAUDIBLE) snarkily (ph).
TODD: -- but it does set up Barack Obama the anti -- the face of the Democratic opposition?
PONNURU: You know, that`s an interesting question. One thing that I don`t see among the Democrats. I see some Democrats who are talking about how the party needs to appeal more to white working class voters, on the basis of economics.
What I don`t see is them saying what other Democrats have done in the past which is we also need to try to cater a little bit to their cultural sensibilities, in a way that Bill Clinton did in the 1990s.
And I wonder if a merely economic message is going to be enough to try to cut those margins.
BELCHER: No. No, they`re absolutely not. I wrote a whole book about it. No. I mean, there are -- there are a cultural -- (INAUDIBLE) White House.
There are -- there is a cultural riff right now going on in this country and progressives. And particularly some of my liberal friends, they think everything`s transactional.
And you know what? To that middle America family and middle American that goes to church every Sunday, everything isn`t about their pocketbook transaction to them. There`s -- Howard Dean used to talk about it. They`re not voting for this for economic interest. They`re voting for higher interests. I don`t think enough of our progressives understand that.
PAGE: You know, I would disagree with one thing you`ve said though. I don`t think Barack Obama will become the face of the Democratic opposition.
TODD: No.
PAGE: And if he did, that would be at odds with a century of precedent for presidents leaving office. That doesn`t mean he can`t weigh in on issues that he cares a lot about. But --
TODD: (INAUDIBLE) a century because Teddy Roosevelt.
PAGE: . he said - not since Teddy Roosevelt.
(LAUGHTER)
TODD: But we`re arguing not been in a tumultuous political period in American Politics who oddly enough in this case since then we have two parties so .
(CROSSTALK)
PAGE: Why do Americans have so much more respect for Jimmy Carter than they had when he left over (ph) for George W. Bush .
TODD: Yes.
PAGE: . or George H. W. Bush and it`s because they took a different path.
TODD: All right, guys. We`re pausing here.
Still ahead, as the Twitter and chief picks his latest corporate target, is he helping to keep jobs in the U.S. or are we looking at crony capitalism? Stay tuned.
TODD: Welcome back to more presidents of the President`s Club have now RSVP`d for the upcoming inauguration. We learned today that both President Clinton and former Secretary State Hillary Clinton will attend Trump`s inauguration, and we know that President George Bush and former First Lady Laura Bush will be there as well. President Carter said in late December he plans to attend the inauguration.
George H.W. Bush and his wife, Barbara, who are 92 and 91 years old respectively, will not be attending traditionally, all former presidents, if they can, physically, attend the inaugural, and they`re all always invited. All of the living presidents attended President Obama`s first inauguration in 2009. We remember this famous photo, the last there and then the last time all five of the current members of the President`s Club were together was at the dedication of the George W. Bush Presidential Library in 2013.
More MTP Daily ahead, including tweeting Trump and corporate America, but first, here`s Deirdre Bosa take at (ph) corporate America with the CNBC Market Wrap.
DEIRDRE BOSA, TECHNOLOGY REPORTER, CNBC: That`s right. Thanks, Chuck. Well. markets started the New Year with gains. The Dow -- the Dow -- excuse me, rising 119 points, the S&P adding 19 and the NASDAQ higher by 46 points. American factory activity hit a two-year high in December, thanks to a surge of new orders. It could be a sign of a rebound from the effects of a strong dollar overseas and lower demand for oil drilling equipment.
And more than a quarter of consumers say, they plan to try mobile payments for purchases this year according to a study by Visa. That amount to an increase of about 8 percent over 2016. That`s it from CNBC, first in business, worldwide.
TODD: Welcome back to MTP Daily. First, to Carrier, then Boeing and Lockheed Martin now, General Motors each in the crosshairs of tweets from President-Elect Donald Trump. This morning Trump tweeted the following, ""General Motors is sending Mexican made model of Chevy Cruze to U.S. car dealers tax free across border. Made in USA or paid big border tax.""
Now, GM explained later that only a small number of Chevy Cruzes are built in Mexico, and all of the Sedans are actually built in Ohio, but the hatchback which accounts for only 2.4 percent of the models sold in the United States in the last year are indeed made in Mexico. Before the market is open, GM shares initially fell, but did end up the day -- higher for day.
And on the same day, by the way, the Trump took after GM, he`s been heaping praise on GM`s chief competitor, Ford. Ford announced today that its scrapping plans to build a plant in Mexico, remember Trump hinted at this a few weeks ago. Instead, Ford said it is investing $700 million in the State of Michigan.
The company`s president and CEO said it was encouraged to do so because of Trump`s pro growth policies. And of course, Trump immediately took credit for that on Twitter. Let`s not forget, a few days after the election, Trump tweeted about speaking to his friend and Ford`s chairman, Bill Ford, about keeping one of the companies plants in Kentucky.
Folks, keeping jobs in the U.S. is a good thing, but this could begin to some to smell like crony capitalism, saying they -- Ford makes this big announcement, it goes after GM, ouch, those who are friendly to Trump are profiting while other American companies get vilified and could risk watching their stock value plummet as a result before things open at 9:00 a.m.
So, what if you`re one of these companies, what do you do? Well, joining me now is the man many companies turn to, to get the answer to that question, Eric Dezenhall. He is a crisis management consultant. He`s also author of the book, ""Glass Jaw: A Manifesto for Defending Fragile Reputations in the Age of Instant Scandal."" Mr. Dezenhall, wow. So .
ERIC DEZENHALL, AUTHOR: What are your options?
TODD: What are your options. You wake up. You`re married Dara (ph), this morning, and you think, first day at work, holiday, you came back and went, oh good grief. President-elect is after us. What do you .
(CROSSTALK)
DEZENHALL: Company is -- company is under attack by Trump on Twitter have three options. Number one, you can capitulate; number two, you can minimize; three, you can fight back. Let`s look at them one at a time.
TODD: Yes.
DEZENHALL: If you want to capitulate, that`s a great example of what essentially happened today. What basically .
(CROSSTALK)
TODD: What Carrier did?
DEZENHALL: . well, yes, but -- but take a look at what Ford did, it`s interesting, because what they essentially did by capitulating, not because they were tweeted against, but they preempted. They gave Trump a win. And that`s what I mean by capitulation.
TODD: Yes.
DEZENHALL: You, sir, in your brilliance, wisdom, and handsomeness were right. We are going to do what we want you to do, problem solved, you`re out of the news. And that`s what companies really want. So, that is always your first choice. Second, you have the issue of minimization. If you look at what Trump did a few weeks ago, he went after the pharmaceutical companies for pricing.
TODD: Yes.
DEZENHALL: Well, they can`t capitulate. How do hundreds of drug companies come together inside of three minutes and read pricing .
TODD: Right.
DEZENHALL: . policy on thousands of different drugs. You can`t. So, what did they do? Vanilla (ph) sort of statement that we look forward to constructive dialogue with the administration. The thing about Twitter, the bad news is Trump tweets. The good news is he tweets about a lot of stuff.
TODD: Yes.
DEZENHALL: And you never know when your issue is going to move out of the news. And the good news for the drug companies is, that issue did move out of the news, temporarily. It will be back, but sometimes the better of your bad options is to be boring.
TODD: And it -- to be boring or do you just stick your head in the sand and just hope it goes away?
DEZENHALL: But that`s - but that`s what I mean .
TODD: Yes.
DEZENHALL: . but get off and does (ph). One area where the crisis management industry is 30 years behind is they keep telling their clients, ""You must respond immediately."" No.
TODD: Sometimes the best response is just saying nothing, right?
DEZENHALL: Well, sometimes the problem goes away quickly. I mean, the bad news about Twitter is it`s out there. The good news is there`s millions and billions of tweets.
TODD: Yes.
DEZENHALL: The third issue -- the third option is when things get interesting. Fighting back.
TODD: Yes.
DEZENHALL: And this is what companies are terrified of because what companies don`t do .
TODD: They don`t know how to do it.
DEZENHALL: Well, what they -- what they`re good at is behind the scenes work.
TODD: Yes.
DEZENHALL: What they don`t do is they don`t -- they don`t want to get on TV with you and defend their companies. Why? Because number one, it`s not what they do. I`m telling you that there are companies with 20,000 employees that don`t have one person who is trained, willing, and able to get on TV, why? And not because they`re stupid, but as a general rule, whoever goes on TV and defends .
TODD: Yes.
DEZENHALL: . the company, probably loses their job. And so, what -- the big unknown .
TODD: Yes.
DEZENHALL: . right now in corporate America and where there is a lot of teeth gnashing right now is what if Trump does something that is so permanently onerous to our business that we must go on TV and Twitter .
TODD: Fight.
DEZENHALL: . and fight.
TODD: You`re going lose that fight. More times than not.
DEZENHALL: You`re probably -- you`re probably going to, but what if you have no other choice? And what companies are now trying to figure out, under what conditions will we fight back? Who goes on? What they`re probably going to decide is number two, minimization and take their hit because nobody really wants to fight of the president of the United States.
TODD: So, the goal is going to be a lot of companies are going to do -- to go back to your one, two, three, number -- preemptive strike. Ford knew it could be in the crosshairs in the campaign. Find a way to give him a win.
DEZENHALL: Right. That is your best choice, but the second option is what`s more likely is minimization.
TODD: Right. Let me ask you for the last question, is this a boom for your business, crisis management? Knowing that a president-elect is willing, at any moment in time, to upend the apple (ph) cart of corporate America or because Trump is so personal about it? Does it actually make CEOs think they have to do this themselves?
DEZENHALL: I think that everybody is terrified and when they`re terrified, yes they call and ask, but it doesn`t mean they`re going to take my advise because what companies usually decide to do is hide.
TODD: Well, there you go. Eric Dezenhall, thanks for not hiding. Always fun. Appreciate it.
DEZENHALL: You bet.
TODD: Is the country too obsessed with scandals? I`ll explain. Plus, dueling messages President Obama and President-Elect Mike Pence ended the Hill (ph) to rally their parties on ObamaCare. That`s ahead on the Lid. Stay tuned.
TODD: Tonight, I`m obsessed with what the dictionary defines as in action or event regarded as morally or legally wrong and causing general public outrage. We used to have a word for those in American politics, scandals and at my best, kids get off my lone voice. I tell you that back in my day, there were real scandals. Watergate, that`s a scandal, Teapot Dome, Iran- Contra, Lewinsky Affair. Those were scandals.
Now, it feels like people have gotten so numb to the word because it`s now use by both sides to describe pretty much everything they don`t like about the other side. Just look around. Conservative (ph) my point to this break part (ph) article which lists 18 major scandals under President Obama, but folks, they include stuff like the 2013 government shutdown in ObamaCare which are not scandals. Those are political disagreements.
On the left, Democrats might point to this piece in the Atlantic which lists 19 scandals involving Donald Trump. They include Trump four bankruptcies and his hiring campaign manager of Corey Lewandowski. Again, not scandals at all. Both legally -- the legal things they could do. We`re not at the point where every eyebrow raising thing gets a gate tacked on to it as if two brand it -- like a piece of USDA the certified scandal.
We even do it with the pressure readings on a football deflategate (ph) anyone which raises a bigger problem. What is a scandal anymore, especially in this ultra-partisan environment? Russian hacking, using a private e-mail server, presidential conflicts of interest, here`s a real problem, if everything is a scandal, then nothing is a scandal. Not everything has to go to 11.
We`ll be back.
TODD: Time for the Lid. Republicans have started the ball rolling, again, on the effort to repeal ObamaCare. This time they have the vote on the president just signing the bill, but the bill that such repeal in motion was introduce today and the debate is expected to begin on the set up floor tomorrow. But what are they repealing and when are they going to repeal it?
But anyway, tomorrow, both President Obama and Vice President-Elect Mike Pence will on Capitol Hill to huddle with their respective caucuses about the next steps when it comes to president health care law. Democrats, of course, are strategizing ways to save it. Republicans trying to figure out how they legislatively kill it but as for whether there will be a replacement option in place, if and when Republicans repeal the law, listen to what Trump advisor, Kellyanne Conway said this morning.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
KELLYANNE CONWAY, PRESIDENTIAL ADVISOR AND STRATEGIST: Some experts say that it could take years to actually complete the process.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Right now, do you or do you not have a replacement plan ready to go ramp up -- ready to go say tomorrow?
CONWAY: We have pieces of it that we need to discuss, but we don`t have an HHS secretary confirmed yet.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
TODD: Panelist are back. Cornell, Ramesh, Susan. Well, Cornell, President Obama`s job tomorrow is to figure out new roadblock that the Democrats can put in to save his health care?
BELCHER: Well, I`m laughing because, you know, they don`t have any pieces that particularly about how to replace it because, you know, what ObamaCare is? It was a Republican idea, Chuck, and it was Republican idea, put in place by a Republican governor in Massachusetts, right, because a lot of the Liberals and progresses in the House quite frankly, wanted something a little more progressive, wanted a single payer .
TODD: Yes.
BELCHER: So, this was actually a Republican idea that President Obama tried. But politically, here is the problem, we almost run a table. It is really hard to repeal some that we have 20 some million people using, right?
TODD: Yes.
BELCHER: And not just on blue states but in -- go to -- go to Mitch McConnell`s state. You know, where ObamaCare is going to be really successful?
TODD: Yes.
BELCHER: In Mitch McConnell state.
TODD: My favorite anecdote like (ph) President Obama used to go into like the communications office in 2014. He said, ""Kentucky, Kentucky.""
(LAUGHTER)
He had another word a pan (ph) to the skin -- there was another word that he used to elaborate the word Kentucky.
BELCHER: Right. And this sort of takeaway and I know the Republicans wanted to take away so the whole idea of the mandate, but if you take away the mandate, and look, we know -- because they include (ph) the mandate it all collapses because young people won`t do it, right? So, this is I think they got themselves in quite a box here with having to try to repeal this but quite frankly is really tough to find a replacement.
TODD: Ramesh, rhetorically, they have no choice but to vote on this repeal. But at this point, why not -- is it -- is it in their interest to pretend they are repealing and saying it`s a three-way or do they own up to the fact that look, we`re not repealing the whole thing, we`re getting rid a lot of it. We promise but we know we can`t rid of all of it. Why don`t they just say that?
PONNURU: I think that they ought to say it. I think that the fact is the regulatory heart of the ObamaCare is something that they don`t think -- seem to think they can get to with a simple majority with the Senate. They think they need 60 votes to get their middle (ph) half 60 votes. So, what they`re going to do is try to repeal the parts that they can repeal with the civil majority, but they haven`t figured out a way that will make that work.
Speaker Ryan in his press releases in ObamaCare keep saying, he wants a quote, ""stable transition to new system."" What they are talking about will not provided that stable transition.
PAGE: You know, their problem is they can repeal and delay, that`s OK. That will get them past and I think they have to vote to repeal it -- to just so that they can say they repeal because that`s been a Republican mantra for so long but the trouble is in four years. They`ve got to have Trump care in operation, right?
TODD: I .
PAGE: And how -- and they -- I`m a bit surprised that they`ve -- that they`ve now committed to the preexisting conditions provision which is very difficult to manage as you -- as you were -- as you were noting that today Kellyanne Conway said they weren`t going to -- people are going to lose their health care insurance if they gain it (ph) to ObamaCare. That`s a very hard thing .
(CROSSTALK)
BELCHER: I know -- I remember that promise.
TODD: I remember that .
(CROSSTALK)
BELCHER: . a democratic bridge (ph).
(CROSSTALK)
PAGE: You complete the doctrine (ph).
(CROSSTALK)
TODD: You like and play. They can keep an eye. Good luck with that.
(LAUGHTER)
PONNURU: A year of disruption of your health care arrangement has been the dominating political fact of health care, all the way through here .
TODD: Right.
PONNURU: . and that`s the problem they`ve got
TODD: How many of you think this will be the following reality over the next decade on ObamaCare which is it becomes the new doc fix or the new -- the new tax fix where every Congress right at the end, they have to pass the law that they such - we repeal it, but we`re continuing -- if there`s a continuation of it for another two years.
BELCHER: I think absolutely, and by the way, this is why Americans don`t like politics and this is why their politics is broken because that`s not real because they -- that`s exactly what`s going to happen.
TODD: You know, the headline will be repeal Ramesh, but they have to keep punting and keep punting and keep punting, and in 2022, they punt (ph) again.
PONNURU: The problem with that scenario though is that ObamaCare needs continuing patching up. You can`t just extend it or changes are all ready in trouble. Obama was calling for legislative fixes. It`s hard to see this Congress and this president actually doing that.
TODD: Well, maybe he takes apparently the advice of President Obama also apparently is ready to give Donald Trump push (ph) -- just slap on your name, call it Trump care and then .
(LAUGHTER)
. agenda through. Cornell, Ramesh, Susan, thank you. After the break, the Joe Show, the best of Vice Presidents Biden`s from today`s Senate photo opt. Stay tuned.
TODD: In case you missed it. This afternoon for the final time, the vice president welcome the new Senate class. Remember, the vice president, he is still vice president until January 20th and he`s still president of the Senate and a new Senate is coming. Well, here`s all the Joe Biden welcoming them.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
JOE BIDEN, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Thanks, guys. Well, hi. Hello.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: See what?
(LAUGHTER)
BIDEN: You sound like my daughter, Susan (ph).
(LAUGHTER)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Vice president, I do. Congratulations. I know that they`ve gone through (ph).
BIDEN: To that.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I know.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Why don`t you kiss me?
(LAUGHTER)
BIDEN: Please sit down. Mom, I what to know what you`re drinking. God, you look like little sister.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And doing it (ph).
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Would you blow the vice president with kiss?
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: She blew you a kiss? Oh.
(LAUGHTER)
BIDEN: Over there and may love it (ph).
(CROSSTALK)
(END VIDEO CLIP)
TODD: Man, the baby avoided him, ouch. But come on we`re all going to miss the bipartisan effort and resolution in the United States Senate, Joe Biden should be the greeter for all in these Senators all the time regardless of whether he`s still vice president.
That`s all for tonight.
THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED."
0	61	 62 von 72	Fox News Network	January 2, 2017 Monday	 FOX HANNITY	 10:00 PM EST		"SEAN HANNITY, HOST: And welcome to this special edition of ""Hannity."" So during the 2016 campaign, President-elect Donald Trump -- he criss-crossed the country explaining to you, the American people, the voters what he would do if elected. Tonight for the full hour, we'll examine some of Donald Trump's promises like these.
Let's take a look.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: We will build a great wall and stop the drugs from pouring into our country and poisoning our youth.
Every day, the law known as ""Obama care"" is destabilizing our health care. That is why we'll repeal and replace ""Obama care."" We have no choice.
It's time to shake the rust off America's foreign policy. It's time to invite new voices and new visions into the fold.
We will reestablish the rule of law and appoint justices to the Supreme Court of the United States who will uphold and defend our Constitution.
We're going to drain the swamp of corruption in Washington, D.C.
We are going to make America great again, greater than ever before!
(END VIDEO CLIP)
HANNITY: Now, let's start with one of the major topics that got Americans fired up on the campaign trail, immigration. President-elect Trump -- he promised he'd build a wall, deport criminal illegal immigrants and more. Take a look.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
HANNITY: Let's start with, I guess, your signature issue on immigration, which is you're going to build the wall.
TRUMP: Yes, 100 percent.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
HANNITY: Who's going to pay for the wall?
AUDIENCE: Mexico!
HANNITY: All right. All right.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
TRUMP: Well, you know...
HANNITY: Here's my question...
TRUMP: ... what has been interesting that I've been watching over the last week or two, and they've been saying, Oh, well, maybe he won't build the wall, maybe he won't...
HANNITY: Jeb Bush said that. Jeb Bush said, he'll never build the wall.
TRUMP: Oh, he said that a long time ago. I think...
(BOOS)
TRUMP: I think people now realize we're building the wall, it's going to happen, it's 100 percent simple. You know, I tell the story all the time, the Great Wall of China, 13,000 miles long. This is 1,000 miles and we have Caterpillar tractors to build, OK?
This is 1,000 miles -- it's 2,000, but we need 1,000. And it's so easy to do. And it gets higher and higher and higher every time somebody says I'm not going to build it.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
HANNITY: Here's an important question. I think the time for -- if you get elected president of the United States of America, how...
AUDIENCE: When! When!
HANNITY: According to the crowd, when...
TRUMP: When, yes.
HANNITY: Yes. But here's my question.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
HANNITY: How long -- how long would it take you to build that wall start to finish? You're a builder.
TRUMP: Yes, I'm very good at it. Almost immediately. Now, if you would believe it -- you know, they were going to build the wall a while ago, not so long ago, like in '06. And they couldn't get environmental impact statements, can you believe it? OK?
(BOOS)
TRUMP: Now, we got lucky because it is such -- it was such a little wall, it was such a nothing wall -- no, they couldn't get their environmental -- probably a snake was in the way or a toad or...
(LAUGHTER)
HANNITY: A turtle, could have been a turtle.
TRUMP: ... or something that you've probably never heard of.
HANNITY: Yes.
TRUMP: But something was in the way. And you think of China, in the South China Sea, they're building this massive fortress. They're building this massive military fortress. And they're digging that water, they're digging, digging.
And you know what happened? They said, Let's do it on Sunday, and on Monday morning, they started. So in our case, look, that wall is going to start very quickly. I got, as you know -- and we have a lot of the Border Patrol...
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
TRUMP: We have a lot of the Border Patrol agents here tonight. And we have 16,500 Border Patrol agents. They know the border better than anybody. Their job is much easier without Trump because all they have to do is let everyone just keep going by.
These are unbelievable people. They see what's happening. They see what's coming in. And they want it stopped. They want -- look, they want people to come in, but they want the people to be vetted.
So here's the story. So they endorsed me. First time in the history of the Border Patrol agents that they've endorsed (INAUDIBLE)
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
TRUMP: One other thing...
HANNITY: The Mexican president....
TRUMP: One other thing we have to say, and Mexico will pay for the wall. They're going to pay for the wall.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
HANNITY: Let me ask you this. Vicente Fox and the -- by the way, the current president of Mexico said he would meet with you. Will you meet with him?
TRUMP: Yes, sure. I'd meet with him.
HANNITY: You would?
TRUMP: Absolutely, I'd meet with him.
HANNITY: How do you -- they're not going to write you a check. How do you get them to pay for the wall?
TRUMP: Well, there are many ways. Look, look, on trade, they're absolutely killing us. They're killing us. They're killing us at the border. They're killing us on trade. We have a trade deficit with Mexico of close to $60 billion a year.
So right there, you can build a wall because the wall is a fraction of that. So you know, right there.
(APPLAUSE)
TRUMP: We are losing -- we lose a fortune on trade. And that doesn't include the drugs that are pouring across the border, which is probably double or triple or something, so...
HANNITY: I have covered the border now for years on this program. I've been from the Rio Grande to San Diego and everywhere in between 12 times.
TRUMP: Right.
HANNITY: I've been down to the -- I've seen drug warehouses. I have seen tunnels. We'll show some of the pictures.
My next question is -- and this is where you seem to in the last week be revisiting the issue of sending everybody back that is here illegally. Tell us where you stand on that.
TRUMP: We want to follow the laws. You know, we have very strong laws.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
TRUMP: We have very strong laws in this country. And I don't know if you know, but Bush and even Obama sends people back. Now, we can be more aggressive in that, but we want to follow the laws. If you start going around trying to make new laws in this country, it's a process that's brutal. We want to follow the laws of the country. And if we follow the laws, we can do what we have to do.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
(CROSSTALK)
TRUMP: Sean, let me tell you -- so important. We've got some great people in this country. They shouldn't be here. They're still great people, all right? But we've got some really, really bad gang members and some horrible people.
HANNITY: Start with them.
TRUMP: Those people are going out day one! They're going to be the first order I sign. They're going out day one!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
HANNITY: All right, but I know this question has come up a lot. What about people that work hard, have been here a long time, they own homes, they have their property. And this is a question everyone is going to want answered. What about them? Do they have to go back or would you reconsider that?
TRUMP: We are going to follow the laws of the country, Sean.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
HANNITY: That means they go back.
TRUMP: We are going to follow the laws. And we're going to see who people are. We're going to see how they've done. Do you believe in a merit system, Sean? When people come in, as an example, do you believe in a merit system?
HANNITY: Sure.
TRUMP: One of the things that's very unfair with leaving people is that you have years and years of people waiting on line. They've gone through a process, and they've -- they've filed...
HANNITY: Legally.
TRUMP: Legally. They've filed. And they're great people in some cases. I guess in some cases, maybe not. But you have really great people wanting and so proudly wanting to come into our country. And now what you'd be doing is you'd take people away from that line. And it's really sort of unfair.
HANNITY: Is there any part of the law that you might be able to change that would accommodate those people that contribute to society, have been law-abiding, have kids here? Would there be any room in your mind, or are you -- because I know you had a meeting this week.
TRUMP: I did.
HANNITY: With Hispanic leaders.
TRUMP: I did. I did. I had a meeting with great people, great Hispanic leaders. And there certainly can be a softening because we're not looking to hurt people. We want people -- we have some great people in this country. We have some great, great people in this country.
So but we're going to follow the laws of this country.
(CROSSTALK)
TRUMP: And you know, what people don't realize -- what people don't realize, we have very, very strong laws.
HANNITY: Yes, but Obama doesn't follow them.
TRUMP: Nobody understands that. No, they don't follow them.
HANNITY: Yes.
TRUMP: But we're going to follow the laws.
HANNITY: We have 11.3 million illegal immigrants in the country now. Now, you said immediately last night, all criminal aliens out, day one, correct?
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
TRUMP: (INAUDIBLE)
HANNITY: All right, now -- by the way...
TRUMP: That one's so simple. You know, there are some things where you sort of feel bad and you -- this one would be -- we have these killers in this country.
HANNITY: Right.
TRUMP: They're heading up gangs. You go out exactly...
HANNITY: They lost (INAUDIBLE) children right here behind you.
TRUMP: I mean, those guys, if we ever find them, if I'm president, oh!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
TRUMP: Trouble. Trouble. Such trouble.
To fix our immigration system, we must change our leadership in Washington, and we must change it quickly. Sadly, sadly, there is no other way. The truth is our immigration system is worse than anybody ever realized. But the facts aren't known because the media won't report on them. The politicians won't talk about them.
(BOOS)
TRUMP: And the special interests spend a lot of money trying to cover them up because they are making an absolute fortune. That's the way it is.
Today, on a very complicated and very difficult subject, you will get the truth. The fundamental problem with the immigration system in our country is that it serves the needs of wealthy donors, political activists and powerful, powerful politicians. It's all you can do. Thank you. Thank you.
Let me tell you who it does not serve. It does not serve you, the American people. Doesn't serve you. When politicians talk about immigration reform, they usually mean the following -- amnesty, open borders, lower wages.
(BOOS)
TRUMP: Immigration reform should mean something else entirely. It should mean improvements to our laws and policies to make life better for American citizens.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
TRUMP: We will terminate the Obama administration's deadly, and it is deadly, nonenforcement policies that allow thousands of criminal aliens to freely roam or streets, walk around, do whatever they do, crime all over the place. That's over. That's over, folks. That's over.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
TRUMP: Since 2013 alone, the Obama administration has allowed 300,000 criminal aliens to return back into United States communities. These are individuals encountered or identified by ICE but who were not detained or processed for deportation because it wouldn't have been politically correct.
(BOOS)
TRUMP: My plan also includes cooperating closely with local jurisdictions to remove criminal aliens immediately.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
TRUMP: We will restore the highly successful Secure Communities program. Good program. We will expand and revitalize the popular 287G partnerships which will help to identify hundreds of thousands of deportable aliens in local jails that we don't even know about.
Both of these programs have been recklessly gutted by this administration, and those were programs that worked. This is yet one more area where we are headed in a totally opposite direction. There's no common sense,, there's no brain power in our administration by our leader or our leaders. None. None. None.
On my first day in office I am also going to ask Congress to pass Kate's law, named for Kate Steinle...
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
TRUMP: ... to ensure that criminal aliens convicted of illegal reentry receive strong mandatory minimum sentences. Strong. And then we get them out.
Another reform I'm proposing is the passage of legislation named for Detective Michael Davis and Deputy Sheriff Danny Oliver, two law enforcement officers recently killed by a previously deported illegal immigrant. The Davis-Oliver bill will enhance cooperation with state and local authorities to ensure that criminal immigrants and terrorists are swiftly, really swiftly identified and removed. And they will go fast, believe me. They're going to go fast.
We are going to triple the number of ICE deportation offices. Within ICE, I am going to create a new special deportation task force focused on identifying and quickly removing the most dangerous criminal illegal immigrants in America who have evaded justice, just like Hillary Clinton has evaded justice, OK?
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
TRUMP: On immigration, that is my policy on immigration is so simple. We will restore the civil rights of African-Americans, Hispanic Americans and all Americans by ending illegal immigration. And yes, we will build a wall.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
TRUMP: We will build a wall. And we're going to stop the inflow, the massive inflow of drugs which coming into your community, more than any community, but coming into your community and poisoning our youth and poisoning many other people, but poisoning our youth.
I will reform visa rules to give American workers preference for jobs, and I will suspend reckless refugee admissions from terror-prone regions that cost taxpayers hundreds of billions of dollars.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
HANNITY: And coming up next on this special edition of ""Hannity""...
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
TRUMP: If we don't act, the damage will be irreversible. We're going to act. That is why we're going to repeal and replace ""Obama care."" We have no choice.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
TRUMP: We have no choice. We have absolutely no choice.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
HANNITY: Now, recently news broke that ""Obama care"" premiums will rise dramatically next year by double digits. Now, President-elect Trump promised Americans he will repeal and replace this dangerous law. That's coming up next as this special edition of ""Hannity"" continues.
(NEWSBREAK)
HANNITY: And welcome back to this special edition of ""Hannity,"" ""Trump's Promises.""
Now, during the campaign President-elect Trump -- he vowed that he would repeal and replace ""Obama care."" But how exactly will he get that done? Here's what he said.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
HANNITY: You made a promise to release the names so people would know your judicial philosophy.
TRUMP: Right.
HANNITY: You're making a promise to balance the budget. You're making a promise to build the wall. You made a promise you're going to repeal ""Obama care.""
TRUMP: 100 percent.
HANNITY: And replace it with?
TRUMP: There's no choice.
HANNITY: Replace it with?
TRUMP: By the way, you don't even have to repeal it. We're going to do it before it happens.
HANNITY: It's falling of its own weight.
TRUMP: In '17, it's going to implode! And in fact, on November 1st, new numbers are coming out right before the election. They're trying to change the date. They want to make it after the election. And it's going to show the increase necessary to sustain ""Obama care."" And it's going to be massive. Everyone's talking about it.
HANNITY: Are these promises...
TRUMP: Don't let anybody change that date.
HANNITY: And you want to replace it with health savings accounts maybe?
TRUMP: Yes, but there's so many other things. Just so you understand, once we get competition going, with free enterprise, where the insurance companies actually have to go and compete instead of having states as a monopoly -- you get rid of the borders. You get rid of the lines, right, where they can't go outside.
Once we get rid of that -- and they almost had it this time. They could have had it this time. And you would have seen such competition! There will be plans, health care plans, that you never even heard about that haven't been thought about right now. There will be such competition. It'll be a beautiful thing.
The numbers will go way down. First of all, ""Obama care"" is no good. The premiums are through the roof, but have you looked at deductibles lately?
HANNITY: It's huge, $5,000, $4,000...
TRUMP: Unless you're dead -- unless you're dad or in the process of almost death, you can't use them.
HANNITY: What I'm trying get to is with the release of these names -- that was a big promise. Balancing a budget is a big promise. Building a wall is a big promise. Repealing ""Obama care"" is a big promise. I understand you're giving a speech next week on energy independence.
TRUMP: Right.
HANNITY: That's a big promise.
TRUMP: In North Dakota.
HANNITY: Building our military, taking care of our vets -- those are big promises -- ending Common Core.
So my question is on those agenda items that you have told me about in our interviews, how rock solid are those promises for the people that may be on the fence that want to know you're going to do those things.
TRUMP: I want to get it all done.
HANNITY: You want to get it all done.
TRUMP: Look, our military -- I saw a show the other day where our fighter planes are so old that they go to junk yards to get parts -- they call them graveyards, airplane graveyards -- to take parts off old planes that haven't been flown in 25 years. They're taking parts off these planes and trying to put them on and fix them on our fighter jets! We are really in trouble!
HANNITY: Let's talk about ""Obama care."" You've talked about eliminating it, talked about portability, pre-existing conditions, and health care savings accounts. Do you believe health care savings accounts is the antidote?
TRUMP: Well, I think it's one of them. I think it's a great alternative. They work. They're fabulous. You can move. You can do whatever you want to do. Everybody wants them. You'll save money. You'll have much better plans. I mean, look at what's going on with ""Obama care."" The rates are going through the roof. Deductibles -- I mean, you won't even get to use it unless you have real big, long-lasting problem.
No, no. It's a -- it's a -- certainly one method. And there are many, by the way, Sean. You know, I know you always mention that, but there are many methods.
HANNITY: Yes.
TRUMP: But they'll all be better. And you don't have to be limited to one or two. We can use other methods. But people will be paying a lot less money. Sean, they'll be paying a lot less money for a lot better care.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
TRUMP: I will ask Congress to convene a special session so we can repeal and replace. And it will be such an honor for me, for you and for everybody in this country because ""Obama care"" has to be replaced. And we will do it and we will do it very very quickly. It is a catastrophe.
The president said if you like your plan, you can keep your plan. If you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor, which may go down as one of the great political lies of the century. Even the skeptical Democrats believed him and approved the legislation. There were Democrats that were very much against it, but they believed him and they approved it.
No one ever read, or certainly very few people, the 2,700-page bill. To this day, nobody understands it. The Obama administration has just announced massive double-digit and triple-digit ""Obama care"" premium hikes everywhere all throughout the country.
Here in Pennsylvania, premiums are going to increase more than 60 percent, and that's nothing compared to what will happen in the future. Of course, in the future, if I'm president, there won't be ""Obama care"" so you won't have to worry about it.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
TRUMP: That means parents won't have enough money to pay their bills or get medicine for their kids.
In the great state of Arizona, a wonderful place I just left, premiums will go up even higher than 116 percent. Other states are going up more than 60, 70, 80, 90 percent. Deductibles can go to $12,000, $13,000, $14,000, even $15,000. In other words, your health care won't even be usable. You're paying all of this money, you won't even get to use it.
People all across the country are devastated. In many instances, their health care costs are more than their mortgage costs or their rent, which by the way, is a first in American history.
This is particularly unfair to millennials and younger Americans generally who will be totally crushed by these massive health care costs before they even get started on their journey through life.
One third of the counties -- think of this. One third of the counties in Pennsylvania will have only a single insurance company left, if you have that. That includes Philadelphia, where I went to school. The Associated Press found that some of the 440,000 Pennsylvania consumers who buy insurance through Healthcare.gov will face some of the highest premium increases in the nation, people of Philadelphia. Insurers are leaving, premiums are soaring, doctors are quitting, companies are fleeing and deductibles go through the roof. Workers hours are being cut. Hiring is frozen, totally frozen, and wages are being slashed. ""Obama care"" means higher prices, fewer choices and lower quality.
Our replacement plan includes health savings accounts, a nationwide insurance market where you can purchase across state lines, and letting states manage Medicaid dollars -- so much better. We will create quality, reliable, affordable health care in a free market where parents can make the health care decisions that they really want to make for their families. It will be a much better health care at a much less expensive cost.
I've led a great life, and I truly love our country. So now I want to give back to the country that's been so good to me. That's why I'm doing this.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
TRUMP: All I see everywhere I travel in this nation -- and I've been everywhere -- is untapped potential waiting to be realized. The people are amazing. The people are amazing. If we unlock the potential of this country and its incredible people, no dream is outside of our reach.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
TRUMP: If we stop believing in our failed politicians and start believing in ourselves, then anything, anything is possible.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
TRUMP: I'm asking you to dream big, to push for bold change and to believe in a movement powered by our love for each other and our love for our country.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
TRUMP: That is how we will truly make America great again.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

HANNITY: And up next right here on this special edition of ""Hannity""...
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
TRUMP: My number one priority is to dismantle the disastrous deal with Iran. I know deal making, and let me tell you, this deal is catastrophic for America, for Israel and for the whole of the Middle East.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
HANNITY: Donald Trump -- he did not mince words on the campaign trail about some of President Obama's foreign policy failures. So what will Donald Trump do once he's inaugurated in January. That and more on this special edition of ""Hannity,"" ""Trump's promises,"" continues.
SEAN HANNITY, FOX NEWS HOST: Welcome back to HANNITY. So during the campaign president-elect Trump, he talked often about President Obama's foreign policy failures and what he would do differently if he was the commander in chief. Now here's what Trump promised you, the American voter, that he would do.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
DONALD TRUMP, (R) PRESIDENT-ELECT: I'd like to talk today about how to develop a new foreign policy direction for our country, one that replaces randomness with purpose, ideology with strategy, and chaos with peace. It's time the shake the rust off of America's foreign policy. It's time to invite new voices and new visions into the fold, something we have to do.
The direction I will outline today will also return us to a timeless principle. My foreign policy will always put the interests of the American people and American security above all. This has to be first, has to be. That will be the foundation of every single decision that I will make.
(APPLAUSE)
TRUMP: America first will be the major and overriding theme of my administration. But to chart our path forward we must first briefly take a look back.
We have a lot to be proud of. In the 1940s we saved the world. The greatest generation beat back the Nazis and Japanese imperialists. Then we saved the world again, this time from to totalitarianism and communism, the cold war, it lasted for decades, but guess what, we won, and we won big.
Democrats and Republicans working together got Mr. Gorbachev to heed the words of President Reagan, our great president, when he said ""tear down this wall.""
(APPLAUSE)
TRUMP: History will not forget what he said, very special, special man and president.
Unfortunately after the cold war our foreign policy veered badly off course. We failed to develop a new vision for a new time. In fact as time went on, our foreign policy began to make less and less sense. Logic was replaced with foolishness and arrogance, which led to one foreign policy disaster after another. They just kept coming and coming. We went from mistakes in Iraq to Egypt to Libya to President Obama's line in the sand in Syria. Each of these actions have helped to throw the region into chaos and gave ISIS the space it needs to grow and prosper. Very bad.
It all began with the dangerous idea that we could make western democracies out of countries that had no experience or interest in becoming a western democracy. We tore up what institutions they had and then were surprised at what we unleashed -- civil war, religion fanaticism, thousands of Americans just killed, lives, lives, lives wasted, horribly wasted. Many trillions of dollars were lost as a result. The vacuum was created that ISIS would fill. Iran, too, would rush in and fill the void, much to their really unjust enrichment. They have benefitted so much, so sadly for us.
Our foreign policy is a complete and total disaster. The situation is likely worse than the public has any idea. A new congressional report reveals that the administration has downplayed the growth of ISIS with 40 percent of analysts saying they have experienced efforts to manipulate their findings. They're trying to make it look much better than it is. It's bad.
At the same time, ISIS is trying to infiltrate refugee flows into Europe and to the United States. Iran, the world's largest state sponsor of terrorism, is now flush with $150 billion in cash released by the United States. Plus, if you remember from two weeks ago, another $400 million in actual cash that was obviously used for ransom. Worst of all, the nuclear deal puts Iran, the number one state sponsor of radical terrorists, on a path to nuclear weapons.
In short the Obama-Clinton foreign policy unleashed ISIS, destabilized the Middle East and put the nation of Iran, which chants ""Death to America,"" in a dominant position of regional power and in fact aspiring to be a dominant world power.
This is my pledge to the American people. As your president, I will be your single greatest champion.
(APPLAUSE)
TRUMP: I will fight to ensure that every American is treated equally, protected equally, and honored equally.
(APPLAUSE)
TRUMP: We will reject bigotry and hatred and oppression in all of its many ugly forms, and seek a new future built on our common culture and values as one American people. Only this way will we make America great again and safe again for everyone.
Thank you very much. God bless you. Thank you.
(APPLAUSE)

HANNITY: And up next right here on HANNITY --
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
TRUMP: And appoint justices of the United States Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the constitution of the United States.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
HANNITY: President-elect president Trump, he promised that he would appoint originalist justices to the Supreme Court. It was a topic we spoke about often. That's coming up next as this special edition of ""HANNITY, Trump's Promises,"" continues.
KELLY WRIGHT, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Live from America's news heard quarters. I'm Kelly Wright. Good evening. Here's what's happening. Blowing and drifting snow closing roads for a second straight day in North Dakota. Interstate 94 is closed across nearly the entire state. State highway officials warn dangerous driving conditions exist with near zero visibility on slippery roads. Icy road conditions also just in South Dakota. The storm also causing wide spread power outages in the Dakotas, Nebraska, and western Iowa.
A national day of mourning in Russia for the 92 victims onboard the military plane that crashed into the Black Sea Sunday. The victims included the entire Alexandrov Ensemble, a renowned Russian army choir. Flags are flying at half-staff throughout Moscow. Floral tributes are everywhere, like this one outside the choir's office and Russia's state capital. Meantime the search continues for more victims.
I'm Kelly Wright. Back to HANNITY.
HANNITY: Welcome back to this special edition of ""HANNITY, Trump's Promises."" During the campaign Donald Trump said he would appoint originalist justices to the Supreme Court, people like Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas who actually believe in the constitution, coequal branches of government, and separation of powers. Now, the president-elect even released a list of people that he would choose from. So here's what he said.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
HANNITY: It was a very big day. You have a list of names.
TRUMP: I do.
HANNITY: And you talked to me for a while now about releasing these names. Your judicial philosophy, you said you wanted originalists. You've said you wanted people like Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas on the Supreme Court. Tell us about this list of names.
TRUMP: I've been having a lot of feedback from a lot of different people, and I have had, as you know, tremendous endorsements, and I'm a conservative, and I may different views on different things, and I think I'm extremely conservative, as an example, on trade, but a conservative would say I'm not because I don't necessarily believe only in free trade. You know what I believe on trade is good deals for the United States.
HANNITY: Fair trade.
TRUMP: Somebody said to me what is your view on trade? I said, my view is good deals for the United States. It's a very simple view. And if you can call it conservative, call it whatever you want. But so with the judges, they were saying, well, what happens if he appoints the wrong judges? What we did, and I just have it, we just took a list of judges, and I thought what I would do is put this forward. And this would be the list I would either choose from or pick people very close in terms of the spirit and the meaning of what they represent. And of course Justice Scalia is mentioned in here as right up front as being just one of our great judges and one of our great justices.
HANNITY: This is your judicial philosophy. One of the things I think people have questioned -- I've interviewed you a lot during this process, and you gave me very specific things. And one of the top things I would ask you often is your judicial philosophy, and you mentioned, as I said, Scalia and Thomas. They are what we call originalists, constitutionalists.
TRUMP: Correct.
HANNITY: You are a constitutionalist.
TRUMP: Correct, correct. And I'm also -- I want high intellect. I want great intellect. These people are all of very high intellect. They're pro-life.
And so that's my list. And we are going to choose from most likely from this list. At a minimum we will keep people within this general realm. And, again, I have a lot of people that are conservative that really like me and love everything I stand for, but they really would like to know my views, because, perhaps outside of the defense of our country, perhaps the single most important thing the next president is going to have to do is pick Supreme Court justices.
HANNITY: It will have an impact for generations to come.
TRUMP: Generations. And I will say, if Hillary Clinton, who is doing very poorly in this whole rigged system that Sanders happens to be in, but if Hillary Clinton for some reason wins, your country will never be the same because she's going to put disasters on the Supreme Court. So these are - -
HANNITY: This is interesting because I think there might have been some people, I've talked to people on the radio show, and some people said Donald Trump is a recent convert to conservatism. And I asked you very specific questions. For example, you say you want a balanced budget. You actually told me once it's immoral to steal from our kids.
TRUMP: I do want a balanced budget. We could do a lot quickly. I have heard people say we'll the budget within 20 years. I'm saying 20 years, what are you talking about? I do want a balanced budget.
And you have to understand, I was born in New York and I really started my business in Brooklyn and Queens with my father but I moved to Manhattan and I started doing very, very well in Manhattan. And if you look at statistics on Manhattan, whether you like them or don't like them, it's very liberal, it's very Democrat, and I think that probably a lot of people feel because I come from essentially Manhattan I would be that way. And I wanted to put this list out because I wanted to quell any fears that people may have. This is a list of people that I got them from people I most respect.
HANNITY: You almost did it like a job interview.
TRUMP: Really, I vetted, but to a much greater extent the Federalist Society vetted and has tremendous respect. Heritage looked at it who I have great, great respect for. And I know Senator Sessions has brought the names around to different people in the Senate, and people have seen the list. And people have seen the list.

TRUMP: Ethics reform will be a crucial part of our 100-day plan as well. We're going to drain the swamp in Washington, D.C. You will see.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
HANNITY: President-elect Trump, he promised voters he would drain the swamp in Washington. So how will he do it? That's next as this special edition of ""HANNITY, Trump's Promises,"" continues.
HANNITY: And welcome back to this special edition of ""HANNITY, Trump's Promises."" So during the campaign, president-elect Trump, he vowed that if elected he would drain the swamp in Washington. In his contract with the American voter, Trump promised that he would propose an amendment that would put term limits on members of Congress and that he would reduce the influence of special interests. Here is what he said about this topic.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
HANNITY: Sean, you have seen things and I have seen things and I have been going through things. I've never -- nobody could imagine that this could happen in the United States. Nobody could even imagine it. But I'll tell you what, we're going to win the election and we're going to clean out the swamp. I'm using the expression we're going to drain the swamp of Washington D.C. It is a swamp of absolute corruption. It's absolutely corrupt. And we're going to drain the swamp. We'll see what happens. We're going to drain it. But we're going to win.
We have such enthusiasm. You saw what -- I just left this rally two minutes ago. In fact I'm sitting in a room that is like 200 degrees just like a steam room.
(LAUGHTER)
TRUMP: And no, it's just wonderful. But I'll tell you what. At least you are at the site of exposing some of this stuff. The press doesn't want to do it. It's incredible what's going on in our country.
Ethics are reform will be a crucial part of our 100-day plan as well. We're going to drain the swamp of corruption in Washington, D.C. Drain the swamp.
(APPLAUSE)
TRUMP: Thank you. I will oppose a five-year ban on executive branch officials becoming lobbyists and a lifetime ban on officials becoming lobbyists for a foreign government.
(APPLAUSE)
TRUMP: Change is not going to be easy. I am going to need you to fight as hard for these proposals as you fought for this great campaign of ours.
(APPLAUSE)
TRUMP: We are going to need our government and this movement to be more engaged and more vigilant than ever before to help us accomplish the reforms and overcome decades of stalemate and gridlock. We're going to get it done, folks.
Now that you put me in this position, even if you don't help me one bit, I'm going to get it done. Believe me. Don't worry about it.
(APPLAUSE)
TRUMP: It would be easier if you help, but that's all right. Don't worry. I'll get it done.
Importantly, we are all going to have open arms. And we're going to invite everyone from all political persuasions to join our movement to help us achieve our goals for this country -- great schools, safe neighborhoods, a thriving economy, and a government that answers only to the people, our people.
(APPLAUSE)
TRUMP: We are going to have to dig deep. And I know you and I and all of the people working with us are up to the task. There are a lot of people working with us.
Every single day, you will be the agents of change, change for our country, but good change, great change. Americans must ignore the pessimists and embrace the optimism that has always been the central ingredient of the American character.
We are the nation that won two world wars, that dug out the Panama Canal, that put a man on the moon and satellites all over space. But somewhere along the way, we started thinking small. I'm asking you to dream big again, and bold and daring things will happen for your country once again.
I'm asking you to join me in this next chapter of this unbelievable and unprecedented movement as we work toward prosperity at home, peace abroad, and new frontiers in science, technology, and space. I am asking you to -- is that right? Yes.
(LAUGHTER)
TRUMP: I am asking. I just love this guy. He's a believer. You're a believer, right?
(APPLAUSE)
TRUMP: I've asking you to believe in America once again. We have many challenges, but this is truly an exciting time to be alive. There's been no time like it. The script is not yet written. We do not know what the next page will read. I'll tell you, it's going to be a great page. But for the first time in a long time, what we do know is that the pages will be authored by each one of you, each one of you.
(APPLAUSE)

0	62	 63 von 72	Fox News Network	January 2, 2017 Monday	 THE KELLY FILE	 9:00 PM EST		"SANDRA SMITH, FOX NEWS HOST: A revolution is underway. The stands at the crossroads and the question tonight, how will the historic events of 2016 affect the next 12 months of our American story?
Good evening. Welcome to this KELLY FILE especial, I am Sandra Smith in for Megyn Kelly. At this time last year, we were looking ahead to the Iowa caucuses. Weighing the impact of the new Hollywood film on Benghazi and still reeling from the terror attack that left 14 dead and 22 injured in San Bernardino, California. We had no way to know that domestic terror would remain a constant for the coming year. That protest against police return deadly for some of those officers, or that the Republican primary would turn out quite the way it did.
In fact, from the moment Donald Trump descended the escalator at the now very familiar Trump Tower, true to the stunning wind that you saw coming in the final stretch of the campaign. Few could argue there was any bigger story in 2016 than this election. How Hillary Clinton sure thing failed to happen, and how a New York businessman succeeded against what seemed at times like impossible odds.
Our look back starts with Trace Gallagher and some of the biggest moments of the Republican primary. 
TRACE GALLAGHER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Sandra, the year and politics began with a slew of GOP presidential candidates, but by late January, one of them was building big momentum. In poll after poll, Donald Trump supporter said that almost nothing could make them change their mind about voting for him, and Trump himself acknowledged he could do no wrong.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENT-ELECT: I could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody, and I wouldn't lose any voters. Okay?
(END VIDEO CLIP)
GALLAGHER: Trump's comments came amid the fears national debate over gun control but the GOP front-runner made it clear he was not about to back away from his support of the Second Amendment or his criticism of what he called President Obama's attack on the Second Amendment. Trump went on to call for fewer gun restrictions and a stronger stance on terrorism. But just a week after making his controversial shoot someone on Fifth Ave comments, Donald Trump's road to the White House hit an Iowa speed bump when the first state to vote went for Ted Cruz.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
SEN. TED CRUZ (R), TEXAS: Iowa has sent notice that the Republican nominee in the next president of the United States will not be chosen by the media.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
GALLAGHER: On the Democratic side, by a razor-thin margin, Hillary Clinton took the Iowa caucuses, but she also took a hit when the State Department confirmed that Clinton did have top-secret material in her personal email account. The Clinton campaign called it over classification run amok. And while the Clinton dynasty still appeared strong, the Bush dynasty was fading. After a series of setbacks and a crushing defeat in the South Carolina primary, a estate his brother and father both won, in late February, Jeb Bush called it quits, saying there was nothing more he could do.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
JEB BUSH (R), FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: The people of Iowa and New Hampshire and South Carolina have spoken, and I really respect their decision. So, tonight, I am suspending my campaign.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
GALLAGHER: Meantime, Donald Trump continued to press the flesh and push the limits accusing U.S. District Court Judge Gonzalo Curiel of being hostile to him because of his Mexican heritage. Curiel was presiding over lawsuits against Trump University by students who claimed they got fleeced. Judge Curiel was born in Indiana. Trump's comments, notwithstanding, by Super Tuesday it appeared that he and Hillary Clinton were well under way to the general election. Both carving out dominant positions in their party's nominating races, but other candidates were not about to throw in the towel. With Trump being reminded by Marco Rubio that votes and size matter.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENT-ELECT: He referred to my hands that they are small, something else must be fall. I guarantee you there is no problem. I guarantee you.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
GALLAGHER: But by early May, Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz, and John Kasich would all be out of the race, leaving Trump with his party's official but on easy embrace.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (I-VT), FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Well, thank you.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
GALLAGHER: And for the Democrats, despite Bernie Sanders' cobbling together a string of primary victories, in early June, Hillary Clinton have the necessary number of delegates.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
HILLARY CLINTON (D), PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: Thanks to you, we have reached a milestone. First time in our nation's history that a woman will be a major party nomination.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
GALLAGHER: Some are arrived. The nominees were set and it was off to the conventions, which turned out to be as interesting as the election itself - - Sandra.
SMITH: All right. Trace Gallagher, thank you.
Joining us now is our panel of four tonight, Guy Benson is a FOX News contributor and political editor of Townhall.com. Chris Stirewalt is FOX News political politics editor. Richard Fowler is a FOX News contributor and senior fellow at The New Leaders Council. Rachel Campos-Duffy is a FOX News contributor. Good to have all of you here.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Happy New Year.
(LAUGHTER)
SMITH: Let's go back to the escalator ride because, wow, everybody said, I mean, there are people who said, this was a joke. There is no way this was going to happen. This was where it all began, Chris Stirewalt.
CHRIS STIREWALT, FOX NEWS POLITICAL POLITICS EDITOR: Well, it is where it began, and it was also the first episode of a dynamic that would actually lead to Trump's victory because it's the underestimation, it's the attack, it's the rejection that hardened his support. What Donald Trump did that we saw that panel play of candidates there, failed candidates there, what he did, what other people could not do was he gathered intense support around him. And he said, well, it was only a third. He only has about a third. But you know what, if you have got a firm one-third of the electorate and you are dividing it 16 ways, guess what, that is pretty good.
SMITH: And we were reminded by Trace's piece, how many special moments there were during that primary season.
GUY BENSON, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Special. Very special.
(LAUGHTER)
SMITH: Well, the audience didn't have the luxury of sharing their giggles throughout, but I mean, the moments when Marco Rubio stood on the stage and criticized the size of Donald Trump's hands. I mean, it went there.
BENSON: Yes. And needling him. I think that when we went back and look at that time line, I remember Iowa feeling like this seminal event in this process because Trump had been leading basically everywhere, including in the polls in Iowa --
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Right.
BENSON: And then he came out, lost those caucuses, and he said, okay, may be the loss of political gravity do apply to this guy. And then he comes out and has a resounding victory in New Hampshire, goes down and has that while debate in South Carolina where he's got food and he's slamming the bushes, and he wins handily in South Carolina. At that point, I think he was in the driver's seat and there was no turning back.
SMITH: So, that was the big moment for you. Richard, when did you say, I don't know, this guy might have a chance? Or did you ever say?
RICHARD FOWLER, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: I mean, I thought he had a chance of being the nominee. And I think the chance, sort of the moment that I had the realization was when all of these other Republican candidates started just falling on themselves. And I think the moment for me was when Ted Cruz was like, I am going to make a special announcement, I am going to pick a vice presidential candidate. And he picked Carly Fiorina, and we're like, what? Did that just happen? Are you supposed to do that? Is that part of the rules of politics? I think what Donald Trump shows us is that for the primary season, you can just sort of play it by ear to be president of the United States.
SMITH: And there was always that conversation about dollars that were being spent, obviously.
RACHEL CAMPOS-DUFFY, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Right.
SMITH: Eventually, we saw so much more spent with Hillary Clinton versus Donald Trump, but even the other Republicans he was up against. Donald Trump had the free media. I mean, he was on the TV all the time.
CAMPOS-DUFFY: It was free media, but if you really look at it, I mean, what I find really heartening about the whole primary process was that at least on the Republican side, money didn't determine who would win. I mean, he spent the least amount of money. Again, the escalator moment for me, I thought that was brilliant. It was what defined them as different. I am not playing by the playbook of all these politicians. I thought he could win very early on. I was in rural Wisconsin. I could feel it, they liked it, they wanted somebody that didn't seem like a politician, and boy, this guy really fit the bill.
BENSON: You know, and Sandra, when you go back to the escalator moment --
(LAUGHTER)
STIREWALT: This is going to be good. This is going to be good.
BENSON: Yes. I remember watching it. I was watching it live as it happen, and he came down, there were reports that he actually hired actors and supporters. He was kind of going on this sort of --
STIREWALT: Free association.
BENSON: Consciousness of speech. He had this like spittle on the side of his mouth. At one point they brought the music out. No, cut the music and he went on for 20 more minutes. And I was like, okay, this is ridiculous. This is not a real campaign. But about a month later, once he had made a few comments like the McCain comment, I prefer people who weren't captured and that kind of thing, once he was not really taking a dent in his primary point out, like, all right, underestimating this guy, this point is a real mistake. And I think it took the other campaigns way too long to figure that out.
STIREWALT: Well, and they also, remember, the Republicans believe when you said earlier that the laws of political gravity would apply, when you look at how Donald Trump ended up, he ended up as a pretty conventional Republican nominee. Not in style certainly but in his votes. He ended up with about 40 percent of the vote which is about what Mitt Romney and John McCain did. He ended up winning in about the same amount of time, the same number of weeks of contest that they did. We looked for reasons why it wasn't so. We looked for reasons why aren't these polls predictive. Well, they are not predictive because this 16 other guys are going to coalesce at some point.
SMITH: You fess up that you did that.
STIREWALT: Yes. I did exactly that. I look for ways to explain what why isn't this pull through because Donald Trump was such an un-orthodox candidate. And he was violating all of the norms of politics. So, why isn't this true? But in fact, the polls were right. The polls were predictive, and that is exactly what happened.
SMITH: So, you learn something, didn't you?
STIREWALT: Yes.
CAMPOS-DUFFY: He wasn't speaking to -- I mean, he wasn't speaking to the political class. I mean, I think that's what was really interesting. He went right over the heads and to the people. And there were somebody who I wish I could give them credit for it, but he said, the media and the consultants took him literally but not seriously.
(CROSSTALK)
CAMPOS-DUFFY: Yes. And the people on the ground, the people on Wisconsin and in Michigan took him seriously but not literally, and I think that really kind of sums it up for me.
STIREWALT: I think there is something to be said about Donald Trump's, you know, sort of rise, and I think the media played a part in this. Right? He had a little game going on between him in the media. We hate you. You hate us. We are still going to talk to each other. And I think that was part of the, you have to call it magic behind this campaign. Because the media covered him incessantly more than any of the other candidates.
FOWLER: And you go back to the words of Ted Cruz there that Trace had in his piece. Iowa has sent notice that the Republican nominee and the next president of the United States will not be chosen by the media.
BENSON: Wrong.
STIREWALT: Wrong.
(LAUGHTER)
BENSON: Because look, that was a thing, there was a lot of complaining, and I think it is a fair criticism to at least some introspection is in order for the media. But covering wall-to-wall rallies, constantly for Trump, but --
CAMPOS-DUFFY: If you are entertaining them --
BENSON: If you're entertaining rallies, so it is like the symbiotic relationship that he took advantage of. And at these rallies that the media were covering for free for him on prime time, frequently. He would have the crowd turned around and boo the media. That was sort of doing him a favor. It was a fascinating dynamic.
CAMPOS-DUFFY: If you had the best rally, then you get the most immediate attention. I think it is fair.
SMITH: Right. Don't give away who won, because we will going to get to that next. While millions of Trump supporters felt the sense of real victory when he did win the nomination, they couldn't know what was about to happen next. Or how the fallout would continue to echo until today. That part of our story when we come back.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
TRUMP: First of all, they were all lies. They were made up stories. They were fabricated. Whether they like Hillary or whether they just want to become a little bit famous or something, every one of those charges were false, and they were lies
(END VIDEO CLIP)
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
TRUMP: Friends, delegates, and fellow Americans, I humbly and gratefully accept your nomination for the presidency of the United States.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
(END VIDEO CLIP)
SMITH: Well, the critics found a lot not to like about the Republican National Convention in Cleveland, but that moment, right there, was an undeniably powerful event in the course of an improbable candidacy. The joy, however, it would be short-lived. In less than two weeks, Donald Trump would find himself at the heart of a new firestorm. After a gold star family attacked Trump's policies on stage at the Democratic National Convention and Trump unleashed a fierce response on twitter, then came the real drama.
Someone leaked a videotape from an ""Access Hollywood"" shoot that featured an unguarded Donald Trump talking with Billy Bush and making very lewd comments about women. When Trump tried to defend the remarks, a series of women then came forward accusing him of sexual harassment. An incident that stretched back decades. His poll numbers dropped sharply, and a number of Republicans started to move away.
Then a new political story started to emerge. Wikileaks began dumping an increasing number of embarrassing emails hacked from the DNC. The emails featured prominent Democrats talking about Mrs. Clinton, her political judgment, and the multimillion dollar workings of her foundation. Now she was on the defense. And then the bombshell. Friday, October 20th, the FBI Director James Comey announces the bureau is reopening the investigation into Mrs. Clinton's emails. Writing, quote, ""Because those emails appear to be pertinent to our investigation, I agreed that we should take appropriate steps to obtain and review them.""
Less than two weeks later, still down in the polls and counted out by most political observers, Donald J. Trump won the working class vote in several democratic states by huge margins. Becoming our President-elect in the most stunning political story in a long time. Back with us now.
A man who -- you watch this so closely, every single day, Chris Stirewalt, and yet we look at so many who got it so wrong. But Donald Trump made it through all of those controversies. It is unbelievable when you look back at it.
STIREWALT: He learned. He learned something really important, and it didn't click for him until the end. The way that he won the Republican nomination was by cording controversy and kicking his way through firestorm after firestorm. Never apologize, never backed down. Yes, John McCain, I am not going to apologize to John McCain, blah, blah, blah and just fight, fight, fight and it worked. It kept the attention on him. But it was differed in in the general direction. The fight that he engaged in with the Khan family.
The fight that he had with Alicia Machado who was the former Miss Universe that he had called -- and all of these stuffs. It didn't work. It hurt him, but then he figured it out. Make yourself like a hole in the water, man. Lay down. You be quiet, give teleprompter speeches, act in a more restrained way, he did. No press conferences. He had no controversies for the final three weeks of the election, and he just watched Hillary Clinton twist and the wind around the FBI stuff and let her have that attention. And with it came the negative footage.
SMITH: And which time you have to remind everybody he is not a politician. He is a New York businessman. How did he know that?
FOWLER: There are two words, Kellyanne Conway.
(LAUGHTER)
Kellyanne Conway whether -- no matter what type of aisle you are on, Kellyanne Conway is one of the best operatives, I would argue. She tops the list. She's close to Karl Rove when it comes to topping the list and how to win an election. But there is something to be said that I think the Clinton campaign sort of dropped the ball here. We said from the beginning of this, I do believe they mishandled the emails, but I am beyond mishandling the email, which I think in the grand scheme of things, it is sort of a lot of Americans say, okay, we sort of thought she might not be trustworthy, maybe she's not trustworthy, we are not going to vote for her.
She had a problem communicating with the American people. I think they depended on just talking, you know, like we are going to go after our democratic basis. You'd never visited the state of Wisconsin once. Their campaign was overconfident, and they didn't have a real conversation with the American people, whether you like Barack Obama or not. In both and 2008 and 2012, he really honed in on having a conversation with the American people which is why he won.
SMITH: He always struggled with women throughout. Well, apparently, everybody thought he was struggling with women throughout, and you look at back at that ""Access Hollywood"" moment. And I know even those who warmed up to them said, oh, and you know, and we saw that from some key Republicans who had decided to support him. They step back. That seemed like the breaking moment for Donald Trump.
CAMPOS-DUFFY: But it didn't. I think Chris hit on a moment. He kind of apologized, but ultimately, he is still a fighter. That is what people liked about him. Even women who are sort of, you know, disgusted by the video thought, you know, remember, this is all in the context of terrorism that is still going on, the Orlando incident. And so I think that looking like you are a fighter, looking like, okay, I am not the greatest, you know, I'm not as good with women, and I said these things and I am kind of sorry about them, but he looked like he was going to fight for you and protect your family.
And again, he came to Wisconsin. I was in that state six times. That was a #NeverTrump state. He came six times. Made many mistakes there. You know, going after Walker. You know, nonetheless, he came. And she didn't. And I think that he just, he fought through this, never apologize, I think all of those things made a big difference.
SMITH: And all the while, he always had his family standing by him, who even if they didn't like him, they like them.
BENSON: Right. And his wife, his daughter helped him get through some of those issues with women, and one thing that the media talked about incessantly throughout this process was the gender gap problem that he had. And he did have one with women, and they ignored the fact that Hillary Clinton had a big gender gap problem herself. I mean, that is half the electorate to you guys. So, the other thing that I thought was interesting, I'm reminded by this Richard when you were talking, it seemed to your point at the very beginning of the segment, it seemed like whichever candidate was in the spotlight, the world would fall in the polls.
So, the fact that it was Hillary Clinton at the very end, the, you know, the corruption of the foundation, the emails, that whole scandal, she was the last sort of thought that people had, it was the last impression that the campaign is all about her, and she is not a popular figure and she lost.
SMITH: I mean, you mentioned John McCain, that was a huge moment. He is not a war here. I don't like guys who get caught. Yes. And then there was the Khan family.
STIREWALT: Yes.
SMITH: I mean, which stood out to you as perhaps the judge?
STIREWALT: The judge was very bad. And the judge was the point. You know, the thing about Trump, and I think Rachel is quite right, that his supporters like his refusal to apologize, to never back down. That part is good. But until he learned to take instruction, and his failure with the judge, that was a debacle. And that was actually won the Republican Party had to make a triage decision. That was the moment where the Republican Party said, can we fix them or do we have to abandon him?
And the fact that Trump, and that was the moment when he took on, as you'll recall, more Washington insiders into his organization, more political professors came on board, that is when you started to see a shift away from his original team into a more seasoned group of operatives that took charge. That's when he normalized his campaign. And that's actually, ironically, his -- that debacle with the Mexican judge which may have saved his chances.
BENSON: Well, that's another name that we should bring up during the firestorm, and there were several of them actually.
STIREWALT: Right.
BENSON: One guy who said, you know what, this is my job to support the nominee and did so vociferously and relentlessly was Reince Priebus. The RNC chairman stuck with him the whole time. And now Reince Priebus is going to be, you know, the chief-of-staff.
SMITH: Constantly rewarded.
(LAUGHTER)
FOWLER: Exactly.
SMITH: And meanwhile, the left looked on, media looked on and didn't quite get it.
FOWLER: No, I think, look, like I said, the Clinton campaign, they were overconfident. All the pollsters were wrong. I remember (INAUDIBLE) pollsters days before the election, I think there some white guys amongst him. No, it is not there. It was all the loopholes leading up to election.
STIREWALT: No, no, no.
FOWLER: The state poll.
STIREWALT: The state polling in Wisconsin was hot garbage. It was a debacle. National polls, and I say this as a person that I have some interest in this, that the national polls were quite right.
CAMPOS-DUFFY: But there was -- I mean, Chris, to be fair, there really was an underreported Trump vote.
FOWLER: Yes, there was. In Wisconsin.
SMITH: Okay. Fine. But I would say, in Wisconsin, I knew people who were going to Trump fundraisers who wouldn't put a Trump sign in front of their house. I mean, there was a significant amount of people, I think nationwide, who were afraid to say that they were for Trump because with that came the stigma of racism and all these other things.
FOWLER: And I think the group -- the leading group among them were white women. Right? We all expected Hillary Clinton to get her own demographic of people, which he managed to lose.
SMITH: The conversation at dinner tables across the country.
All right. Well, as the election unfolded, America was reminded several times of the stakes. As we dealt with the series of domestic terror attacks from Orlando, Florida, to the big apple.
Up next, the challenge of stopping the next one before it happens.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This was an act of violence born out of hate that inflicted terror and the entire community, so I would call it a hate crime, I would call it terrorism.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
KELLY WRIGHT, FOX NEWS HOST: Live from America's News Headquarters, I'm Kelly Wright in Washington. Good evening, here is what happening. President-elect Donald Trump's latest tweet reads, quote, ""It won't happen."" He is referring to North Korea's claim that the rogue nation is in the final stage of testing an intercontinental ballistic missile. But it is unclear if Mr. Trump's twitter means he would stop Kim Jong-un from launching that weapon or if he simply -- nuclear capabilities. Mr. Trump's aides have yet to explain.
This might be the last time you see this. The Obama family departing Air Force One. They are back at the White House after a Christmas vacation in Hawaii. Aides tell us, the President will largely spent his last three weeks in office trying to protect his health care law, which Republicans vowed to abolish. Mr. Obama is planning to deliver a major farewell speech next week in Chicago.
And that's a look at news in Washington, I am Kelly Wright, back now to a special KELLY FILE roundtable, the year in review.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We're losing site even now, he said what he said that tell Americans we are going to bomb this country and we need to deal with that part of it.
MEGYN KELLY, FOX NEWS HOST: Omar Mateen.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes. Omar Mateen.
KELLY: As he was shooting?
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: As he was shooting people in the bathroom. And we need to deal with that part. As far as prevention, as far as security. What are we doing as Americans as far as administration to make sure that we are protecting our American people on our soil? What are we doing? If you met this man or you interviewed this person by the FBI's multiple times before this even happened, how did he get access to guns?
(END VIDEO CLIP)
SMITH: That was Patience Carter, one of the survivors of the hours long terror attack at an Orlando nightclub joining a special group on THE KELLY FILE early this year. And Miss Carter was raising a question we've heard time and time again this year. As we witness a variety of violent attacks on U.S. soil being perpetrated in the name of Islam.
In January, a Philadelphia police officer is ambushed in his patrol car by a man who later pledged allegiance to ISIS. In February, a machete wielding man shouting ""god is great"" in Arabic began slashing customers at a Columbus, Ohio, restaurant. And we later learned that the FBI had reportedly investigated him years earlier for alleged threats, but abandoned the investigation. That of course brings us to Orlando where Omar Mateen pledged allegiance to ISIS and phone calls with police after killing nearly 50 people and routing more than 50 others. In New York, the man allegedly behind a bombing in New York's Chelsea neighborhood also pledged allegiance to radical groups. And just last month, and Ohio State University students seem to be following in ISIS playbook when he plowed his car into a group of people on campus before lunging at others with a knife.
Back now with our panel, Guy, Chris, Richard, and Rachel. Guy, it does appear at least that in the year of 2016, that this has become the new normal.
GUY BENSON, TOWNHALL.COM: Yes, and it was something that really scared a lot of Americans. I think, you know, previously in the show, we've been talking so much about the politics of the year, and had an effect. You had Donald Trump, whether you thought that he was responsible or knowledgeable enough about these national security issues, he was somebody who at least seem to cut through the clutter and say let's face it, this is the problem, let's call it by name.
A lot of other setback and contracted what he was saying with the administration. Like Loretta Lynch, the Attorney General, after the attack in Orlando which was particularly heartbreaking. She said, despite having heard those 911 calls where he was very explicit, the killer, saying he was doing this for ISIS on behalf of ISIS. He was an Islamist. We may never really know exactly what his motives are. And voter's setback and say, all right that is B.S., he is at least not spouting complete B.S. He is calling this by its name, Radical Islamic Terrorism. He was (inaudible) by the elites. Why is he obsessing about this rhetorical question? Well I think he knows why. I think it hit home with a lot of people who were scared because of these horrible attacks.
SMITH: It was part shock for Americans to hear him use those words when our own president was it. Richard, he would take to twitter even, and use the words Radical Islamic terror or point to something Terrorism, when it haven't even defined such yet by the President of the United States.
RICHARD FOWLER, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR AND SENIOR FELLOW FOR THE NEW LEADERS COUNSEL: Well I mean there something to be sick, and I've debated this into sort of wrestled with this the way that we use the term radical Islam or not. I have gone to the side of not using the word because I think when you use it you create stereotypes. Whether we like what happened or what it was most touching for me was that when that happened at the polls nightclub in Orlando. And I think what made it so touching is that beyond the fact that this guy who made a pledge to ISIS or so have you, but he committed a hate crime and killed 50 people and what is deemed by the LGBT community of state place where you can freely express yourself, he took that away. So that really I think we should have to understand. We have to work with moving on in the country and finding out how we all come together, whether -- the only way were going to get - we are going to need moderate Muslims also to stand up and say that we don't agree with this, we are not a part of this. And so when you say radical Islam and you make blanket statement, what end up happening is.
CHRIS STIREWALT, FOX NEWS DECISION DESK CORRESPONDENT: I don't think that is blanket it is radical not Islam.
FOWLER: No, no, it is perceived as blanket when you out getting any of the facts. Like for example, in the New York City bombing, he took a couple of days before he called it radical Islam.
STIREWALT: Obama got the facts.
FOWLER: We would say. I don't care how you all do it. We would say that the motives of killers matter in understanding how to stop them.
STIREWALT: I agree.
FOWLER: And Dylan Roof were example in South Carolina, was a white nationalist and a terrorist.
STIREWALT: Yes, yes, yes, quite so.
FOWLER: His motives to properly understand how to prevent that from happening and understand that we have a sickness in our culture. It spreads on social media, and of the interconnectedness of everything is great for sharing chocolate chip cookies recipes and videos of cute dogs, but is also really effective as spreading discussing ideologies. One of those happens to be, it is this is a word I use, ""Islamism."" it is about Islam, it is about Islamism and a belief that you can't bring by force the political philosophy.
STIREWALT: I think this is my problem with it. What we saw take place, Omar Mateen what we saw took place in the New York City bombing. That is people who are radicalized. I would argue they are not Islamic, because the religion itself.
FOWLER: They say they are Islamic.
STIREWALT: That is my point. You say they are Islam appears to go out when you use words like radical Islam and you route a whole group of people that people believe in Allah, as being radical, which is what ends up happening.
SMITH: Rachel, I want to get you in here because the political point then is, are we safer now than we were eight years ago?
RACHEL CAMPOS-DUFFY, FOX AND FRIENDS CO-HOST: Exactly. You know, when Donald Trump would have us arise, he doesn't want to say, I want to make America great again, he end with we are going to make America safe again, which is very appealing to many moms, including Midwest moms and at rest that there were so important when just seeing a stabbing, by the way, in St. Cloud Minnesota mall. Some place things you never thought you would see on an ISIS is inspired stabbing.
We have to go back to the root of this. There was a point when ISIS -- the president called ISIS that JB Team. Under President Obama's watch, ISIS grew and cast his eyes and became a name that these lone wolves could catch themselves with, because they were succeeding in their efforts in the Middle East in Iran, in Iraq and in Syria. Truthfully, all of this -- voters are not stupid. They have to know all the intricacies of Middle East policy to know ISIS is to blame here. ISIS grew under this guy's watch. ISIS grew -- our president called it a JB team and dismissed it. Even had CIA reports that for an order to release a narrative that there is --
BENSON: ISIS created a power vacuum in Iraq that created ISIS.
CAMPOS-DUFFY: And why would there be a power vacuum, where it should not.
BENSON: We'll be on first that ISIS first started under George W. Bush, but that is beyond the point. The president, no matter what policies passed, cannot stop people from radicalizing on the internet. If we carpet bomb Barack and a Syria and killed all of ISIS we would still be allowed to radicalize on the internet, which is why I found the word radical Islam be problematic.
SMITH: Last words guys. To go I don't know how that follows.
BENSON: I just don't consider that Fowler. They consider themselves member of the religion, but being on the religion should not make you a radical.
SMITH: This is a heated discussion. We have so much more. 2016 also saw a dramatic turn of events and an angry debate over policing and race. With more than a dozen cops targeted and ambushed out attacks. Up next, the Black Lives Matter Movement and the Trump administration.
SMITH: One of the most dramatic moments of 2016 unfolded right on this broadcast, as ""The Kelly File"" covered live protests in Dallas, Texas, that ended in an unthinkable ambush style assault against police, and the death of five officers.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
KELLY: We are looking back in Dallas, Texas. This is disturbing. I'm not sure what we are seeing, but it looks from this vantage point like an officer down. We are not sure. We are not sure. This is my speculation as I look at the screen, standby, and that I don't know what I am seeing. This is the control room trying to tell me that they have a better vantage point. I am sorry for the speculation. The police are working on. We are all seeing this together. This is not clear.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
SMITH: The process that and I were in reaction to two officers involved shootings occurring just one day apart. The first on July 5th, when Alton Sterling is shot and killed by police outside of a Baton Rouge convenience store, the following day, another black man, Philando Castile a shot and killed in Minnesota during a traffic stop. A couple months later, tensions further escalate when Terrence Crutcher is fatally shot in Oklahoma by a white police officer after his car breaks down. In the same week, Keith Lamont Scott is shot and killed in Charlotte after police say he exited his vehicle with a weapon, all these incidents contributing to a state of height and hostility against law enforcement. That manifest through a series of violent targeting of police in Baton Rouge, three officers are killed after a Missouri man goes on a shooting rampage in the City where Alton Sterling is killed. In Iowa, two officers in separate locations are gunned down to sitting in their patrol vehicles. And less than three weeks later, four police officers are shot in separate incidences around the country in targeted attacks in Florida, Texas, and Missouri. Overall, 16 officers are killed in ambush style attacks in 2016, tying 2014 for the highest number on record in two decades. I am joined again by Fox News Politics Editor Chris Stirewalt, Fox News Contributor Richard Fowler, and Rachel Campos-Duffy, and Guy Benson, unbelievable look back at this year, Richard?
FOWLER: This all starts in one place. There needs to be more trust between community of color and law enforcement departments. I think that is where we start this conversation. We are starting to have real conversations with each other. How do we work together? How do we get rid of the unconcealed bias that existed on both sides?
SMITH: There is it confirmed that we don't have an answer for that because we do hear from police officers in this country that feel like they can't carry out their jobs.
CAMPOS-DUFFY: Absolutely. Remember, Dallas was supposed to be the shining example of community-based policing and, you know it happened there, despite all that.
STIREWALT: But isn't it? Doesn't it? Didn't Dallas -- these officers did the most noble thing. They gave their lives to protect people who were protesting them. Not an abstract, there was not a bank robbery. This was not a hold of. These officers put their lives on the line and ultimately sacrifice them to protect the rights of individuals to protest the police. They did that. The police chief of Dallas gave a eulogy, gave a speech, at that memorial service, it was attended by the way, but a fantastic patriotic grace by the previous Republican president, a white man, and at the current Democratic president, a black man. That was at the moment, I think, that brought America back from the brink. I think Dallas, the tragedy of Dallas, as heartrending as it was, but that police chief's impassioned plea sincere and a passion play to do what, get in the game. If you don't like the way this works, get in the game. Go become a police officer. Join us. Help us. Do this. And I thought it was a great -- I was so proud of my country that day.
SMITH: It makes you wonder where we are as we start a new year.
BENSON: Sometimes we seem to be talking past each other on some of these issues, and people say black lives matter, what about all these other people's lives? Other people say blue eyes matter. You were born a police officer. I think that we can try and embrace these terms and of the sentiments on their own terms and respect it. So look, I think, sometimes some people on the right tend to in a reflexive way assume always that the police are correct. And obviously, and some of the cases, every case should be taking on its own merit of what actually happened. And some cases, the police are wrong and there should be consequences. A lot of conservatives and liberals can come together on the criminal justice reform. I saw this video MTV put out a few weeks ago, it was pretty widely ridiculed online. It was sort of scolding white men about how to think and talk about everything. One of the ones with blue lives matter, isn't a thing. Excuse me, after 2016 and what we just saw play out in this country, to try and scolding they tell people that blue lives matter.
(CROSSTALK)
CAMPOS-DUFFY: That was that frustration with Black Lives Matter Movement. I think there are people who have legitimate feelings about certain incidents, whether they were fair or not, but I feel like Black Lives Matter have this blanket -- like there is this undercurrent of racism that runs throughout law enforcement, and that was offensive. I think what people saw -- let me finish -- what people saw with Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton, that frustrated them was that they gave credibility to that movement by inviting them to the White House, four panels, and Hillary Clinton meeting with them, as opposed to, because I feel like they were a very radical group.
FOWLER: That is part of the problem. I don't think they are radical, if you look at the pictures that we are showing here.
CAMPOS-DUFFY: Come on.
FOWLER: Because they are not only black people. They are Latinos, they are white folks. I have been at Black Lives Matter protest with white women in strollers, because they understand that it is not, wait a minute - - that is the one sound bite that conservatives play, but truth be told, Black Lives Matter Movement is a question. It is a question. Do black lives really matter? We saw all the states, if you can kill Alton Sterling just blindly and not be charged until they are protesting the streets, then you have a problem. There is no due process.
CAMPOS-DUFFY: I have the same question too.
STIREWALT: 2016 was a question. 2016 itself is a question to whom does America belong? To whom does America -- whose country is this anyway? It is not me, and it is not you. It is all of us.
BENSON: It should be.
SMITH: Thank you, Chris Stirewalt. All right coming up beyond domestic terror or attacks on police, there was one other story that managed to break through all the election coverage in a very big way, and that is next.
SMITH: Beyond domestic terror or attacks on police, there was one other story that managed to break through all the election coverage in a very big way, and it came at the Olympics games in Rio this summer, the Olympic Games. Across a competition, Americans were a shining example of athletic excellence, earning 121 medals, 46 of which were gold. But at the end, that became overshadowed by a bizarre incident. At a real gas station that involves four U.S. swimmers, including Ryan Lochte, who first explained the event like this.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
RYAN LOCHTE, OLMYPIC SWIMMER: They pulled out their guns. They pulled us to get down on the ground. We got down on the ground. I was like, we didn't do anything wrong. So I am not getting down on the ground. This guy pulled out his gun. He put it to my forehead, and he said get down. I put my hands up. I said whatever. He took our money, he took my wallet.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
(LAUGHTER)
SMITH: Police and in Brazil didn't find evidence to support Lochte's story. And you know the surveillance video. Lochte eventually apologized and admitted to over exaggerating events. He was suspended from swimming for ten months, while several key sponsors and was charged by Brazil police for filing a false report.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
LOCHTE: You know it was still hours after the incident happened -- I was still intoxicated. I was still under the influence, and I am not making me being intoxicated like an excuse. I am not doing that at all. It was my fault, and I shouldn't have said it. I shouldn't -- I should not have said anything, but I over exaggerated that part. The gun was drawn, but not at my forehead. It wasn't cocked at my forehead. It was towards my general direction.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
SMITH: And our panel is back with us now to discuss that. At times, it was difficult to watch that story.
CAMPOS-DUFFY: For sure.
STIREWALT: It will get on you man. It will get after you, when you get after it. I think that as a meditation on celebrity and all of that jazz, it was a perfect -- it was a perfect moment for 2016. Perfect instructional moment for 2016, Ryan Lochte got more famous and famouser and famouser.
BENSON: Dancing with the stars.
STIREWALT: Dancing with the starts after all of this. His agent probably said, on the whole you're arrested in Brazil was bad, but maybe not too terrible. I got my check and it was great.
BENSON: I hated the story so much. I never want to let this one clown overshadow what team USA accomplished.
SMITH: Thank you.
BENSON: The women's gymnastics team, in particular, was incredible. I always get a little goosebumby when I see the flag go up and the anthem playing. But I have to say we are talking about sports very quickly, 2016, you have to mention for my friends in Chicago, the Cubs.
CAMPOS-DUFFY: Go cubs!
BENSON: Years of misery come at the end for those fans. You got to be happy for them.
SMITH: There will never be a greater sports story than the Chicago Cubs.
STIREWALT: Boo!
FOWLER: I think it was sad about the Lochte story is that it really overshadow the athleticism of the Olympics, beyond just the Americans. You sample set another world record.
SMITH: If you let it overshadow, it does.
CAMPOS-DUFFY: Some interesting lessons, one it all came cannot because he lied to his mom. As a lesson to everyone, do not lie to your mom. Says that the mother of eight children. Do not lie to your mom.
Also again, I just think it really speaks to how America really is the land of second chances. I mean it was almost.
BENSON: Come on!
STIREWALT: Come on!
FOWLER: Come on.
CAMPOS-DUFFY: If you go on ""Dancing with the stars"" you get to start all over.
BENSON: You can do the cha-cha and all goes away.
CAMPOS-DUFFY: It is a new year.
(LAUGHTER)
SMITH: Come on, be positive. I didn't overshadow if you didn't let it. There were so many fantastic stories that came out of the Olympics.
STIREWALT: If you say so.
CAMPOS-DUFFY: Oh!
STIREWALT: There were.
SMITH: The Ryan Lochte thing, when you go to the bizarre details of that story. It was crazy.
FOWLER: It sounded like me at 17 lying to my parents about (inaudible).
You should always have a designated driver. Make sure you have a designated friend who makes sure everybody gets back to where you are.
STIREWALT: Do that for your friends?
FOWLER: No.
(LAUGHTER)
I said friends, somebody else to it. That is not me, let someone else do it.
SMITH: It all ends and in the cha-cha at ""Dancing with the stars"".""
STIREWALT: Always.
SMITH: A look back at 2016 and what a year that was to live and experience that moment in history for America, whether it was a 2016 Olympics or that unbelievably crazy election.
STIREWALT: The cubs win.
SMITH: Sometimes there is not Billy Goat curse, right? Thanks to all of you for joining us tonight. We have so much more. We will be right back.
SMITH: I want to thank all my guess, because this was so much fun, fun to start a new year with you. Does anybody have any resolutions they want to share? You got like five seconds.
STIREWALT: Just to be more awesome and more excellent in every way on The Kelly File.
CAMPOS-DUFFY: The more is the key word there, because you already are.
SMITH: Anybody else, I don't know.
FOWLER: I don't do New Year's resolutions.
(CROSSTALK)
CAMPOS-DUFFY: Guy, I just had a baby.
SMITH: Thank you for watching I am Sandra Smith and this is ""The Kelly File."""
0	63	 64 von 72	Fox News Network	January 2, 2017 Monday	 THE O'REILLY FACTOR	 8:00 PM EST		"BILL O'REILLY, FOX NEWS HOST, ""THE O'REILLY FACTOR"": Special edition of THE O'REILLY FACTOR is on tonight.
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
O'REILLY (voice-over): It's our ""Big Interviews, Big Issues Special.""
DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENT-ELECT: I will compare my IQ with anybody, okay.
O'REILLY: Donald Trump will be the next president of United States after a whirlwind election. 
TRUMP: Now, it is time for America to bine the wounds of division.
O'REILLY: Oliver Stone and I debated national security.
If you want the protection of agencies, they have to have some, you know, a blanket of ability to tap.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: They do have an invasive ability beyond all measure supported by a technological machine that is incredible.
O'REILLY: Award-winning Director Adam McKay and I revisit the great decision of 2008 and his movie ""The Big Short.""
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We really look at this issue of something that goes beyond right or left wing. It obviously affected everyone.
O'REILLY: Also, looking back at the murder of Martha Moxley all these years later, Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., lays out some interesting revelations that could shed a different light on his cousin Michael Skakel.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: He had a very acute case of post-traumatic stress syndrome.
(END VIDEOTAPE)
O'REILLY: Caution, you are about to enter the No Spine Zone. The FACTOR begins right now.
Hi, I am Bill O'Reilly. Thanks for watching us tonight for the special edition of THE FACTOR. The year's presidential election has been one of the most momentous and contentious, that rhymes in American history. It all began back in June, 2015. When then presidential hopeful Donald Trump appeared with me on THE FACTOR right after his big announcement that he intended to seek a nomination for president of the United States. Well, since then, we have spoken dozens of times with Mr. Trump over the past 18 months, discussing what he would do as president and his take on the twists and turns of the presidential race. Take a look.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
O'REILLY: ObamaCare. Not doing well, I think any measure, any fair-minded person would say, a lot of Americans are getting hurt, have to pay more for their premiums, more deductibles, they are getting their choices of doctors, file down. It doesn't seem though that the democratic base, which wanted ObamaCare so much, cares. They don't seem to care, you don't see an outrage building on the left about ObamaCare. I'm wondering if you know why that is.
TRUMP: I think they care. I think people care. I think people are getting wiped out. And the numbers they gave, you know, 24, 25 percent increase, I don't believe that. I think the minimum is going to be 40 percent and 50 percent. Yes. I think the people are going to care.
O'REILLY: All right. Can you tell me simply because you know I am a simple man and have trouble grasping complicated situations, you say, you are going to revoke and replace ObamaCare. I know you want to have insurance companies compete nationwide, and no boundaries, and that would drive premiums down. What else? Are you going to subsidize 30 million people who can't afford assurance? Are you going to help them out?
TRUMP: I like the concept of health care's savings account, I think it is great. You must get rid of the boundaries between the states so we have competition because right now, you'll have competition --
O'REILLY: But what about the insurance companies? You know, one of the reasons the ObamaCare thing is going through the roof is because there are 30 million Americans having trouble doing anything, they can't work, they don't work, whatever, and now the Obama administration is giving them free health care. Will you continue that?
TRUMP: All right. So, well I view it as, I view it as two groups. The people that can afford it, it will be much lower, much better, much lower price, and really phenomenal, they will be tremendous competition. By the way, there will be plans that you are not even talking about right now because the competition will make great plans. But much lower price, much better. Now, you're going to block rent, Medicaid to the states and they're going to take care of the people that can knock take care of themselves.
O'REILLY: Okay. So, the states get the responsibility to do that.
TRUMP: Absolutely.
O'REILLY: When you see how you're being treated, not only by the national press, but say ""Saturday Night Live,"" we got Alec Baldwin now doing you, Kate McKinnon doing Mrs. Clinton. Do you feel that it is a coordinated? There is no doubt that most of the press, and I said this from the very beginning, you are a member, I told you that the day you announce that you were going to get hammered, personally, not just because of your policies, but because they don't like you, they don't think you are worthy for this job, you know, all of that.
TRUMP: No, they don't like what I stand for.
O'REILLY: It stopped, too, it is more you.
TRUMP: I mean, look, I will compare my IQ with anybody, okay? So, they don't like --
O'REILLY: But if you compare you to Romney --
TRUMP: They don't want voters --
O'REILLY: They don't like Romney --
TRUMP: Excuse me --
O'REILLY: But it wasn't as personal as against you. It is personal against you.
TRUMP: Well, I'm very proud to say, they say, this is the all-time pylon and history, in terms of --
O'REILLY: So, my question is, is it coordinated? Do you believe it is coordinated?
TRUMP: Yes. I do think so. Before I ran, I used to get great press. My wife said the other day, she said, he used to never get a bad story. Well, I got somebody but I got very few. Now, I have like, I can be in the front page of ""The New York Times"" in three different stories in every one of them is a hit job. And you understand that. Now, it is a very unfair price. I knew it would be bad, I didn't know it would be this bad. I used to talk I said, boy, am I going to get hit? Because I stand for strong borders, we have to strengthen our country, we're not going to have a country if we don't have borders, people are pouring across.
O'REILLY: I don't know if anybody can bring an end to individual acts of violence, you know, I mean, I don't think it is possible, am I wrong?
TRUMP: Well, one thing you have to do is degrade. What's happening is, they are going around and they feel emboldened and they feel wonderful and all of these young people in our country and other countries are looking up to ISIS because ISIS continues to talk to the United States, they started off in a small area that now, and 28 countries, Bill, 28 countries. Think of it. This is during Hillary Clinton's tenure, 28 countries.
And I want to tell you, that is disgraceful. So, you have to bring them down, and you have to bring them down fast. You know that the young people in our country and other countries, they are looking up to these people, they have respect for these people. It is like, let's put it this way. They are getting good public relations because it looks like they are beating the United States, certainly, like the United States can't beat them.
O'REILLY: Right. And it certainly is a psychological bar, as well as a physical war. But Western Europe hasn't really helped. Another thing that you said that was very controversial, is that you want to profile, you want to profile Arab or Muslim men. How would that work?
TRUMP: Well, we have no choice. Look, Israel doesn't. And Israel does it very successfully.
O'REILLY: They do it in the Air Force.
TRUMP: Well, they do it. They do it. And when the see somebody that they would like to talk to, that they would like to look at, that they'd like to maybe open up their satchel and take a look at what is inside, they do it. And they don't like to do it. I don't like to do it. But we have to be, you know, you have a woman who is 87 years old in a wheelchair from Sweden, and we have to look at her, if we are going to look at somebody else. It's ridiculous.
O'REILLY: So, what would you do though? Do you have a vision --
TRUMP: You want to be so political correct --
O'REILLY: Do you have a vision about how that profiling would work?
TRUMP: It works. We see somebody that we think there could be a problem at airports and other places, you talk to them, and you see what is going on.
O'REILLY: But I think they do that now.
TRUMP: We don't do that.
O'REILLY: You know, look, the alleged bomber here in New York lived over a chicken stand his father owns in New Jersey. I mean, come on.
TRUMP: One thing I will say, I mean, I think they have gained great respect for ISIS and the leaders of ISIS. And you see it all the time. And they are becoming, they are being radicalized.
O'REILLY: One of the things that you are going to have to do to make America great again as restore respect for the country, both overseas, and here in America. You would agree with that, correct?
TRUMP: I agree. Yes. Hundred percent.
O'REILLY: Collin Kaepernick said, another bad thing about his country, he said come about stuff about you. You did on a professional football team, what would you do with Collin Kaepernick?
TRUMP: He is making a tremendous amount of money, he is leading the American dream, he is trying to make a point. But I don't think he is making it the correct way. Personally, if it was me, I would not be happy if I were the team owner. And I don't think I am going to tell you what I would do.
O'REILLY: Would you fire him?
TRUMP: I would be happy to pay him all of this money, and I think what he is doing is very bad for the spirit of the country. At the same time, he hasn't the right to protest.
O'REILLY: I said that you are going to build -- in my opinion of course, you are going to build a wall. And I think there is no question of that. That you are going to come down hard on sanctuary cities, criminal aliens, aliens who are here illegally, who commit crimes in the USA, you will immediately deport them. You're going to have some static and the court system because of due process, but certainly, you will authorize the authorities to do that. Am I accurate so far?
TRUMP: And we will pass Kate's Law.
O'REILLY: And Kate's Law. Very important. And I know you have been behind that from the very beginning. The issue you are apparently modifying is what we talked about and I told you very rudely, I was rude, that there is no way you are going to be able to deport 12 million law- abiding, peaceful illegal aliens in the system that we have. There is too much due process involved. You're not going to be able to get an immigration force at that kind, dragging them out of their homes. So, it looks like you're modifying that, am I correct there?
TRUMP: I never talked about dragging people out of their homes, Bill. I never talked about that. Look, I mean, just so you understand, we will going to have a very strong border, people are going to come into our country, but they'll going to come in illegally. But we're going to have the wall. We're going to have -- by the way, Mexico is going to pay for the wall, 100 percent. We're going to have a wall, Mexico is going to pay for the wall, we will have a strong border, I am going to authorize, get rid of all the drug lords and the gang members in all of the people that are here illegally that shouldn't be in committing tremendous crimes.
O'REILLY: Yes. But there is due process.
TRUMP: Unbelievable crimes.
O'REILLY: You can just do an executive order.
TRUMP: Very little due process.
O'REILLY: No, but there's some.
TRUMP: Well, I think there is very little. Okay. But I think there is very little. The local police know who all of them are and we are going to get them. So, we are going to stabilize the border, we will going to have a strong border, we will have a country again. And then what is going to happen is, when it is all completed, the wall, all of this is completed, the people that haven't committed a crime, other than of course coming into the country illegally --
O'REILLY: Sure.
TRUMP: -- which is, you know, depending on your definition, those people, Bill, we are going to determine, when we look at where the country is, how the border is, what is happening with our country, which will be down the road, we're going to make a determination at that time.
O'REILLY: Okay. That's a modification of your original position. But that's fine.
TRUMP: Depending on how you want to view it.
O'REILLY: Okay. Sure. Sure.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
O'REILLY: Next up, our national security, Edward Snowden, an award-winning director, Oliver Stone.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: How about questioning the liberal media. You are spying into what they are trying to say.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: May be I am. If my side is right.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: That is funny, because my side is right.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
O'REILLY: Right back with it.
O'REILLY: Welcome back to our special edition of THE FACTOR. Big interviews, big issues. Controversial Hollywood Director Oliver Stone stopped by recently to discuss his movie about NSA leaker Edward Snowden and the growing debate over the balance between national security and individual privacy.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: How is this all possible?
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: A few words --
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Attach, takeout, Bush. So, think of it as a Google search, except instead of searching on the way people make public, we are looking at everything they don't. So, emails, chats, SMS, whatever.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes. But which people?
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: There is no way.
O'REILLY: With us now, the director of the film, the legendary, Oliver Stone. I didn't get to see the movie but I send my producers out. Before we get into it, I want to know about you. Do you see the USA is a noble country?
OLIVER STONE, DIRECTOR, ""SNOWDEN MOVIE"": Yes. In its intentions, yes. I admire its history, much of it. And I love, I grew up here. You know? I was a New York boy. My father was a strong Republican, he voted, Eisenhower was his man. And he wasn't so happy when I went to Vietnam as an infantrymen. I mean, he didn't see the need for me to go. But my father was -- I admired him very much.
O'REILLY: All right. So, basically, you were brought up in a traditional home, and you say now that you admire your country. Politically, you would say you are left, right? Little sympathetic to the Castro brothers in Cuba, Bernie Sanders supporter, so you'd be in the left-wing category?
STONE: You could say that.
O'REILLY: Okay. Now, when you produce a movie like the ""Snowden"" film, you know that there is a lot of politics just in the film itself.
STONE: Yes.
O'REILLY: All right. So, what did you want to get across in the movie?
STONE: I stay away from the politics. I really tried to stick to my role as a dramatist, that is what I do. You know, I did a movie about Nixon, I did a movie about Bush. In many cases, I was less so because I was about the assassination, the investigation.
O'REILLY: Right.
STONE: But Nixon, they thought I was too empathetic to him. And as with Bush, I felt strongly that, you know, I was criticized by the left for not making it more demonic. So, there are two rolls here, me as a citizen talking, speaking out to you, and there is me as a dramatist, telling a story.
O'REILLY: But can't you, can you, I should say, as a director, and you have a script to work with, obviously, you like the script, in this case, my producer reports, this film is sympathetic to Snowden. It is sympathetic.
STONE: Empathetic. Empathetic.
O'REILLY: All right. Empathetic. You know me, I'm not that well educated with words. But it makes him look good, right? In totality?
STONE: It is for you to judge. When you see the movie, you come out, you know, it is not trying to lead you, I'm trying to lay out the story that happened.
O'REILLY: But surely, you know that there is emotion attached to Snowden.
STONE: Yes.
O'REILLY: All right. And how he is portrayed by you, the director, is going to influence how people either like or don't like the movie. I want to get your reaction from this clip by the President about Snowden. Go.
PRES. BARACK OBAMA (D), UNITED STATES: The way in which these disclosures happened have been -- have been damaging to the United States. And damaging to our intelligence capabilities. And I think that there was a way for us to have this conversation without that damage.
O'REILLY: Okay. So, not a conservative man, a liberal man. Barack Obama. How do you react to what he said?
STONE: Well, he is also said the opposite. He said that it's brought up the conversation and the need for reform has to be discussed. And he, in fact, endorsed the Freedom Act, which was passed in 2015, which, although, you know, some people criticized it as being too moderate, but it was voted on by 200 Republicans, more or less in the House. Thirty five Republicans in the Senate.
O'REILLY: I think most Americans want more security. But at the same time, they don't want individuals like Snowden to go out with national security, that could cause people's lives. And we have seen this on a number of levels. But I would want you to react to President Obama, you have to take him at his word that he didn't think that Snowden's actions were good for the country. How do you react to that?
STONE: Well, I mean, we show in the movie his 2008 election at the promises he made for reform and transparency. And part of the problem for Snowden was that he didn't keep to those words.
O'REILLY: So, you say Obama -- go
STONE: He double done on the Bush administration's surveillance, and other forms of warfare that they created.
O'REILLY: Isn't possible that President Obama and President Bush know more about protecting Americans than Edward Snowden?
STONE: I've heard that ever since I was a young boy.
O'REILLY: You don't believe that?
STONE: No, I believe governments lie. I think that they protect their own interest.
O'REILLY: But what is the interest though, it seems to me that the interest of electronic surveillance and all of the things that you deal with you and Snowden dealt with is to protect Americans from ISIS.
STONE: Well, that is what they tell us. That is what they tell us.
O'REILLY: You don't believe that?
STONE: No, no. I think cyber warfare, we initiated it, we took a global initiative in 2007, and we used it against Iran secretly. And even, it is still classified, and we haven't admitted to it. But that virus got out in the world, it went through around, went to other countries like Jordan. And it went on and on. I talked to the guy who saw the virus, he says it took seven, eight months to find out what it was.
O'REILLY: I can speak to that --
STONE: The point being, we started a form of warfare like, this is very serious, because it has gone on and on and on, now, people are very smart. There is no secret to it, they picked up how to hack us.
O'REILLY: Do you believe, though, this is being done, and you had some questions about the 9/11 attack, I remember. Right.
STONE: I do. I was questioning what the NSA and the CIA were doing to really protect us, as you say. I don't think they did a very good job.
O'REILLY: But you don't think it's a conspiracy?
STONE: No. I didn't say that. I say that Michael Hayden has fumbled the ball.
O'REILLY: Okay. But that put you on the other side of the issue, then. If you want the protection of agencies, they have to have some, you know, a blanket of ability to tap and to look.
STONE: Selective targets.
O'REILLY: Yes.
STONE: And we have plenty of them. But why tap everybody?
O'REILLY: Well, they don't tap everybody, that there are codes that they used in the NSA to, when they're here to go in. But anyway --
STONE: Yes. I noticed you made that point but they do go back. They have a database. They can go back on anybody and find out all they want to know.
O'REILLY: All right. But you don't think that this country is actively trying to persecute its own people for these devices, do you?
STONE: No, no, no, I don't think so.
O'REILLY: All right.
STONE: But they do have an invasive ability beyond all measure, supported by a technological machine that is incredible.
O'REILLY: And then we saw that with the Russian hackers coming right in.
STONE: No, we don't know about the Russian hackers.
O'REILLY: Snowden told me they were. No, he didn't, that's a joke. That's a joke.
Coming up, Ronald Reagan and the actor who portrays him, Tim Matheson talks about playing the role of our 40th president in ""Killing Reagan.""
Reagan really was the foundation that the country needed to pull it together. And I was really moved by that.
Back in a moment.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
O'REILLY: Continuing now with the special addiction of THE FACTOR. President Reagan came into office with the goal of turning our country around after the disastrous presidency of Jimmy Carter before him. Reagan needed to be strong and determined. What I wrote my book, ""Killing Reagan,"" I portrayed much of the Presidents drive. I recently talked with Dr. Tim Matheson, who played Ronald Reagan, the 40th president, and a Nat GEO film, ""Killing Reagan.""
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Why would I risk losing everything if I can get 75 percent of what I want?
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The last time I checked, I am in control here.
O'REILLY: So, did you know a lot about Ronald Reagan when he was in office?
Tim Matheson: You know, I was politically minded. I must say, he won me over. And he is the only Republican I ever voted for.
O'REILLY: As president?
MATHESON: Yes.
O'REILLY: So, you are a liberal minded guy?
MATHESON: Yes.
O'REILLY: And most of Hollywood obviously is. But pinheads I think as you call it. Some of them are pinheads, some of them aren't. We don't mind if you are liberal, as long as you are a thinking liberal. Because I am independent. And I vote for some Democrats if I think they are the best problem solvers. Now, what did Reagan do to win you over?
MATHESON: Reagan was the tonic this country needed at the time, it was such a financial mess, such an emotional mess, that just because Nixon and all the things, and Carter was a lovely man but not a great president.
O'REILLY: But you voted for carter.
MATHESON: I did. I did. I made that mistake. I wouldn't have done it again. And I must say that Reagan really was the foundation the country needed to pull it together, and I was really moved by that.
O'REILLY: Okay. So, you saw how he performed that? For years, and that is what we want, open mindedness.
MATHESON: Yes.
O'REILLY: When he was shot, do you remember that?
MATHESON: I was surprised at how moved and upset I was because it was like her your grandfather, you know?
O'REILLY: Right.
MATHESON: And it was like, why?
O'REILLY: And you didn't know whether he was going to live.
MATHESON: No.
O'REILLY: I mean, he went in and the news reports were almost blacked out. The kid who plays Hinckley who really likes out. Just like the kid who played Oswald in ""Killing Kennedy,"" I don't know this kid is a young actor, this spooky.
MATHESON: Yes.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I have got to do something now to make you understand in no uncertain terms that I am doing all of this for your sake.
MATHESON: And being around Kyle Mora and you know, Rod Roley (ph) kept us apart. He kept Kyle isolated as Hinckley throughout the whole movie.
O'REILLY: Is that right?
MATHESON: No actors talk to him.
O'REILLY: Now, the real John Hinckley is running around Williamsburg, Virginia.
MATHESON: I know.
O'REILLY: He is out. When you accepted this role to play the president, all right, what was the hardest thing about it?
MATHESON: Not to be trapped by worrying about her sounding and moving like Reagan. I mean, I have to do that, you have to do that in part, but I wanted to explore the emotional and the heart of the man. And that was the most important thing to me.
O'REILLY: Did you watch a lot of tape of him?
MATHESON: Everything I could find.
O'REILLY: Because you do sound a bit like him.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It is a bargaining chip and you are just giving it away.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I don't see it that way.
O'REILLY: Reagan was a very close guy.
MATHESON: He is shy.
O'REILLY: Yes. He didn't like to show a lot to anybody. But Nancy, so you had a connect with the actors playing this. Cynthia Nixon. How was that?
MATHESON: She -- not hard at all.
O'REILLY: No?
MATHESON: She is wonderful. She is a wonderful actor. She is an intense listener. So, if I change the tone or the inflection of a response or a line to her, I ping she pongs, you know, she is really remarkable.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I think you are more nervous than I am.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Break a leg.
O'REILLY: I think viewers are going to be surprised because it isn't -- you are not watching Cynthia Nixon after a while, you are watching Nancy Reagan. Same thing with the president.
MATHESON: Thank you. I think she did an excellent job. And it is a less sympathetic role. And she was the bad cop to Reagan's good cop, you know.
O'REILLY: Right.
MATHESON: And she gave that to him. She took care of him. And if she didn't like the way somebody was treating him or acting around him.
O'REILLY: Oh! Ronald Reagan.
MATHESON: Gone.
O'REILLY: Yes.
MATHESON: Gone.
O'REILLY: Now, when your Hollywood pals, your liberal pals, you guys are all sitting around smoking pot, you know, and doing what you did, I am going to do ""Killing Reagan"" written by O'Reilly. Do the crosses come out? Do they go like this? Come on! Tell me the truth.
I am wearing garlic now come as a matter of fact. I mean, did you get any jazz?
MATHESON: Not at all. Not at all. I mean, if anybody did, I just said, you can't act politics. This is not about politics.
O'REILLY: A good story, right?
MATHESON: It's a great story.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Honey, they're coming at you with too much.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I am nervous.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Are you?
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I am crazy if I wasn't. But I want to do this. I mean, I can do this.
MATHESON: You know what, you know him, and have worked with him is Tom Hanks.
O'REILLY: Yes.
MATHESON: And Tom, when I told Tom I was doing this, he remarked how wonderful the projects were. You know, he worked on ""Killing Lincoln.""
O'REILLY: Yes. He was supportive.
MATHESON: Very supportive.
O'REILLY: But you know, Hanks is a diabolical man because what he says --
(LAUGHTER)
What he said, he said, I will show up on ""Killing Lincoln."" Matheson will show up on ""Killing Reagan."" So, O'Reilly doesn't screw it up. That will infiltrate and make sure the project is awesome and not some crazy right wing thing. You did a great job, Tim. And you know --
MATHESON: Thank you.
O'REILLY: I was very pleased when I hired you. But then, you know, you won me over. And I hope you and Miss Nixon get nominated for Emmy's because you really deserved it. You really do.
MATHESON: Thank you very much.
O'REILLY: All right.
MATHESON: It's fantastic.
Next up, Robert F. Kennedy believes his cousin Michael Skakel is innocent of murder. He was convicted decades ago. But is he not guilty?
And then, football legend Joe Namath speaks about head injuries and what happens to him.
O'REILLY: You had to get out of your economic circumstance through sports. So, you paid a price but the price was worth it?
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: To me, it was worth it. But there were those fellows that I played with it that I question, is it worth it to them.
O'REILLY: Right back with it.
KELLY WRIGHT, FOX NEWS HOST: Live from America's News Headquarters, I'm Kelly Wright. Good evening. Here is what's happening.
The manhunt for the Turkey nightclub attacker, taking place in an Istanbul neighborhood right now, police are there, acting on a tip. Law enforcement raided an apartment but so far there are no reports of any arrest. Earlier today, a Turkish official said they have the gunman's fingerprints. He is suspected of opening fire inside the nightclub on New Year's Eve, killing 39 people. He managed to slip from the scene by taking advantage of the chaos that ensued.
Severe weather, including thunderstorms and tornadoes, sweeping across the south. This storm system, which bonded Texas, bringing heavy flooding to Alabama. It is also knocked out power to more than 80,000 customers in Louisiana and Mississippi. Some buildings have been damaged but there are no reports of any injuries or deaths. That's a look at news this hour.
I'm Kelly Wright in Washington. Back now to THE O'REILLY FACTOR.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
O'REILLY: Justice in America. You may remember the case of Michael Skakel. Convicted of murder, sentenced of 20 years to life in Connecticut. 2013, after serving 11 years in prison, Mr. Skakel was awarded a new trial by a Connecticut judge. Case is sensational because Skakel is part of the Kennedy family. His cousin, Robert Kennedy, Jr., has written a new book called ""Framed: Why Michael Skakel Spent Over A Decade in Prison For A Murder He Did Not Commit."" The book says, Skakel is completely innocent.
So, I don't want to adjudicate the case on television. We don't have time. It's not fair to the prosecution. But I do want to get into the fact that the Connecticut Supreme Court will make a decision on whether there is a new trial for Michael Skakel any time now. Right? Do you have any heads up on that?
ROBERT KENNEDY, JR., AUTHOR, ""FRAMED"": No, it could be as long as a year, it could be two weeks.
O'REILLY: All right. So, you don't know. They will be the tail. Now, if they say, no new trial, then, Skakel goes back.
KENNEDY: He would go back.
O'REILLY: Yes.
KENNEDY: Michael served 11 and a half years of a 25 to life sentence.
O'REILLY: Uh-hm.
KENNEDY: If they overrule that, Michael goes back to jail, if they uphold it, then the prosecutor has to decide whether to retrial or to try the guys that I found who the real killers.
O'REILLY: Right. Now what I find fascinating about your book was that you and your cousin Michael Skakel weren't exactly friends when this whole thing went down. Is that correct?
KENNEDY: We were friends in the early '80s. We were very close. We both got sober at the same time. But our friendship deteriorated and we were estranged during his trial. It really wasn't until this January that we reconciled. But I wrote the book, even though, you know, Michael was not speaking to me, I knew that he was innocent.
O'REILLY: Yes. You, from the jump, were on his side and proclaiming his innocence. Why was he angry with you?
KENNEDY: You know, he went through, as I show on in the book, he went through a really difficult life. And he was put in this very brutal reform school. Where he was tortured every day for two years. Eleven years of prison. And then before that, he had a very tough time. So, he has been a very acute case of post-traumatic stress syndrome. And when Mark Fuhrman began attacking him and the path that would later put Michael in prison, he thought that, you know, the reason that he was being attacked was because this association with the Kennedy family. As I show on the book, there was no relationship between the Kennedys --
O'REILLY: Right. Right. So, it was a rational thing opinion that he had. And he got mad at you. But the reason that I gave you that blurb that is on the cover of the book was because I admire your loyalty to a man who wasn't real fond of you at the time. And so, you said, I'm going to but all the personal stuff aside, I don't think most people would have done that. And I'm going to try to seek justice. And I believe you are trying to seek justice now. Whether you are right or wrong, I don't know. I don't know. That is why I say, you should read the book, you should listen to what the prosecution has to say, and we will see what the Supreme Court has to say. But your loyalty to the man is very, very unique, I think.
KENNEDY: Well, you know, loyalty could cut both ways. And a lot of people have accused family members, Skakel family members, of being loyal to the extent of covering up a murder, which, you know, none of those Skakels has the kind of moral bankruptcy to do that kind of thing. You know, I saw somebody who I knew was innocent and, you know, it's like, if you witness a mugging on the street, you have to make a choice as to whether or not to get involved or put your head down and keep walking.
O'REILLY: Right.
KENNEDY: I saw a guy put in jail for life for a crime he did not commit. And you know, I felt like I had no choice but to do what I did.
O'REILLY: All right. Mr. Kennedy, thank you very much for coming in.
KENNEDY: Thank you so much.
O'REILLY: Plenty more still to come, as a special edition of THE FACTOR continues. How did Hollywood portray what was behind the great recession of 2008?
KENNEDY: Cologne?
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: No.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Opportunity.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: No. Money.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Okay.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: There is no money.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Okay.
O'REILLY: I will talk with the award winning director of ""The Big Short,"" Adam McKay.
O'REILLY: ""Personal Story"" segment tonight, Hollywood and politics, the movie, ""The Big Short,"" was about to collapse of the mortgage backed securities industry that led to the great depression. Recession I guess it would be. In 2008, we are still feeling that today. I spoke with award- winning Director Adam McKay about the recession and his movie.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I want to buy swaps on mortgage bonds, it will pay off, if the underlying bond fails --
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: You want to bet against them?
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Why? Those bonds only fail if millions of Americans don't pay their mortgages. That is never happened in history.
O'REILLY: You tried to keep politics out of the movie, I was waiting for the left left-wing spin. But there was an antigovernment message over all, correct?
ADAM MCKAY, DIRECTOR. ""THE BIG SHORT"": Well, you know, we really looked at this issue as something that goes beyond right, left wing. It obviously affected everyone, as far as the questions on the government. I mean, what we really question where the areas where the government took a lot of money from the banks. And sort of neutered itself as a regulatory body. So, yes, there were some shots of the government, there was some shots at the bank, I mean, clearly there was a giant corrupt system.
O'REILLY: There is no doubt about that. And you made the point very vividly and explained as well during the film.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Did you hear? Mortgage default has gone through the roof.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Is anybody jumping off a buildings yet?
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Why would they, subprime mortgage is up.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What?
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: 1.9 million more in collateral by close.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: He is asking us to post collateral.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What the hell is going on?
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We don't know.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: -- on the phone demanding payment.
O'REILLY: Now, you, yourself, you are a liberal guy, right?
MCKAY: I guess, technically, you would call me a liberal guy, although, I am just against corruption, I am against our government being bought and paid for.
O'REILLY: A lot of Americans are distrustful of the federal government and they are also distrustful of left-wing, right-wing, depending on where you are. So, there really isn't any trust at all in the country right now, is there?
MCKAY: You know, I have always thought the answer is really simple. If you have a representative and they are taking a lot of money from the banks or oil companies or billionaires, don't vote for them. Because if they are taking that money, you know for a fact, they're going to vote in support of those people.
O'REILLY: Rather than you. And you make a point in ""The Big Short"" that the folks ultimately had to bail out all of these big broker -- that made the court deal, which is true.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What is that?
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What?
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What's the smell? The cologne?
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: No.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Opportunity.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: No.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Money.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: There is no money.
O'REILLY: One of the movies of yours that you made that I like best is ""Anchorman,"" because I sought the main character, Will Ferrell ripped me off, although I have a much better physique than he does.
WILL FERRELL, ACTOR: Watch out for the guns. They'll get you.
O'REILLY: What were you trying to get across here? Those movies really did well.
MCKAY: You know, I think most of all, Will and I loved to laugh. They are clearly silly, absurdist comedies. But I think it was also a little bit of a poke at how ratings driven the news has become, how profit driven has become.
FERRELL: What you are about to see is a Channel 4 news exclusive. His name is not to you the squirrel and he is three years old.
How about that?
(LAUGHTER)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes. That's hilarious.
MCKAY: But most of all, we wanted to make people laugh. And we were poking fun at the perfect hairdos of the anchors and the perfect ties. But yes, you know, I mean, it is definitely a comedy with a little bit of a job at the for-profit news.
O'REILLY: Yes. The shallow news people.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: He had a voice that could make -- and find they make Sinatra look like a hobo.
O'REILLY: But I'm telling you, I should have done a cameo. I know Will Ferrell is a big FACTOR fan. You know, he's text me all the time. You know, Bill, you right on. I love the talking points. I love the tip of the day. So, you know, the next time you are making ""Anchorman 3,"" I expect to be on that set. Because Mr. McKay, if you want to shallow, here I am. Right? I am the shoals.
MCKAY: God bless you, sir.
O'REILLY: Okay. All right.
MCKAY: We appreciate it and you will be called the next time.
O'REILLY: Thank you.
When we get back, football icon Joe Namath talks about the dangers of head injuries and the game.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I did go get checked because I knew I had at least five concussions. I had a lot of sales that weren't working in the temporal area and the left side of my brain.
O'REILLY: Back in a moment.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
O'REILLY: Thanks for staying with us. I am Bill O'Reilly in the second ""Personal Story"" segment tonight. Head injuries in the National Football League. Football legend Joe Namath has had a few of himself, but through treatment with hyperbaric chamber therapy, he feels today like a new man. We spoke with him about that as well as his prestigious career.
Now, I am a big jets fan, and I lived in Levittown right near where you guys trained at Hofstra. On Long Island. And back then, it seems to me, that it was much more dangerous to be a quarterback. Then it is today.
JOE NAMATH, FORMER NFL STAR: Bill, it was. Anybody that was in the hole or the pocket was going to get hurt because we didn't have the kind of protection they have today. The game has improved in that category. I think we are trying to protect all of the players more so than yesteryear.
O'REILLY: Yes. Because there is big money with these quarterbacks. But back then, guys like Ben David, an Oakland Raiders, they wanted to rip your head off and kill you, am I wrong?
NAMATH: God rest his soul, Mr. Al Davis had the theory with that Oakland Raiders and didn't mind talking about it as a team.
O'REILLY: Yes. They smash you as hard as they could smash you, and then, they say something nasty to you. Right?
NAMATH: Oh, I know what they've said to us, we said right back, some of them talked about their own, too.
O'REILLY: The results of all that was, and you are 72 years old now, but injuries to you throughout your whole life. Ken Stabler, who followed you at Alabama, his family just announced that he had brain disease that he got hit in the head so many times. But you seem, your mental faculties, seem to be intact.
NAMATH: I did go get checked because I knew I had at least five concussions. This was 2012, I started.
O'REILLY: So, you have a little bit of damage but not enough to impair you?
NAMATH: I had a lot of a sales that weren't working in the temporal area on the left side of my brain that are not functioning because of a treatment I took with hyperbaric oxygen prayed
O'REILLY: You had to get out of your economic circumstance through sports. I mean, you had to play.
NAMATH: Right.
O'REILLY: If you wanted to leave Beaver Falls, Pennsylvania --
NAMATH: Right.
O'REILLY: -- and go to college and all of that.
NAMATH: Absolutely.
O'REILLY: So, you paid a price but the price was worth it, was at?
NAMATH: To me, it was worth it. To this stage, absolutely it was worth it. But there are those fellows that I played with that I question, is it worth it to them.
O'REILLY: Now, you were loved and hated. Okay? Especially, because you are a little flamboyant, I would say, right?
NAMATH: You know what --
O'REILLY: A little bit.
NAMATH: You don't like to be told you can't do something, and we all like to stand out a little bit.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: But doing this can make my legs look good, imagine what they will do for yours.
O'REILLY: But you were Broadway Joe and you are cocky and I have to confess, when I played at -- I wore white shoes. So my question is, today, Cam Newton, all right? Is now being charged as a hot shot because he does the little dance in the end zone, which I enjoy. All right? But you went through this.
NAMATH: When it comes to sports, winning is the answer. Now, if you are going out and carrying on, showboating, dancing around, and you are not winning, your teammates will knock you down. They are not going to put up with that.
O'REILLY: Was their racism in football when you were there? You played with a lot of great black players. Emerson Boozer, Matt Snow, I mean -- was there racism?
NAMATH: Yes, there has always been racism. There is racism then and there is racism today, and we both know that it is not the right way to live. Hatred and anger is not healthy. But we have come a long way.
O'REILLY: But you and I don't know how people know this, but Namath stuck up for the black players.
NAMATH: Both of my parents taught us that is the family, and most of the people to this day, they carry a chip on their shoulder whenever they are starting to judge people by their color, by their walk, whatever, ethnicity, that is ingrained from home to start with.
O'REILLY: Yes. You had worked out, like now, they are just work out warriors, these guys are around, you know? To put it politely, you didn't really work out that much, other than your elbow coming up to her mouth on certain occasions.
NAMATH: Whether some other kinds of things, too.
O'REILLY: Okay. So, see, that work out is also controversial. But my question is, if you had worked out, if you had been, you know, like they are now, these guys are unbelievable, the machines. Would that have helped physically, do you think?
NAMATH: I know it would've helped, sure. That is one of the major steps forward today with the sports. The nutrition aspect alone.
O'REILLY: Yes.
NAMATH: So, yes, today's methods are much better and they should be.
O'REILLY: Did you ever think that if you had been like a workout warrior and not been Broadway Joe which is true for more than 4000 yards in a season, and you were out until like six in the morning, you just go from the party to the game, I mean, it's amazing what you did.
NAMATH: We did all right.
(LAUGHTER)
I wouldn't change my ways. I wouldn't change my ways.
O'REILLY: Are you sure?
NAMATH: To some extent.
(LAUGHTER)
O'REILLY: Joe Namath, thanks for coming in.
NAMATH: Thank you, Bill.
Next up, Beach Boys legend my glove talks about drugs, Charles Manson, and overcoming all of it to become one of America's greatest bands ever.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
O'REILLY: ""Back of the Book"" segment tonight, the legendary pop group, the Beach Boys, over the years, they have had more top 40 hits than any other American group in history. Beach Boys still tour and the lead singer, Mike Love, has written a new book called ""Good Vibrations,"" that chronicles what happened to the band. Some of it is surprising.
So, first of all, you know, I'm a big Beach Boys fan, have been since I was like six years old. That is how much older you are than me.
(LAUGHTER)
And when I read your book, though, there were a lot of things that I didn't know about the band that you write about. The first when I want to get into is, it seems like every single American rock band was destroyed by drugs. And the Beach Boys, no exception. Brian Wilson got heavily into drugs, and so did all the other members, and some of it was heroin. Big time drugs. Why does that happen?
MIKE LOVE, CO-FOUNDER OF THE BEACH BOYS: You know, back in the '60s, you know, marijuana was no big thing. But then, along comes LSD. And that really messed some people's brains up.
O'REILLY: Did you ever take LSD?
LOVE: No. Absolutely not.
O'REILLY: But your cousin, Brian Wilson did.
LOVE: And Dennis and Carl.
O'REILLY: Did that change them?
LOVE: My cousin Brian said, once he took LSD, he's heard voices saying derogatory thing to him since that time he took LSD. So, in that specific situation, it didn't do Brian any favors.
O'REILLY: So, you started off as clean-cut kids from Hawthorne, California, making a great new sound. And then, all of a sudden, a few years later, you are dropping balls. Now the other thing was, that you along the line, you got to meet all the big rock icons. And tell the story about meeting the Beatles and the book. Did you get along with those guys?
LOVE: Yes. Beautifully. Harrison and I both had our birthdays in 1968 and George passed away, I was feeling very melancholy about it because he is such a great person. Paul McCartney came to the breakfast table one morning playing, listen to this, Mike, Oh, flew in from Miami Beach B.O.A.C.
O'REILLY: ""Back in the USSR.""
LOVE: ""Back in the USSR.""
O'REILLY: Why do you think they were so successful? Did you ever think about that?
LOVE: They were brilliant at marketing and promotion. ""Sergeant Pepper's"" album cover, right? Was brilliant.
O'REILLY: Sure.
LOVE: That is Paul McCartney. Our album cover ""Pet Sounds"" was photographed at the San Diego petting zoo.
(LAUGHTER)
O'REILLY: Yes. You have to give it to the Beatles. Because I don't think any phenomenon, I think the Beach Boys are probably the best American group ever. You, and your book, get kind of dark, and the darkest part, Dennis Wilson gets involved with Charles Manson. When you first heard about that, did you have any idea how bad this Manson was?
LOVE: Oh, no. Nobody did. We knew he was weird. Dennis comes home from a tour we had been on, and Charlie and the girls were living at his house.
O'REILLY: They moved into Dennis Wilson's house?
LOVE: They moved in. They moved in and they took cars, clothing, anything that wasn't nailed down.
O'REILLY: Did Dennis Wilson think he was strange?
LOVE: Well, let's put it this way. Why are you so uptight today, Dennis. Well, I was out of the ranch, and I saw Charlie taking M-16 rifle and throw a black cat, meaning an African-American guy, a black cat and half and stop him down a well at the ranch.
O'REILLY: He killed the guy?
LOVE: Yes.
O'REILLY: Did you believe that story?
LOVE: That is what I was told by Dennis.
O'REILLY: The other chilling part is Susan Atkins, one of the Manson killers, babysat your kids.
LOVE: Yes, that's right.
O'REILLY: But you didn't know at the time that Susan Atkins was a killer.
LOVE: No, no, no, no, no, no. That all became revealed after.
O'REILLY: After. Did it ever occur to you, when you were 21, 22-year-old guy, coming up with a span, and you are making a lot of people happy, that a 75, you would be saying the words --
(MUSIC PLAYING)
Actually, Bill, no.
(LAUGHTER)
But you are 75 years old, what you'd do? A hundred and seventy five shows?
LOVE: Hundred and seventy two.
O'REILLY: I am sorry.
LOVE: I was saying 75 but then --
O'REILLY: Hundred and seventy two shows the Beach Boys did in 2015.
LOVE: Right. Correct.
O'REILLY: And you guys, why did you do it?
LOVE: You know, you are a Beach Boy fan. You see the audience response.
O'REILLY: Yes.
(MUSIC PLAYING)
So, because they are happy, that makes you happy and that is why you did it?
LOVE: Yes, I was one of the co-creators of the music, and to see that kind of response and how much happiness is generated and an evening's performance is a wonderful thing.
(MUSIC PLAYING)
O'REILLY: Mike Love, everybody, the book is ""Good Vibrations.""
LOVE: Thank you. Thank you, Bill.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
O'REILLY: And that is it for us tonight. I want to thank you for watching the special edition of THE FACTOR. I am Bill O'Reilly. And please always remember, that the spin stops here. Because we are definitely looking out for you."
0	64	 65 von 72	Fox News Network	January 2, 2017 Monday	 TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT	 7:00 PM EST		"TUCKER CARLSON, FOX NEWS HOST: Good evening and welcome to ""Tucker Carlson Tonight.""
In just two days, newly selected White House press secretary Sean Spicer will travel west to speak at the University of Chicago, one of this nation's most prestigious and expensive colleges. He's coming at the invitation of long-time Obama aide David Axelrod, the topic of course is politics and the presidential campaign. But not everyone on campus believes Spicer should be allowed to talk in public. They argue that by inviting a Trump supporter to campus, the school's, quote, ""normalizing the incoming administration.""
Some students are threatening to shut down the event entirely. One of those joins us now.
He is University of Chicago senior Jake Bittle. He is also an editor of the local weekly paper. 
Jake, thanks for coming on tonight.
JAKE BITTLE, ENGLISH MAJOR, UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO: Thanks for having me, Tucker.
CARLSON: I like your tie.
BITTLE: Thanks.
CARLSON: So you have -- you wrote on Facebook that you want to shut this thing down, and you suggested projectile vomiting, during the event, which I assume was a joke.
But the idea was that this guy, Sean Spicer should not be allowed to speak. And I read a lot of what you wrote about it. And one of your explanations was, well, he represents a press operation that is hostile to freedom of speech and to the freedom of the press. Therefore, he shouldn't be allowed to talk. There seems an irony in that. He is against freedom of speech, so don't let him talk? How does that work?
BITTLE: Sure. So what I was saying was not that he shouldn't be allowed to talk, rather, what I was saying was, I, as a student -- and yes, it was a joke when I said that. I wouldn't projectile vomit on him. Although, I'm glad that I made it, because now I get to explain what I meant to you.
So what I meant was that I am a student and my peers should be allowed to respond to his presence on my campus, in ways that aren't just civil or decorate and don't involve just sort of standing up after the event and asking him a question. Oh I never said he should be disinvited. I never said he shouldn't be allowed to talk.
CARLSON: But in ways that involve force? I mean, it sounds like. So when you say, we should be allowed to respond, how about the traditional path, which is to make a counter case. You disagree with what he stands for, which is of course fine, and you say, this is what I stand for and may the best man win. You don't believe in that, it seems like.
BITTLE: Sure. So Sean Spicer was hired and was paid to have certain opinions and to support certain policies about the pres. He has power, a national platform. He's in the news every day. And he has access to policymaking power.
If I stand up and ask him a question and say, Sean, have you ever considered that you might be fascist, he could give me a smarmy answer, it'll last 20 seconds and I don't get a follow up, and then, what do I do?
I'm saying I would like to raise this ability and voice my frustration with this person in ways that aren't sort of going to die after 20 seconds and he gives me, you know, sort of a non-answer.
He's a spin doctor, I mean, you know.
(CROSSTALK)
CARLSON: But that's a -- but that's a stupid question, though. Why are you a fascist? I mean, I'm not even sure we can agree on what that means.
BITTLE: Yes, that was -- yes, OK.
(CROSSTALK)
CARLSON: How about -- how about specific, like you believe this, you are in favor of this policy, here is why I think it's wrong or hurts America. Make your case. And in all the social media endorser who write today, I haven't seen you doing that. Instead -- and you are clearly smart. I've seen you calling names, which seems to be kind of the way people respond now. Wouldn't it be better to make a case?
BITTLE: Sure. I mean, I think that no matter what kind of case I make, and no matter how good of a point I make to him, he has no reason to listen to me and no incentive to listen to me.
I mean, this isn't about who is right. It's about who has power. And so, I think that students in this country need to mobilize in ways that would actually get people that we like in office, instead of sort of discussing and sanitizing environments in -- you know, in moderated conversations. Does that make sense?
CARLSON: It sort of does. And just to help you elucidate it more, I want to put on the screen something that you wrote in your school newspaper recently.
BITTLE: Sure.
CARLSON: An independent school newspaper. You said this, ""Now, we are faced with a real crisis."" This being the election of Trump.
""We must take real action and dispense with all this sophistry, all these abstract notions of civility, which are just Ivy League translation of the vulgar ""give Trump a chance."" By ""real action"" I mean donating money to the ACLU, to Standing Rock, to Planned Parenthood, calling your representative incessantly, protesting obsessively, going to D.C. and flipping cars when Trump walks away from the Paris climate agreement, attacking racists you see attacking people in the supermarket. Whatever it takes.""
So I got a bunch of questions about this, but the first is, whose cars would you flip?
BITTLE: I don't know yet. I mean, it depends on whether or not he walks away from the Paris Climate Accords. I mean, I think that if you dwell on the sort of more exaggerated or hyperbolic parts of this article, which is, after all, just an article, you're not going to get a chance to actually ask me what I think political action constitutes. I mean, all of this is meant to express, Tucker --
(CROSSTALK)
CARLSON: Whoa, wait a second, you were just explaining what it -- I mean, first of all, let me say, having read things you've written going back to, you know, high school, because you have written a lot, you are pretty articulate person with a command of -- precise command of the language.
And presumably in an article this long, you could explain exactly what that action, what form it would take. And in this case, you said, it takes flipping cars over. And my point is someone paid for those cars. Like those aren't your cars. And to destroy other people's property to make your political point isn't really a valid path, is it?
BITTLE: Well, first of all, they flipped cars in the (INAUDIBLE). But, secondly, Tucker, I mean, so -- I think that -- yes, it's an article, and I exaggerated. But I mean, I'm trying to explain now what I think I actually mean by political action that doesn't consist and sort of sanitize or moderated Q&A sessions or bipartisan roundtables at the institute of politics.
And I think that you want to say that this way of engaging in politics is a sort of young, petulant thing among close minded liberals, but really, the sort of ancestry of this kind of action is the tea party.
I mean, they staged massive demonstrations, they called their representatives incessantly, and they got people that they wanted in office, through a grassroots mobilization.
CARLSON: Right.
BITTLE: I mean, there is big money involved, but frankly, there is a lot of political participation in that. And so I don't think that it's fair to say that what I am doing is sort of a catastrophic or intolerant, when really, what I'm trying to argue is that young people need to be politically mobilizing ways that don't just involve talking and asking questions, and going back and forth.
CARLSON: And like knowing things. So, like, what about the Paris climate agreement do you like so much?
BITTLE: If America were not to participate in this Climate Accord, carbon levels would rise so much in the world that it would sort of be past the point where we can bring it back down in a safe or efficient way.
CARLSON: That suggests you know nothing about it. But let me ask you this.
BITTLE: Tucker, just because I don't have the numbers on it doesn't mean that doesn't --
(CROSSTALK)
CARLSON: No, no, no. What I'm saying, look, you're going to -- here's my point. You are the editor of a weekly paper. People listen to you, and rather than explain you know here is why you ought to support the Paris Climate Agreement, your position is, if you don't believe everything I think I believe, even if I have no details, I'm not going to flip your car over. I'm not going to vomit on you.
Do you have any idea? I'm not going to commit an act of violence. I'm not going to beat you up in a supermarket. That's not really debate. That's something dumber, no?
BITTLE: Tucker, how could I possibly make the case to the Trump administration that he ought not to walk away from the Paris Climate Accords?
CARLSON: You don't even know what it is.
(LAUGHTER)
BITTLE: How could I possibly make a point in a way that would make him want to listen to me? I mean, it's not about sort of who can make better points, and this guy has a platform. He has control of the country and can do whatever he wants, no matter what he wants.
It's not about whether I can convince him and the administration that it's wrong, it's about whether I can make sure that he feels enough pressure that he won't do it, and doomed the future of our planet.
CARLSON: So, what you are articulating isn't politics, it's nihilism. You are saying that none of this matters --
(CROSSTALK)
BITTLE: No, Tucker, that's absolutely wrong.
CARLSON: And whoever has the gun is the guy in charge. That's basically what you are saying.
BITTLE: Tucker, no, that's exactly what I am not saying. I'm saying that I have convictions and I would like to express them on terms that are not set by my opponent. Do you understand what I mean?
CARLSON: Right. I think we can all agree on these terms. Rational, elucidated fact-based debate carries the day. And if you don't agree with that, and if you think vandalism carries the day, then, we can't really have a conversation because we are just starting from places that are so different that is not even worth it, right?
BITTLE: Right. So, you want to say that I want to hear the other side out and I won't participate in a rational debate.
CARLSON: Yes.
BITTLE: But the question is how can I possibly to participate in a rational debate with someone who literally controls the country? I mean, think about this for a second.
CARLSON: I don't know. I'm sure vomiting on him isn't going to be the answer to that.
BITTLE: You establish the segment by telling me that that was a joke and I agreed with you.
(CROSSTALK)
CARLSON: I hope. Look, because I think -- look, I'm almost out of time. Let me just say this last thing. I think you are smart. You probably have valid points. Maybe I disagree with them, but it might be better to explain what they are, rather than to start with, hey, if you don't like it, I'm going to hit you in the face which is where you are starting from.
BITTLE: That's fair, Tucker, but, I mean -- I think that you have sort of skirted around what my actual point is. And, look, you have read my writings going back to high school. You should know that there's a tradition of hyperbole in writing that goes back --
(CROSSTALK)
CARLSON: No, I got that. (INAUDIBLE), but facts can't.
Jake, thanks a lot for joining us. I appreciate it.
Well, President-elect Trump is back in New York City after spending Christmas down at Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, Florida.
Correspondent Peter Doocy is live outside Trump Tower in New York City with how the transition is shaking up.
Peter?
PETER DOOCY, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Tucker, most offices here in midtown Manhattan were empty today because it's a federal holiday, but Mr. Trump is up on the 26th floor of his Manhattan skyscraper, he was working and he was tweeting, most recently, just a few minutes ago.
""China has been taking out massive amounts of money and wealth from the U.S. in totally one-sided trade, but won't help with North Korea. Nice.""
And that came just a few minutes after he tweeted about North Korea, too. He said, ""North Korea just stated that it is in the final stages of developing a nuclear weapon capable of reaching parts of the U.S. It won't happen.""
Now, he's talked a lot about China and North Korea. Not so much about crime in Chicago, which was something else that caught his attention. And he blasted this out a few hours ago.
""Chicago murder rate is record-setting, 4331 shooting victims with 761 murders in 2016. If mayor can't do it, he must ask for federal help.""
Now something that we have heard, the president-elect talk a lot about during the transition is his improbable come-from-behind victory, and he got on the board in 2017 with a pair of tweets about that, too.
He said, ""Various media outlets and pundits say that I thought I was going to lose the election. Wrong. It all came together in the last week, and I thought and felt I would win big, easily over the fabled 270. 306. When they canceled fireworks, they knew, and so did I.""
Now today, the transition team was also explaining what the president-elect meant on New Year's Eve when he said that on Tuesday or Wednesday of this week, the world is going to be privy to information that he knows, but we don't, to make him skeptical of Russian government interference with the U.S. election process.
Incoming press secretary Sean Spicer explained that the president-elect gets regular briefings from his national security team and others, and that is what has been informing his opinion to date.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
SEAN SPICER, INCOMING WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: He is privy to information that nobody else is. But what I think what he is driving at is the fact that there doesn't seem to be conclusive evidence within the intelligence community. There are people who believe certain things, but what we are waiting for is this final report as to whether or not it is actually conclusive or whether or not there is just general belief that that's the direction, I think, this thing is in.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
DOOCY: The highest profile visitor here to Trump Tower today was the Vice President-elect Mike Pence. He came and went less than an hour later. It does seem like things are quieting down for the night, but we expect the president-elect to have a full schedule here at Trump Tower tomorrow.
Tucker?
CARLSON: Oh, the great Peter Doocy, stuck in New York, down at Palm Beach, but it's good to see you anyway.
While there's 18 days left in President Obama's term, but he is not wasting a single one of them. He is doing whatever he can to protect his political legacy, you remember that, the one that was soundly rejected by voters in November.
Here now to respond is David Goodfriend, an attorney and Democratic strategist who served in the long ago Bill Clinton White House, but at the Democratic Party. It was a very different place.
David, it's good to see you.
DAVID GOODFRIEND, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST: Thanks for having me on. Happy New Year, Tucker.
CARLSON: Happy New Year to you.
So I just have to ask you, I know this is not a probable scenario, but it is being batted around by the lunatics online today. That is a recess appointment of Merrick Garland of the Supreme Court. So tomorrow, Congress goes back into session and the speaker gavels it out, the end of the 114th. There's a five minute intercession between the two. The inter-session recess at it's called and then he gavels in 115.
The idea is that in that period, the president could make a recess appointment of Supreme Court justice, will he do that?
GOODFRIEND: I don't think so. But I think it's an interesting theory. It suggests that would President Obama exercise every last ounce of executive authority that he has, including during recess appointments. But I think by and large, presidents have avoided doing that for Supreme Court justice for good reason.
I mean, there is a Congressional, a Senate process for reviewing and consenting on a nominee. I think that's going to happen here.
I will say that I think it was rather pugnacious of the Senate Republicans not to even hold hearings on the president's nominee, which is just part of our constitution.
CARLSON: Yes, it was pugnacious.
GOODFRIEND: I think they should have hearings and held a vote and voted against it.
CARLSON: Yes, may be so. Maybe so. And yet, voters, with that in mind, voted for the Republican anyway and elected him president. And I guess that's the point.
So, rather than pausing in the aftermath of this kind of amazing election outcome that nobody expected, least of all President Obama, and asking, what are voters trying to tell us, he is moving forward as if the last election ratified his policies and give him another mandate.
So he has done all of these things, restricted leasing in the arctic and Atlantic Oceans, dismantled this tracking system for Muslim visitors to our country, instituted sanctions against Russia, protected a million acres of land in the western states against the will of those states. Nobody voted for any of these things.
GOODFRIEND: Well, unfortunately, Tucker, the way our constitutions works is we have one president.
CARLSON: Yes, I know. I know.
GOODFRIEND: And executive actions can be easily undone by an incoming president. It's not like you are passing a law that then has to be overturned or passed, overcome by another Congress. I think what's going on here, frankly, we have, in this country, a system of laws for getting regulations in place.
Forgive me for going all law professor on you, but I think it's really important. We have something called the Administrative Procedures Act, which is how regulations are supposedly formulated. You put something out for public comment, the public gets to comment. The agency then puts out a regulation. Lawsuits happen about that. Somebody says, well, you didn't give me enough notice. You didn't give me enough -- and that's really --
CARLSON: Well, I'm starting to get all law professor on you as a history major. But, actually, the president doesn't pass laws and neither do the courts. The Congress does.
(CROSSTALK)
You said laws, correctly, because in fact, they are laws. They are laws.
(CROSSTALK)
Where we are now, and you know it as well as I is the executive branch is making the laws and they're calling them legislation, they are ignoring Congress, which in a way of saying they are ignoring voters, they are doing what they want.
GOODFRIEND: They are acting under statutory authority. They can't go beyond statutory authority. They can get sued for that, and they have, and they won or lose. In this case, it's the president acting in his power as the executive to implement the laws.
(CROSSTALK)
CARLSON: He can do it and I can do a lot of things, but I choose not to because I restrained myself, because they are bad for me or the people around me. And shouldn't the president in the interest of democracy pull back a little bit, look at voters and say, what were you trying to say? Clearly, you didn't love Obamacare. Clearly, you didn't love my climate policy, because if you did, you would have elected my successor, Hillary Clinton.
GOODFRIEND: So if under that logic, the Republican should have held those hearings on Merrick Garland, the Supreme Court justice. They should have brought up for a vote, but they didn't. So why don't you get that message?
(CROSSTALK)
CARLSON: Well, because I think that's a fair point. I mean, I think it's a fair point. Maybe they should have done that, but I'm talking about right now, but they didn't.
GOODFRIEND: They didn't. And Barack Obama is saying, you know what, I'm still president, this is my authority, under the law --
CARLSON: Whatever I did --
(CROSSTALK)
GOODFRIEND: Whatever under the law, I am authorized --
CARLSON: OK, but, look, the president's -- what's wrong with it is, it's increasing a trend that has been going on for the last 20 years where the country is becoming less Democratic. Ordinary people have less control over what happens to them, from governments than they've ever had before because more decisions are being made by fewer people, unelected people and the agencies, the courts. It's not good. And you know it's not good and he is making it worst.
GOODFRIEND: I would say this, Tucker. The people who voted for Barack Obama in overwhelming numbers, overwhelming numbers, got a president for four years, and they got a new president in Donald Trump for the next four years, who can just as easily, under his executive authority undo whatever he wants.
CARLSON: I know. And you're right.
(CROSSTALK)
GOODFRIEND: Undo whatever he wants.
(CROSSTALK)
CARLSON: And you're absolutely right.
GOODFRIEND: We only have one president at a time. Now I will say this --
(CROSSTALK)
CARLSON: But we have a congress that is supposed to be doing this. And, basically, what Obama is doing.
GOODFRIEND: Oh, no.
CARLSON: .is by acting in an authoritarian way, he is guaranteeing that Trump will do same.
GOODFRIEND: You are misstating the law, Tucker. Congress makes the law the president enforces of. These are regulations under statutory authority. If Congress wanted to undo them, Tucker, you know very well they could pass a law to undo them. They don't.
CARLSON: Because they are cowards.
GOODFRIEND: OK.
CARLSON: Basically, that's true.
GOODFRIEND: We can agree on that.
Let's agree on that. They are coward.
CARLSON: On that, David, thank you. Good to see you.
GOODFRIEND: You, too.
CARLSON: Now it's time for ""Twitter Storm,"" our nightly forecast of social media's most powerful weather patterns.
Tonight, Mariah Carey, she's a singer and she's getting attention on Twitter thanks to her poor lip syncing on New Year's Eve. It turns out she wasn't actually singing the song. We know that because she was caught on tape apparently unable to hear the sound track. The whole embarrassing thing is everywhere. It was televised live on national TV. Twitter had a lot to say about it.
Gino said this, ""The last death of 2016, Mariah Carey's career."" Ouch!
Tony Lindsey (ph) wrote, ""Word is Russia intelligence hacked Mariah Carey's New Year's Eve performance."" Which is totally plausible, of course. That darn Putin.
Jimmy Trana (ph) said this, ""Even Milli Vanilli is embarrassed by Mariah Carey's debacle.""
Brent (ph) said ""Mariah Carey made more money mumbling and being confused on the stage for three minutes than I will make in my lifetime."" Which is probably literally true. I want that job.
Claire Banin (ph) wrote, ""Maybe Mariah Carey didn't give the performance that 2016 wanted, but she gave a performance that 2016 deserved.""
Pithy as always. That's tonight's ""Twitter Storm.""
Up next, how will our relationship with Russia evolve, change, improve, who knows what's going to happen under President Trump? That's what John Bolton has been thinking a lot about it. His ideas on that, next.
Also, where is evidence of a Russian hack? We all agreed happen, right? So where's the proof? That's coming up.
CARLSON: So I bet a year ago, you didn't think a whole lot about what Russia was up to and all of a sudden, it's on the front page of every paper, everyday.
U.S.-Russia relations now considered one of the most important issues in this country certainly when Trump becomes president later this month. They will be center stage on his plate.
Former U.S. ambassador to the U.N., Ambassador John Bolton has been thinking an awful lot about this, a relationship with Moscow. He says it may change if they have to change. He joins us now in studio.
Ambassador, great to see you.
JOHN BOLTON, FORMER UNITED STATES AMBASSADOR TO THE U.N.: Glad to be with you.
CARLSON: So you are skeptical that these sanctions are not the ones that President Obama has just imposed on Russia and your recommendations, I think I'm quoting you correctly, ""We need to make the Russians feel pain.""
What would be the point of that?
JOHN BOLTON, FORMER UNITED STATES AMBASSADOR TO THE U.N.: The point of that is to get to the place we want to be where this kind of interference and hacking, that they, the Chinese and other had been engage in isn't normal activity.
And to do that, you need structures of deterrence to tell these foreign intelligence services or their militaries that if you try and do this, it's going to cause you more trouble than you are going to get benefit from it because, otherwise, we face the prospect that this is going to continue. It's going to expand. And that's trouble for us. We are not ready for it. We don't have adequate defences; we don't have adequate offences at the moment.
CARLSON: So the North Koreans have been under in effect sanctions for 50 years, OK? And they are one of the poorest countries on the planet.
BOLTON: I'm not talking about economic sanctions.
CARLSON: No, but what's so interesting, though, is they -- like any kind of sanctions, I mean, they have place with no contact. Nobody but China, and yet they hacked, they flooded the world with methamphetamine with counterfeit hundred dollar bills and they cost a lot of mischief, even though they are a pariah. So why would it work with Russia?
BOLTON: Well, because the theory is that they need to understand that we are simply not going to sit back and allow this to happen. And, unfortunately, their experience over the past years is precisely that is what will happen. We don't see either evidence or commentary from the administration on what they have done in response, not only to earlier examples of Russian hacking, but for example China stealing what our estimated to be tens of millions of personal records from the U.S. government.
Indeed, what was leaked out of the administration was a long list of reasons why they can't make up their mind what to do. And I think when you fed what happens in cyberspace with the overall Obama worldview in foreign policy, it's an approach that very much limits the assertion of American interest. And constantly ties us down in ways that others take advantage of.
So I don't see cyber as being different from a range of other international threats that we face inadequately for eight years.
CARLSON: But, I mean, are we sure -- I mean, we know that the Russians have hacked into all kinds of systems, including the White House computer system a couple of years ago. But are we absolute positive that they were working to throw the selection for Trump? Why would they do that?
Trump has promised to make America more assertive, to rebuild our military. These are not goals the Russian share. Why would they want him to be president?
(CROSSTALK)
BOLTON: I said during the election, I though if anything, if the Russians wanted either of the two candidates to be elected, they would much rather have Hillary Clinton.
(CROSSTALK)
CARLSON: Well, of course.
BOLTON: .because more likely that she would carry forward Obama's policies, which are much so --
(CROSSTALK)
CARLSON: So the storyline makes no sense.
(CROSSTALK)
BOLTON: Well, unless part of the effort is to diminish overall trust and confidence in American institutions on the part of the American people, which this debate, we've had for the past three months here, I think has gone a long way to do it. And a lot of people think that Trump won because the Russians changed the vote, which they have no evidence of.
CARLSON: But isn't -- I mean, isn't Paul Krugman doing that single- handedly without Putin's help?
BOLTON: He would qualify as a useful idiot in the Leninist version of this. But I think it's very important here, let's face it, neither you nor I, nor anybody watching this program that doesn't have the appropriate classification access really knows what the facts are.
That's why -- but so, talk is cheap. That is why this meeting between the president-elect and the intelligence community I think it's supposed to be this week, where they go over the data is going to be so important. I haven't seen it. I have talked to senators who have seen it. They think it's pretty clear Russia was involved. Let's see what the president will see.
(CROSSTALK)
CARLSON: I'm (INAUDIBLE) but open-minded.
Thanks a lot, ambassador.
BOLTON: Thank you.
CARLSON: It's great to see you.
Up next, newspaper editorial says Trump is wrong to shrug off Russia's cyber attacks. Attacks that undermine American democracy itself, but wait, are we sure that that actually happened? And if so, how do we know? An editor from that paper is here next.
CARLSON: Well, President-elect Trump famously skeptical over the idea that the Russians meddled in our presidential election. Well, some are not buying this now. We get to see any actual proof that they did. In fact, just moments ago, our friend and colleague Sean Hannity interviewed Julian Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks. The interview airs tomorrow at 10:00 p.m. Eastern on this channel, but here's what he told Sean about the source of those Clinton emails.
Watch.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
SEAN HANNITY, HOST, ""HANNITY"": Can you say to the American people, unequivocally, that you did not get this information about the DNC, John Podesta's emails, can you tell the American people 1000 percent you did not get it from Russia or anybody associated with Russia?
JULIAN ASSANGE, FOUNDER, WIKILEAKS: We can say, we have said repeatedly over the last two months that our source is not the Russian government and it is not state parties.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
CARLSON: Interesting.
There's a lot more news in that interview. It's going to air tomorrow at 10:00 on ""Hannity.""
You heard it right there. WikiLeaks says Russia is not behind all of this. Some are not buying that.
""Philadelphia Inquirer"" editorial board even asked who's side is Trump on?
Here now is Paul Davies. He's deputy editorial page editor of that paper. And so, Paul, thanks a lot for joining us today. SO you all wrote this pretty florid editorial today excoriating Trump for not taking this seriously. This was an attack on our democracy, on a free and fair election.
How do you know exactly that Russia was behind this?
PAUL DAVIES, PHILADELPHIA INQUIRER: Well the President Obama has announced it, the intelligence community's set side that was their assessment.
CARLSON: But they haven't offered any actual proof of it and most of the accounts of we have received about how they know this has been anonymous, anonymously sourced. As a journalist, are you comfortable taking at face value the assurances of anonymous government official's about something this important?
DAVIES: Well it's not just the president and the intelligence community. I mean Senator McCain, Senator McCaul, they have also come out, they have seen, they have heard the briefings, I obviously haven't heard the briefings. I don't think the president would be taking actions or issuing sanctions against Russia or kicking Russians out of the country, if he wasn't sure about the evidence.
CARLSON: Ok, so you just have faith that the president would not have a political motivation to do this that nobody involved without any other motive. They all must be telling the truth? Is that what you are saying?
DAVIES: They talked about this back in September. It is not before the election, before the there was even talk about the Russians being involved in the hacking.
CARLSON: Right. So, I mean they were mad, of course, because of emails from the DNC that were leaked to WikiLeaks somehow. Then, emails from John Podesta's personal Gmail account were leak. Some of those details were embarrassing. I think it is on the basis of that that people are saying this election was hacked. Sp which of those facts that fell into the public view do you think Americans shouldn't have known before they voted in November?
DAVIES: The point of the editorial was that if there is hacking going on, if it is interfering with our elections, and another country is doing that, that is a problem. It is a problem that undermines our democracy. And the point is, if President-Elect Trump as just as sort of shrugging it off and telling everybody to move on, it is not a big issue, that is the troubling aspect. The point is, we should have hearings, and we should get to the bottom of what happened. As much that can be disclosed, should be disclosed.
CARLSON: I agree with you. The thing is I still don't understand.
DAVIES: The intelligence communities have said that. They have released this information. I don't think that they would just go out and release stuff and provoke a country just over politics. That is very strange.
CARLSON: That has never happened before. Let me ask you this. You said, I agree with you. I want to know more, we all do, but you said this affected our election. And I'm not exactly sure how. Are you suggesting that the voting machines themselves were rigged? Are you referring to those emails? If you are referring to the emails, are you saying that we shouldn't have seen them before we voted?
CARLSON: If they influenced the election, causing people to vote, one way or another, that is their impact on what happened.
CARLSON: But how? How do they influence people to vote? How did that happen? Explain how it happened?
DAVIES: If people think that, because after they read to those emails that somehow they influence the vote one way or another, it influences their vote. I mean I don't have a document that says, 10 percent of people voted for Trump, or voted against Clinton because of that.
CARLSON: Right. It is speculation. You are saying you wish those emails, as a journalist, this is an important point, this the point. You are saying, you wish those emails had not gone into the public sphere, that we hadn't seen those emails, we would have less information when we voted? Is that what you are saying?
DAVIES: That is not what we said it all in the editorial.
CARLSON: What are you saying?
DAVIES: I'm all for having information out there to find out, the public should be fully informed.
CARLSON: So why are you upset about what happened during the election? We got more information? Why is that bad for Democracy, exactly?
DAVIES: What I'm upset about is that President-Elect Trump is just seems to be blowing the whole thing often telling everybody to move on.
CARLSON: Wait a second.
DAVIES: Relationships and connections to Russia, and his friendships and his appointment to Secretary of State, and other friends, that his positive assessment for Putin is what is troubling.
CARLSON: I get that you don't like Putin and you don't like Trump, but you said, I'm reading your editorial right here, you said instead of standing up to the bedrock of U.S. democracy- free and fair election, you said, Trump is a cavalier attitude regarding Russia's efforts to undermine America's democracy. I just want to get to the nub of what you are saying. How exactly, specifically, did they prevent that from being a fair and free election? How did they undermine democracy by telling us the things? You think we should not have known?
DAVIES: Yes. If they are hacking into the computer systems and releasing information, that influences our elections, that is troubling.
CARLSON: Ok. So, let me ask you, last question. If you could go back and undo that, would you do so? Would you make it so American voters didn't know the information they got from the WikiLeaks emails?
DAVIES: I don't think that a foreign country should be meddling in our.
CARLSON: You are not answering my question.
DAVIES: Regardless of what information is hacking cover, that is the point.
CARLSON: Do you think it was a good thing or a bad thing that we knew that information, before we voted?
DAVIES: I mean it depends on where you're coming from. You know if you want to know that information, I don't know.
CARLSON: How about as a voter? As a voter, is it better or worse to have that information?
DAVIES: Having all the information is what you want from a voter, but having it hacked is not what you want.
CARLSON: There you go. So, you like the ends, but not the means?
DAVIES: I don't want a foreign country hacking into any information on elections and the President-Elect blowing it off like it is not a big deal.
CARLSON: All right. I'm still having trouble understanding your argument, but thank you for the game. I appreciate it.
DAVIES: Ok.
CARLSON: Will we ever be able to see anything from the Russia investigation or will it all remain classified? Fox News Chief Intelligence Correspondent Catherine Herridge is here with the answer, Catherine, great to see you.
CATHERINE HERRIDGE, FOX NEWS CHIEF INTELLIGENCE CORRESPONDENT: Well thank you, Tucker. So we had the support last week from Homeland Security and the FBI which was really kind of thin in terms of the data that included about Russia, but it did identify two computer viruses, it is a fishing scheme to get information. Now, that is not a direct link to Russia, but these are viruses, if you will that are often used by the Russian intelligence services.
CARLSON: Ok.
HERRIDGE: My information is that there is a lot more intelligence beyond what was released last week. And the question for the intelligence community is how much of that will be declassified in order to make their case more publicly that there is this link, that it was directed by the Russian government. Now, to answer your first question, in a sort of a roundabout way, the president has asked for more extensive reports, our expectation is that a version of that will be declassified, sometime before the 20th.
What you to watch for they are is that there really is evidence of intent and motivation by the hackers, because that is the kind of intelligence that requires a human source, or one is called an electronic intercept, by picking up a phone call. So this is a very high threshold of information to have, number one, and number two, it would be highly unusual for the U.S. government to declassify that kind of information too.
CARLSON: And why would they do so?
HERRIDGE: We if you wanted to make the case that there really is that solid link to the Russian government, and that he was directed by those around Putin and Putin himself, you have to have very high quality intelligence and that is not always the intelligence that belongs to us, it can belong to our foreign partners, not really ours to disclose. And the Russians play a game, we have seen it in the past, where in they may deny being responsible for something. And they do it in an effort to force our hand to release information to satisfy the American people or others, our allies in general.
But when that happens, you burned the source and you burned the message, and that is really to Russia's advantage. So it is a real balancing act, but again, the thing to watch is intent and motivation, because that is the kind of intelligence that requires a human source or picking up a phone call and that is very hard to get. You also have to be very reluctant to burn that source for the future.
CARLSON: This is why the Russians are such good chess players.
HERRIDGE: Yes.
(LAUGHTER)
CARLSON: Exactly, Catherine Herridge great to see you, as always.
HERRIDGE: Yes, thank you.
CARLSON: Well some teachers around the country have abused students is some pretty appalling ways. They go on to new classrooms and new cities and no one is the wiser. How big is the problem? A big problem it turns out. An investigative reporter spent a year of looking into this, joined us next with details. Stay tuned.
CARLSON: One of those stories that it is hard to believe it is real, but it is. Across the country, teachers who have been kicked out of their classroom, often for sexual abuse on students, find their ways back into other classrooms in other schools. ""USA Today"" just released the findings of a year-long investigation, an amazing series into education officials putting kids in harm's way by making it easier for abusive teachers to find new jobs. Here now is USA Today Investigator Reporter Stephen Riley, who wrote it. I have to say, where a newspaper series just rivets the reader. This is an amazing series that you did. I just want to throw up a couple of examples that you found. The first, a high school football coach from Orange field, Texas, called Kit McFarlane, tell us about him.
STEPHEN REILLY, USA TODAY INVESTIGATOR REPORTER: Thanks for having me. The issue we looked at it is instances where teachers were disciplined for misconduct and lost their job. In one school district, where the school district did often, was secretly pass them along and kept allegation of misconduct and what specifically happen secret and allow those teachers to move on to other public school systems or private school systems, and obtain other jobs. In this case of Kit McFarlane in Texas, the Football coach, the school district investigated found more than a half-dozen instances where he made inappropriate comments to female high school students and negotiated and the correspondence we looked out, negotiated to a graceful exit for this teacher from the school district.
CARLSON: Here is the school district attorney, Karen Johnson, 2005. ""This incident does not have to end McFarlane's career. Unfortunately, didn't end his career.""
REILLY: Exactly.
CARLSON: And he went on to what?
REILLY: He went on to a neighboring school district, where those statements that were inappropriate turned into the school conduct that was inappropriate, he engaged in the sexual misconduct with a student, currently incarcerated. That second school district had really no way of knowing what happened in the first school district because the misconduct wasn't reported to state authorities.
CARLSON: What I find so amazing, that is one part, but you had a couple of instances where the new employer called the old school and asked specifically, is there anything I should know about this guy, and the teacher, the abuser, was giving a clean review by the previous school that knew better. Why would they lie on behalf of abusers?
REILLY: In some cases that we looked at, they are all contractually obligated to give a neutral or positive recommendation to this teacher. The shorthand for it is passing the trash. The school district will send a confidential settlement agreement to get rid of the teacher as an expeditiously as possible. So in exchange, the teacher leaving the school district will agree not to tell prospective future employers what actually happened. And end of the teacher's employment of the school district.
CARLSON: This is unbelievable. A guy in New Jersey, in the Mounts field Public School Jason Fennes he signed a contract stating that only his positions and dates of employment would be given to future employers. Then, he went on to a private school and what happened?
REILLY: He abused children of the private school and he also recently pled guilty to molesting children once he arrived to the private school. So the public school had knowledge of misbehavior, they didn't want that teacher around the students anymore, but they just simply made him and other school systems problem.
CARLSON: I assume he was being protected by the union, in this case.
REILLY: That plays a part in it. It is incredibly expensive and difficult to go through the proper channels in some cases, to get rid of a problem teacher. That is often why we see some of these agreements.
CARLSON: That is just unbelievable. This is really a great series. I can't recommend a more highly. It lives on the web forever. If you are watching this, you should read it, in case you are a good mood and want to change that. Stephen Riley, great piece.
REILLY: Thank you for having me.
CARLSON: Does your boss make you stay on top of work emails from home? In France, there is a new law that you may want to show your boss tomorrow morning. It may work only in France, though. Plus, Ed Henry joins us in ""The Friend Zone"" you saw him all last week. He is back.
CARLSON: Here is something new. Ignoring work emails from home is now the law in France which is a country in Europe. New legislation lets employees unplug from work emails while off the clock without any fear of losing their jobs or any fear of sanctions at all. French lawmakers pointed to a study from the University of British Columbia, that shows people who are told to check their emails only three times per day work, not surprisingly, less stressed than their counterparts who are always checking their emails. That is of course true. Another study showed the people who don't work at all are far less stress than people with jobs. There is no word on the effect on productivity, something that apparently is not a concern in France.
It is time now for ""The Friend Zone,"" the after minute the end of the show, we are joined side by Ed Henry, who took over this set all last week. I was in Davos with the world leaders, charting a course for the world. We were talking about you in the sauna. When I got back, my producers were so upset by the tiered you imposed. They said, the whole time, it was Perrier, not Pellegrino. On visible demands.
ED HENRY, SENIOR NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: They are putting us against each other, my friend. This is ""The Friend Zone."" they said the opposite, they said they were so happy to have me, they can't wait to have me back, but I will tell you, as soon as I got here tonight, I was reminded, I am a mere fill in. Just a couple of nights ago and is this very studio in New York, I had an entire anchor desk. Now, as you can see, I'm relegated to a chair. I have just a chair. And they told me, Tucker, that you are the one who said make sure to remind him who is the host of the show.
(LAUGHTER)
CARLSON: Actually, I heard you were great and they love you. Did you like it?
HENRY: I enjoyed it. I was trying to take your staff out to lunch last Friday.
CARLSON: That is nice.
HENRY: Part of it, it was kind of showing you up a little I guess, but in all seriousness, they were really nice to me, and I thought they made me look really good. So I should go out of my way, the end of the year, and half the staff got sick, or allegedly sick, and a three-day weekend for two years. They didn't show up on Friday. Not trying to get them in trouble, but I guess maybe I just did, but I think they were all very sick, by the way. For our boss, they are all very sick.
CARLSON: Do you know why?
HENRY: We had to cancel.
CARLSON: They should have been eating your mother's cooking. I was watching ""Fox & Friends,"" do we have tape on this, Ed's mom was on ""Fox & Friends,"" whipping up something, do we have video? There it is.
HENRY: We are just feeding the ego and at this point, she is on Facebook telling her friends that she might get a cooking show on Fox. Abby Huntsman is feeding it, now, Tucker is endorsing it. I mean, Christine Henry may have a bigger footprint. There she is on Christmas, as well as my dad and other family members, but she may have a bigger footprint at Fox then me.
(LAUGHTER)
CARLSON: That is so impressive. There she is on Christmas, too. Is she a good cook?
HENRY: She is a great cook. You know what is funny is that for Christmas, she made a sausage and meatballs, and Italian feast. She is not a drop of Italian blood in her. She is Irish and German, all this other great things, but she makes some of the greatest Italian food I've ever had.
CARLSON: Yes, well a lot of it is appropriate the cooking of Italy. Really quickly, your book, which we talked about last time you were on, I was mesmerized, when is it out?
HENRY: April 4th, the beginning of the baseball season comments about Jackie Robinson. In April, it will be the 70th anniversary of his first game. Here's the cool thing, we talked about on this very program about two weeks ago. It was number one in baseball books on amazon.com. Not to boast, but to say, I will tell you, this is the bottom line truth, all last week, the amount of tweets I got, your show, and a month or so, has gotten so much attention, people were responding. And for every time I had got paid, somebody said you're doing a good job, I got two or three or four tweets saying, we've missed Tucker. People are responding to you, hats off to you.
CARLSON: I was tweeting under an assumed name from Davos.
(LAUGHTER)
CARLSON: (Inaudible) great to see you.
HENRY: That song sound, I don't know, I don't want to think about it.
CARLSON: It was wild. Thanks a lot. It was really nice to see you. Coming up, it's almost time for ""News Abuse,"" keep sending examples on twitter at @Tuckercarlson or email tuckercarlsontonight@foxnews.com We got some good ones coming up.
CARLSON: Time for ""News Abuse."" We ask you to send us the most egregious examples of media bias and dumbness. You have seen it, much to choose from. We got this headline from ""the Washington post."" ""Russian operation hacked a Vermont utility showing risk to U.S. electrical grid security, officials say."" Of course, if you got the article now you would see a huge correction on top, it turns out the whole thing was fake news. Not the only fake news in that highly fake newspaper. High energy tweeted this headline from ""The Huffington Post,"" ""Donald Trump and his cabinet will trade on inside information as president."" The first sentence of the pieces said this, ""Actually, I don't know that Donald Trump will take advantage of the inside information he will have access to as president, but no one knows that he won't.""
(LAUGHTER)
The new standard, I guess. Can you just prove it? Ok, must be true. Eric Permented tweeted this, ""The most egregious example of dumbness goes to Mr. Don Lemon at CNN, a big drunk, an awkward on New Year's Eve."" Let's go to the tape.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Can we please not give him a shot, by the way?
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Everything is pretty sterilized and ready to go.
DON LEMON, CNN TONIGHT NEWS SHOW HOST: I cannot believe I am doing this.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Wow.
LEMON: Hold on. I'm a bad person today. I'm not selfish.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Are we going there right now?
LEMON: I'm not a selfish, but I am self-centered.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
CARLSON: Don Lemon got drunk on tequila and got his ears pierced live on CNN.
(LAUGHTER)
It is hard not to kind of like Don Lemon. I'll admit it, I like Don Lemon. He is so florid. Well tomorrow night, mean tweets are back, send your cruelest @Tuckercarlson or email us at tuckercarlsontonight@foxnews.com That is it for us tonight. Tune in every night, this show is the sworn enemy of lying, pomposity, smugness and group think, O'Reilly next."
0	65	 66 von 72	Fox News Network	January 2, 2017 Monday	 FOX SPECIAL REPORT WITH BRET BAIER	 6:00 PM EST		"BRET BAIER, FOX NEWS CHIEF POLITICAL ANCHOR: The intel community versus the President-Elect over Russia and hacking. The Obama administration takes action but the incoming administration wants more evidence.
This is SPECIAL REPORT.
Good evening. Welcome to Washington and Happy New Year. I'm Bret Baier.
The intelligence community wants you to know, in their view Russia was definitely behind the hack of U.S. political figures leading up to the election. But Fox News has learned intelligence officials are weighing just what to further reveal without giving away sources and methods.
This -- as critics, including President-Elect Trump, are saying not so fast. They want firm evidence. The President-Elect is meeting with intel officials this week and insist there is more to this story. 
Chief intelligence correspondent Catherine Herridge joins me tonight with what we're learning. Good evening -- Catherine.
CATHERINE HERRIDGE, FOX NEWS CHIEF INTELLIGENCE CORRESPONDENT: Well thank you -- Bret.
Fox News has learned that there is a healthy debate within the intelligence community over how much additional information should be declassified to show the hacks were a Russian-driven operation.
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
HERRIDGE: An intelligence source says there is more information about Russian involvement in the election hacks than what was released last week by the FBI and Homeland Security. But the concern is exposing sources, methods, as well as collection by foreign allies who work with the U.S. The future White House press secretary urged caution until all the facts are known.
SEAN SPICER, INCOME WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: Once that report is made final and the President-Elect is brief, then I think we will have a better idea of what to make of the situation.
HERRIDGE: The hacker's intent and motivation were not fully addressed in the joint analysis report last week, proving Russian President Vladimir Putin's alleged role and who was behind the operation or even higher standards to meet.
The House Intelligence Committee's senior Democrats said Sunday the evidence is undeniable.
ADAM SCHIFF (D), CALIFORNIA: It's very solid. It's indeed overwhelming. They didn't just steal data, they weaponized it. They dumped it during an election with the specific intent of influencing the outcomes of that election and sowing discord in the United States. That is not something China has ever done.
HERRIDGE: China has stolen economic secrets. After this Chinese military hacking unit in Shanghai was exposed by an American security firm, the Justice Department indicted five people.
ERIC HOLDER, FORMER U.S. ATTORNEY GENERAL: This is a case alleging economic espionage by members of the Chinese military.
HERRIDGE: But when China stole the records of 21.5 million people from the Office of Personnel Management security clearance database, the Obama administration did not publicly punish Beijing by expelling diplomats and sanctions were only threatened. One cyber security analyst said the response to Russia does not seem proportional.
MORGAN WRIGHT, CYBER SECURITY ANALYST: They've taken action like this for a report that's 398 words of analysis, if at that, and expel 35 people. There should've been 35 Chinese diplomats expelled for OPM, not 35 Russian diplomats expelled for bad security practices on the part of the DNC.
HERRIDGE: Over the weekend, the Russian diplomats boarded a private jet and left the United States. Given the alleged Russian hacking began in the summer of 2015, a senior Republican said the administration waited too long to act.
TOM COTTON (R), ARKANSAS: What Vladimir Putin needs is a sense of new boundaries. He's had a free reign throughout the world over the last eight years. He needs to have a sense of boundaries and to know that costs are going to be imposed if he crosses those boundaries.
(END VIDEOTAPE)
HERRIDGE: This week, Mr. Trump plans to get his own in-depth briefing on the intelligence. President Obama has requested a comprehensive report before he leaves office on the 20th -- Bret.
BAIER: Ok. We'll follow it. Catherine -- thank you.
HERRIDGE: You're welcome.
BAIER: Eight people are in custody in Turkey following a New Year's attack on an Istanbul nightclub that left 39 people dead. The shooter caught on surveillance is still at large. But Turkish authorities say they are close to identifying him.
Correspondent Benjamin Hall has the latest tonight on the horrific attack wringing in 2017 in Turkey.
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
BENJAMIN HALL, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Istanbul remains on high alert today as a huge manhunt continues to find the attacker who killed 39 New Year's Eve revelers. More details of the attack have been emerging.
The gunman who fired up to 180 bullets stopped to swap out magazines five times. He then changed his clothes in the kitchen of the club before leaving in a taxi amid the chaos. According to experts, the suspect appears to have been professionally trained.
METIN GURCAN, SECURITY ANALYST: It was not planned as a sort of suicide mission. It was planned as a hit-and-run, you know, mission. The attacker, right now he's on the run and he planned his exit strategy.
HALL: ISIS issued in a statement saying the attack had been carried out by quote, ""a heroic soldier"" of theirs and the club was chosen because it's where quote, ""Christians were celebrating their pagan feast.""
Police are still trying to learn his identity though. But there are suggestions that he's part of the same ISIS cell which attacked Istanbul airport back in June killing 41 as a result. They believe he may be from the central Asian countries of Uzbekistan or Kyrgyzstan.
Today the funerals of some of the dead began taking place and the identities of more victims were released. Among the 39 killed 27 were foreign, including victims from Israel, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Germany, Russia, France, India and Belgium. The Turkish prime minister spoke today, saying that terrorism was everywhere, a global problem.
BINALI YILDIRIM, TURISH PRIME MINISTER (through translator): Terror cannot intimidate us. We will intimidate terror. We will continue to fight against it.
HALL: American William Raak (ph) is among the dozens who were injured -- the businessman from Delaware celebrating his 325th birthday at the club when the shooting broke out.
WILLIAM RAAK, AMERICAN BUSINESSMAN: It's a massive tragedy. This is very unfortunate. I was with nine people and seven of us were shot. Seven of us were shot.
(END VIDEOTAPE)
HALL: President Obama offered his condolences to the Turkish people today and said the U.S. is ready to do whatever it could to help bring this attacker to justice -- Bret.
BAIER: Benjamin Hall in London. Benjamin -- thank you.
Suicide bombers carried out several deadly attacks in Iraq today. At least 36 people were killed at a market in Baghdad when a truck loaded with explosives detonated there. ISIS claimed responsibility for that attack. Two other attacks were launched by suicide bombers outside two police stations in the central city of Samarra. At least seven officers were killed in those two attacks.
In the coming weeks, the USS George H.W. Bush will be back in the Middle East, helping in the fight against ISIS. The aircraft carrier was delayed for six months for technical reasons but now the ship's crew says it's ready to go.
Pentagon producer Lucas Tomlinson recently spent time on deck and files this report.
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
LUCAS TOMLINSON, FOX NEWS PENTAGON PRODUCER: Only about half of the Navy's F-18 Hornets expected to be flying right now can actually get off the ground. Young aviators are losing valuable training hours -- a problem some Navy pilots say can never be made up.
Five years ago, Navy pilots averaged over a thousand flight hours after their first tour and 500 carrier landings known as traps. Today that number has been reduced to just 750 flight hours and only 150 carrier landings.
On a recent visit to USS George H.W. Bush preparing to deploy to the Mideast in the coming weeks, the head of the ships air wing says his pilots are just as ready as he was.
CAP. JAMES MCCALL, U.S. NAVY: I think their hours are fairly indicative of the hours that I got as a young guy. And what I would say is that our training systems, to include our aircraft, as well as our training evolutions themselves are far superior to what I received when I was a young guy.
TOMLINSON: Some critics question whether the U.S. has the ability to fight to conflicts at once given the strain on today's force.
LT. GEN. DAVID DEPTULA, U.S. AIRFORCE: All we can handle is one major theater of war -- that encourages adventurism on the part of someone else. We have to be able to fight and win in a minimum of two major theater wars simultaneously or near simultaneously. And we're not there in terms of actual capability.
HALL: Fox News has documented some of the challenges facing the U.S. military when it comes to readiness in getting their jets airworthy and read for war.
A different story here aboard USS George H.W. Bush. The pilots and commanders I've spoken with today say they have all the money, the funding, and the parts they need to successfully conduct their mission.
During the visit to Bush F-18s and other aircraft landed every 60 seconds. The crew hopes to get that time down to 40 seconds before deployment.
REAR ADM. KENNETH WHITESELL, U.S. NAVY: We have some of the best-trained, highly-smart kids that we've ever seen come in the Navy right now. The thing is they come out here and you look on the flight deck and these 18 to 22-year-old kids are demonstrating responsibility and demonstrating tactical proficiency at the jobs that they do.
(END VIDEOTAPE)
HALL: To meet today's threats the Navy says it must grow its fleet by 30 percent and the Air Force must add 30,000 more airmen and the Army and Marine Corps also want to add thousands to its ranks -- something President-Elect Trump has vowed to make happen -- Bret.
BAIER: Lucas Tomlinson at the Pentagon. Lucas -- thank you.
What do you think the biggest challenge facing America's military will be? Let me know on Twitter @BretBaier, use the #SpecialReport or on Facebook at facebook.com/BretBaierSR.
North Korea's leader is kicking off 2017 with promises of more missile tests and a stronger military. Kim Jong-Un made the pledge during his annual New Year's address and he even hinted that a test launch of an intercontinental ballistic missile could because coming soon. The North Korean leader wants the U.S. to end war games with his rival South Korea.
President Obama is leaving office in 18 days. But he is showing he is not going quietly.
Correspondent Shannon Bream reports from the White House tonight on the President's plans for his final days in office.
SHANNON BREAM, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: As critics roll out their assessments of President Obama's two terms in the White House, he is preparing to make a final pitch of his own.
Citing the example of George Washington's 1796 peaceful Democratic transfer of power, President Obama says he will give a farewell speech from Chicago next Tuesday evening.
JESSICA TARLOV, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST: I hope it's a nice balance of the big achievements that he's had and also the call to action to keep the progress moving forward.
BREAM: In an email announcing the remarks, Mr. Obama said quote, ""I'm thinking about them as a chance to say thank you for this amazing journey, to celebrate the ways you've changed this country for the better these past eight years and to offer some thoughts on where we all go from here.""
LYNN SWEET, CHICAGO SUN-TIMES: Chicago is the place where he started his political career. Chicago is the place where he based his two national campaigns. Chicago is a place where he met his wife, raised his family. Chicago is an important part of Obama's story.
BREAM: This weekend he began tweeting items of quote ""remarkable progress"" over the last eight years, including ""After decades of rising healthcare costs, today nearly every American now has access to the financial security of affordable health care,"" a claim critics question.
ILYA SHAPIRO, CATO INSTITUTE: It's unclear first of all how many more people now have health care or health care insurance -- those are different things -- than before Obamacare. A lot of the growth in Obamacare exchange insurance is simply people who have lost the plans that they liked that were forced now into these worse Obamacare plans.
BREAM: On Wednesday the President will meet with Capitol Hill Democrats to talk about coalescing a strategy to say what many regard as his signature legislative accomplishment though Obamacare passed without a single GOP vote.
The President also tweeted about gains in the economy, bringing U.S. troops home, and bolstering clean energy.
TARLOV: I do think he feels a burden to be talking about those things because if you look at the electoral scoreboard, we don't look like we did so good. So I think it is critical for him.
BREAM: There's also the matter of a legacy made up of heavy emphasis from the use of executive power.
SHAPIRO: If you live by executive action, you die by executive action. And so I would expect on day one, two, three of the Trump administration, there to be a rescinding of a lot of rules and regulations, a lot of orders.
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
BREAM: The President has also granted hundreds of acts of clemency either by pardoning people or commuting their sentences in recent weeks. And the White House says we should expect more of that before he leaves office later this month -- Bret.
BROWN: Shannon Bream, live on the north lawn. Shannon -- thank you.
Any hope for an easy nomination process for the next president's cabinet picks are being quickly dashed. Senate Democrats are promising a fight on at least eight of President-Elect Trump's picks.
Correspondent Peter Doocy reports tonight from New York on Democrats pledging to drag out several fights.
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
PETER DOOCY, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: It's going to be quiet in the cabinet room until springtime if Senate Democrats get their way. Democratic minority Leader Chuck Schumer is targeting eight of Trump's picks to be cabinet secretaries for complex confirmation hearings designed to last until March.
That means the 45th president may go months without about half of his cabinets at positions atop the State Department, the Justice Department, the EPA and five others that require Senate approval are targeted for partisan political reasons.
Senator Schumer explains the left thinking like this. Quote, ""President- Elect Trump is attempting to build his rigged cabinet with nominees that would break key campaign promises and have made billions off the industries they would be tasked with regulating.
But Republican leaders are quick to point out they quickly helped President Obama fill his cabinet with a spokesman for the Majority Leader Mitch McConnell saying quote, ""The Senate confirmed seven of his nominees on day one and nearly all were confirmed within two weeks."" Senator Schumer and others approved wholeheartedly of this approach at the time.
Mr. Trump's first White House press secretary Sean Spicer hopes Senator Schumer remembers Republicans' cooperation eight years ago.
SEAN SPICER, TRUMP WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: For these Democrats to now talk about how they are going to obstruct these qualified cabinet members from taking office is rather sad. And I think Chuck Schumer, of all people, he was there then. He understands that there's a difference between opposing people on policy and allowing the President to have the constitutional right to choose his cabinet as long as their qualified. And each one of these people is unbelievably qualified to serve and to bring real change to the various departments that are on the government.
DOOCY: One big thing Democrats want are the financial records of the eight Trump nominees they plan to slow down, especially secretary of State- designee Rex Tillerson, who has been in charge of ExxonMobil for years. But analysts aren't so sure it's good politics for Democrats to be so aggressively opposed to a recently-elected president's picks.
SHIRA CENTER, BOSTON GLOBE POLITICAL EDITOR: I don't think Americans will have a huge appetite for listening to eight-long drawn-out confirmation hearings. But I don't think that's actually what's going to happen.
I think in the end Democrats are going to zero in on between one to three, maybe even just one or two, and really question those. And you will see Democratic senators zero in on their biographies and their histories and it will last a couple of days.
(END VIDEOTAPE)
DOOCY: So the people trying to become the highest ranking members of the Trump administration may face the most resistance in decades and that is with V.A. secretary and Agriculture secretary jobs still open. Today a senior transition official told Fox News a leading contender to become Agriculture secretary is Georgia's former Republican governor, Sonny Perdue -- Bret.
BAIER: Peter Doocy outside Trump Tower. Peter -- thank you.
Let's take a closer look now at one of the Trump nominees Democrats plan to try to slow walk through those confirmation hearings.
Correspondent Doug McKelway reports tonight on Betsy DeVos -- Trump's choice for Education secretary.
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY), MAJORITY LEADER: The conversation with our new secretary of Education.
DOUG MCKELWAY, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: In her first Capitol Hill visit since being made Education secretary-designate, Betsy DeVos enjoyed a bit of calm with the Senate Majority Leader before what could be a storm of a confirmation hearing.
There's little middle ground of opinion about DeVos. School choice advocates embrace her.
JEB BUSH, FORMER GOVERNOR OF FLORIDA: What a phenomenal strong woman. She will do an extra ordinary job as secretary of Education. We all are looking forward to working with her, I know.
MCKELWAY: Teachers unions despise her. The head of the American Federation of Teachers writing quote, ""In nominating Betsy DeVos, Trump makes it loud and clear that his education policy will focus on privatizing, defunding, and destroying public education in America.
DeVos relishes the fight. In her home state of Michigan, she has for decades contributed part of her considerable wealth to candidates and causes that push for school choice. It has paid off with about 300 charter schools in the state. In Detroit, 53 percent of students go to charter schools, second only to New Orleans.
But test results are mixed. A well-regarded 2013 study finds quote, the typical student in Michigan charter schools gains more learning in a year than its traditional public school counterparts.
But more recently, ""The New York Times"" reported about Michigan quote, ""It is also among the worst places to argue that choices make schools better. ""Most charter schools perform below the state average.""
One former Education secretary offers an explanation for the hostility over DeVos and school choice.
BILL BENNETT, FORMER EDUCATION SECRETARY: Unions offered more than anything else, hate the loss of control, hate the loss of -- giving up their power. That's what it's about. It's about a power struggle.
MCKELWAY: Whatever the testing results many parents continue to clamor for school choice. An anecdote from Jeb Bush partly explains why. He described watching as Florida governor, a public school senior struggling to answer a simple written to graduate.
BUSH: A baseball game starts at 3:00, it ends at 4:30. How long is the game? He couldn't answer it. I mean I cried.
(END VIDEOTAPE)
MCKELWAY: Devos' pick as Education secretary also comes at a time when parents, teachers, school districts are chafing over the suffocating effect of federal mandates and bureaucracy that they believe inhibits local control.
In Washington -- Doug McKelway, Fox News.
Up next, President Obama's last ditch effort to save his signature health care law.
First here's what some of our Fox affiliates around the country are covering tonight. Fox 9 in Minneapolis where three people, rather, face charges for a protest during an NFL game Sunday. Two people are accused of rappelling down from the roof during a Minnesota-Vikings game to hang a banner protesting the Dakota Access Pipeline. The third person was arrested for obstructing the legal process.
Fox 25 in Boston, where Democrat Senator Elizabeth Warren is leading an effort to get legal marijuana shops banking access. Warren has joined nine other senators asking the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network to issue guidance to banks so they can accommodate the financial needs of legal pot shops.
And this is a live look at Los Angeles from our affiliate Fox 11, the Santa Monica Pier there. The big story there tonight, the search for the person who altered the ""Hollywood"" sign to read ""Hollyweed"". Southern Californians woke up New Years day to the iconic sign's new message that was altered using tarps. If found -- the suspect or suspects face misdemeanor trespassing charges.
That's tonight's live look outside the Beltway from SPECIAL REPORT. We will be right back.
BAIER: After ending the year with the most murders in two decades, Chicago police are starting this year with a plan to curb the deadly violence in that city.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
EDDIE JOHNSON, CHICAGO POLICE SUPERINTENDENT: What matters is that we have to send a message to these individuals to not pick up a gun in the city of Chicago. If you do pick up a gun and you use it, you will be held accountable. Right now, we don't do that.
(END VIDEOTAPE)
BAIER: Some of toughest gun laws in the country-- Chicago ended 2016 with 762 homicides. Today Donald Trump, the President-Elect, weighed in on the situation on Twitter, saying ""If Mayor Rahm Emanuel can't do it, he must quote, `ask for federal help'"".
The hunt is on for an inmate who escaped a Rhode Island detention center. Massachusetts state police say they have recovered a stolen car believed to have been used by the 35-year-old who escaped over the weekend. Investigators say James Morales got out by scaling the detention center building and then climbing over razor wire.
The Department of Homeland Security reports a surge in illegal immigrants over a 12-month period, a number that exceeds the two years prior. But despite the growing number of illegal border crossings, the Obama administration insists there's good news when they look at the numbers.
Senior correspondent Adam Housley reports from Los Angeles tonight. Good evening -- Adam.
ADAM HOUSLEY, FOX NEWS SENIOR CORRESPONDENT: Bret -- for the second time in the last three years, the U.S. is seeing a massive spike in illegal immigration. New data released by the Department of Homeland Security shows a 15 percent surge in the last fiscal year ending in September 2016.
According to the numbers released by DHS on Friday, total apprehensions across the country jumped by 67,000 to more than 530,000 all told illegal immigrants apprehended. DHC also reports they've set nearly 451,000 back to their home countries.
Most recently we saw the same type of spike back in 2014; both surges mostly coming from Central American countries -- Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala. And while the administration argues that many of these migrants are fleeing ongoing high crime and violence, and that is the cause, Art del Cueto from the Border Patrol Union says the push has always been there -- migrants tell him and other officers, it's actually the poll here state- side that is responsible.
ART DEL CUETO, BORDER PATROL UNION: They are saying we are coming over before the other administration comes because we fear that there's going to be a wall put up and we won't be -- it won't be that easy to come across.
HOUSLEY: The report also says sanctuary cities are significantly impacting the removal of illegal immigrants across the country, also fueling the surge. Meantime some human rights advocates have urged the Obama administration to treat this as a refugee crisis because the number of families and unaccompanied children sneaking across the border is higher.
In a statement, Secretary Jeh Johnson said that these latest numbers show the administration policies specifically target criminals. Quote, ""We continue to better focus our interior resources on removing individuals who may pose threats to public safety, specifically convicted criminals, and threats to national security. Significantly an increasing percentage of those deported from the interior were convicted of serious crimes.
(END VIDEOTAPE)
HOUSLEY: DHS also says the shifting demographic to a larger proportion of Central Americans crossing has placed an added strain on resources due to the cost of sending people back to Central America -- Bret.
BAIER: Adam -- thank you. Arizona's most outspoken sheriff, one of the most outspoken sheriffs nationwide in fact, and one of the biggest proponents of enforcing immigration laws, is off the job tonight. Metro Phoenix Sheriff Joe Arpaio left his job Sunday after 24 years. He may be best known for housing inmates in tents and making them wear pink underwear tense, but also more recently, for his five year investigation into President Obama's birth certificate which Arpaio's investigative team still insists is not real.
The conclusion the President and White House officials call ""ridiculous"", Republican stopped talking about it long ago and even President-Elect who launched his own investigation has said the President was born in the United States. Arpaio lost reelection in November after six terms in office. He is leaving office after being charged with a crime, misdemeanor contempt of court for prolonging his immigration patrols against the orders of a federal judge. He could face up to six months in jail if convicted.
Republicans in Washington are saying they plan to start dismantling Obamacare as soon as tomorrow, the first day of the new Congress. But even with just days left in office, President Obama is not giving up.
Chief congressional correspondent Mike Emanuel reports on the President's last ditch effort to save his signature health care law.
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
MIKE EMANUEL, FOX NEWS CHIEF CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT: President Obama and Democrats in the House and Senate will meet Wednesday to make a last- ditch effort to save the President's signature health care law.
Today ahead of the closed-door meeting the House Democratic leader issued this morning to the G.O.P.
NANCY PELOSI (D-CA), MINORITY LEADER: The fact is it's the old thing of going into a China shop. You break it, you own it. And this is -- they are dealing with something that is very -- when I say complex, it's sophisticated.
EMANUEL: It may be complex but over the weekend the President-Elect said Obamacare is also unaffordable and doesn't work.
DONALD TRUMP (R), U.S. PRESIDENT-ELECT: Well, he is president until January 20th. And then after that, it's our turn. So let's see what happens. I mean he's got to protect what he wants to do and perhaps you could say his legacy.
If you look at Obamacare, you have in many cases, over 100 percent increase -- it's unaffordable.
EMANUEL: Despite those comments the interim DNC chair is taking a wait and see approach with Mr. Trump.
DONNA BRAZILE, DNC INTERIM CHAIR: Let's see what he intends to do in terms of Obamacare. Will he just repeal it without putting up an alternative that will strengthen it? Or will he continue to, you know, just say I'm going to, you know, just get rid of it.
EMANUEL: Fox has confirmed incoming Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer, House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi, and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders are planning a call to action on Sunday, January 15th for Democrats in congress and their allies. They plan to criticize Republican efforts to repeal and replace the law and hope to spotlight those now covered by Obamacare.
Still Republicans are expected to have the votes to scrap the law. Experts say the bigger issue is what's next.
DOUGLAS HOLTZ-EAKIN, AMERICAN ACTION FORUM: The hard part is the replace. And Republicans have had a lot of plans for a number of years now but this time they have to pick one -- and as a party unite behind it and pass it. That's going to take some genuine hard work.
(END VIDEOTAPE)
EMANUEL: On the same day the President is meeting with Democrats, House Republicans will have a VIP visitor as well. Fox has confirmed Vice President-Elect Mike Pence will rally House Republicans Wednesday. A GOP leadership aide says Pence will discuss with lawmakers a plan to dismantle the health care law -- Bret.
BAIER: Mike -- thank you.
The New Year means new laws. And this year the laws target everything from cell phones to service animals.
Correspondent Joel Waldman joins us live with a look at some of the more interesting laws now on the books. Good evening -- Joel.
JOEL WALDMAN, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Bret -- good evening to you.
For some, a New Year means new resolutions. But across the country, there are more than just resolutions being put into effect. There are new laws. And this year you may find yourself forced into texting less or dropping those extra pesky pounds whether you choose to or not.
In the City of Brotherly Love for example, it might be a little easier to battle those love handles thanks to a new city law. Philadelphia becomes the first major American city levying a tax on sugary sodas -- one-and-a- half cents an ounce to be exact, adding nearly a quarter to every 16-ounce drink purchased. The beverage industry already challenging the law in court.

JIM KENNEY (D), PHILADELPHIA MAYOR: I would hope that the soda folks would understand how important this is to our children's future and to our city's future and not proceed. But we'll see what happens.

WALDMAN: And that temptation to text while driving will take a toll on your wallet, if not much worse. In California a new statewide law prohibits you from even holding your phone behind the wheel.

And while you can still fish for compliments in Illinois, don't try to catch a catfish using a pitchfork, spear gun, or bow and arrow, otherwise you'll get the hook from the state run Fish and Wildlife Service. And speaking of weapons, anyone 19 or older who owns a gun in Missouri can now carry it concealed in public without training or a permit.

WALDMAN: And while dogs may be man's best friend, I know my Mabel Rose is, a new Colorado law is making sure your canine is no more than you claim it is. It's a crime to misrepresent a pet as a service animal. Officials say untrained pooches interfere with real service dogs.
And Bret, we know you love your golf, but you may need to spend more time swinging the nine-iron in Ohio, in the Buckeye state, where residents are now allowed to use their carts on the road. The one caveat, you can go over 35 miles an hour.

President-elect Trump questions the intelligence community over Russia and hacking. Our all-star panel weighs in on what comes next after the break.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
SEAN HANNITY, FOX NEWS HOST: Did Russia give you this information or anybody associated with Russia?
JULIAN ASSANGE, WIKILEAKS FOUNDER: Our source is not a state party. The answer for our interactions is no. But if we look at, we look at the most recent statement by the U.S. government, on the 29th of December, we had five different branches of government -- Treasury, DHS, FBI, White House, presenting their accusations to underpin Obama's throwing out 35 Russian diplomats. What was missing from all of those statements, the word ""WikiLeaks."" It's very strange.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
BAIER: Sean Hannity's interview with Julian Assange, the head of WikiLeaks, it airs tomorrow on HANNITY. This as the back and forth between the intelligence community and the president-elect continues. We're hearing that there will be final report likely in coming days and hearing from the president-elect on New Year's eve that he plans to possibly say something as well.
Let's start there. Let's bring in our panel, Mollie Hemingway, senior editor at ""The Federalist,"" Mara Liasson, National Political Correspondent of National Public Radio, and syndicated columnist Charles Krauthammer. OK, Mollie, you hear Assange and then you hear what officials are saying privately, intelligence officials, to all kinds of reporters around town. And there is a call for more hard evidence, although they say it's cut and drt.
MOLLIE HEMINGWAY, ""THE FEDERALIST"": Last week president Obama put out the report, and I think a lot of people were hoping that there would be more specifics in that report. It turned out to be kind of paltry, vague, didn't really provide a lot of detail that skeptics were hoping for. And that comes from cyber security experts, people who aren't big fans of Donald Trump. One guy, Jeffrey Carr, said it added nothing to the conversation about what the extent of Russia's meddling was. In one case it just took a listing that a private company had put out of groups that it thought had ties to Russia and just grouped that all under Russian intelligence services without actually providing corroboration or substantiation. So a lot of people are worried that the manner in which this information has been shared makes it seem more like it's a domestic political operation than actual foreign policy -- that Russia is a serious threat.
BAIER: Mara, these intelligence officials say they are debating how frat to go down the road in what to reveal because of sources and methods.
MARA LIASSON, NATIONAL PUBLIC RADIO: They want to do two things. They want to show that what they have is real and they've come to this conclusion, it's a consensus conclusion that Russia did hack into the DNC and, quote, ""weaponize"" the information. But they also want to protect their sources and methods. Sometimes the intelligence community has to go farther than they want to make it really clear, since Russia is denying it, that this happened. They certainly seem to have convinced most Republicans on the Hill that this happened. They've convinced almost everyone except for Donald Trump.
BAIER: Let's be clear. There is a melding of the words here. When they say ""hack the election,"" we have to be very clear. We are talking about hacking officials like John Podesta.
LIASSON: It not the balloting process.
BAIER: Not the actual voting.
LIASSON: Right, and that's really important because I think this is where Donald Trump is really sensitive, somehow saying that Russia is the reason that he won. Nobody is saying that. He won decisively. He won fair and square. Nobody is taking that away from him. But during the campaign, he acted, he certainly wanted those hacked emails to help him because he talked about them on the stump over and over again, and did Mike Pence, and he even half-jokingly said Russia should find the 30,000 missing emails of Hillary Clinton. So he talked about the results of that hacking a lot.
But that is different, this is a cyber-attack that most members of the national security community and most Republican officials on the Hill think was really serious and needs stronger, tougher measures than what they say was the week Obama administration response.
BAIER: Charles, here is what the incoming Trump administration is saying before we know all of the specifics. They are pointing to the Chinese hack of OPM where they took millions and millions of identification numbers, so security numbers of government employees. Here's a story from the ""New York Times."" ""The Obama administration has determined,"" this is July 31st, 2015, that it must retaliate against China for the theft of personnel information of more than 20 million Americans from the databases of the Office of Personnel Management. But it is still struggling to decide what it can do without prompting an escalating cyber conflict. In public Mr. Obama has said almost nothing, and officials are under strict instruction to avoid naming China as the source of that attack.""
The Trump folks, Charles, are pointing to that, saying they chose not to say anything there, and yet here they are expelling diplomats and talking openly about it.
CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER, SYNDICATED COLUMNIST: I think their case that this is largely political on the part of Obama is true. But that doesn't mean that the Russians weren't behind it and that the U.S. ought to make a strong response.
When you heard Assange say we did not receive our information from a state actor, that's completely meaningless. All they have to have is a single cut out between the Russians and them and they can say that. Of course it came from the Russians. I'm sure it's all in the intel. I think it would be a mistake for us to release this.
But the Trump people are absolutely right. This is our president who appeased the Russians from day one. He cancels the missile defense system as he comes into office, Obama did. He then lies down, does nothing about Syria, essentially nothing about Ukraine, does nothing about all the trespasses of the Russians vis-a-vis the U.S. They learned about the hacking 18 months before today. They do nothing at a time when it would actually have an effect. And then all of a sudden with a month to go, he decides to do this.
The timing and severity of what he did is clearly -- this is Obama's revenge on Trump for the birther thing. Trump, he perceives, Obama perceives, tried to undermine his legitimacy. There's no better way left for Obama to undermine the legitimacy of Trump than to imply -- you're absolutely right. There's no connection to the actual election, but most Americans think this is about the election, to imply that Trump won because of this. That's what all this is about. And that's why I think Trump is right in protesting this. Nonetheless, we as a country can't take our example from Obama as he did for 18 months. We can't let it go. And we should punish the Chinese, and we should next time.
BAIER: So Mollie, that's the question. Let's say the president-elect in this intel briefing this week gets the evidence that he wants to see, specific, whatever that is. And it's tough when you come to hacking about how to track all that down. But let's just say that happens. He tweeted today about Putin deciding not to retaliate and dispatch U.S. diplomats from Russia, saying ""Great move on delay by Vladimir Putin. I always knew he was very smart."" If the evidence is there and it shows Russia's activities, what happens in the Trump administration in the early days about all of this?
HEMINGWAY: That is what makes this so interesting is the context in which this most recent, all these allegations of Russian meddling are taking place. The current administration didn't really do much in face of Russia invading Crimea, meddling in Syria. We had our debacle with the reset. We've had all these problems and no major action was taken by President Obama. And only when John Podesta's email gets phished because he clicks on a link he shouldn't have, then we are elevating the threat. I assume, and I think based on the picks that we are seeing already that Donald Trump has named, such as Rex Tillerson, he hopes for a more nuanced approach with Russia to have some sort of good relationship from which to navigate what is surely going to be difficult months ahead.
BAIER: We should warn that every administration it almost seems in recent memory has wanted to start with a reset or looking into the eyes.
LIASSON: This is something different. Instead of doing what the hill is doing and saying Obama has been weak and feckless on Russia, let's do something really tough, Trump almost seems to be saying the opposite. Putin is a great guy. He's really smart. Maybe I'll life the sanctions on Crimea. He seems to be going totally in the other direction. That's what worries a lot of people.
BAIER: And quickly on North Korea. Trump tweeting out just moments ago about North Korea and saying that ""North Korea just stated that it is in the final stages of developing a nuclear weapon capable of reaching parts of the U.S. It won't happen."" Could that be the early test for this president?
KRAUTHAMMER: If this occurs, if the North Koreans test an intercontinental ballistic missile, that means they could wipe out Los Angeles tomorrow. They could mount a warhead on it. That would be the single most important and threatening action that one can imagine for 2017. When Trump says it's not going to happen, I don't know what he quite means. But if he means a preemptive attack by the United States or something of that sort, we are looking at a crisis of the ultimate proportions.
BAIER: We should be careful. We can't fit a lot on 140 characters there, so we don't know what he means by that. It won't happen, like they have not been successful.
LIASSON: No idea.
KRAUTHAMMER: I'm not saying he's threatening. All I am saying is he's aware of the fact that we are looking at what could be a strategic hinge point in history. That would be really serious. This is an insane regime with the ability to push a button and wipe out a U.S. city. That has never happened. We have had the Chinese, the Russians, but they are not insane. That's quite different. So I think he is recognizing we have an issue. I think he ought to be asked in the next press conference what exactly do you mean by ""It ain't going to happen""?
BAIER: And we will.
Next up, the president's final moves in office, how they may make a successors move to the Oval Office a little more difficult.

SEAN SPICER, TRUMP TRANSITION AIDE: There is a difference between opposing people on policy and allowing the president to have the constitutional right to choose his cabinet as long as they are qualified.

AUSTAN GOOLSBEE, UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO: The broad outlines of what he's about to do are not understood by the American people. And they are in for a rude awakening.
DONNA BRAZILE, INTERIM DNC CHAIRWOMAN: I hear from a number of Democrats that will fight, but there are other Democrats who say, look, put them on the table.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
BAIER: Well, FOX News confirmed there are plans by Senate Democrats to slow walk the confirmation hearings of at least eight cabinet picks for president-elect Trump. And here they are on screen, including the secretary of state designated nominee Rex Tillerson, and there you see the others who may face some challenges from Senate Democrats. They don't have the votes. We are back with the panel. Mollie, they can't stop it from going forward, but they can slow it down.
HEMINGWAY: They absolutely can. It's almost comical, though, that Chuck Schumer puts out this list of eight nominees that he wants to obstruct. Picking one or two would be one thing, but going after eight is completely ridiculous. And it's worth comparing to what happened in the Obama administration. When Obama was inaugurated, the House had approved seven nominees by that day. Another five came through that week. You had Senator John McCain and other prominent Republicans talking about giving Obama the team he needed to get his work done.
There was a lot made of Republican opposition to Obama that people started talking about a few years after Obama took office when he pushed Obamacare through and whatnot. And that is very different than just out of the gate deciding you're going to obstruct.
I'm also not entirely sure it's the wisest course of action for Democrats to take. Rather than picking and choosing a few key areas to oppose him on, this just reflexively hostile approach could give the impression they are being unreasonably difficult for president-elect Trumped. And of course that works out very well for president-elect Trump. He would love to send the message he was still fighting Washington and that he needs more support from the people in order to take these people down.
BAIER: Part of the swamp. Mara, there is this push to list these eight, which seems, as Mollie mentions, kind of strange. I talked to a senior Democrat before the holidays who said we can't get apoplectic about every nominee, otherwise we're going to lose.
LIASSON: My understanding was the Democrats were going to pick and choose their battles. There were some that were important. Pruitt, you want to make an issue out of climate change. You want to ask him questions about that and you want to ask Rex Tillerson questions about climate change and also about Russia because Russia is such a big issue now. You want to find out as much as you can about what President Trump's policy is going to be toward Russia. Who better to ask then Rex Tillerson, secretary of state, who has done a tremendous amount of business there and has been given this order of friendship by Vladimir Putin. That's what Democrats should be focusing on.
BAIER: There are also a number of Democrats up for reelection in 2018 from red states where Trump could push the leverage.
LIASSON: Yes, but I think that the pressure on them comes later. I don't know if it comes so much in these confirmation hearings since Democrats can't stop any of these nominees and won't. I think what they want to do is they want to get information out of them. Certainly they want to find out some financial information because a lot of these candidates haven't put forward their tax returns or their financial disclosures yet. But also they want to try to figure out. Donald Trump has tremendous amount of blanks and his policy. We don't know what he wants to do about Russia or NATO. We know the things he's said, but that's why I think these hearings are going to be important. I don't think -- I think eight is a little bit long of a list, they are not doing anything that different than other opposition parties.
BAIER: We should expect at least one of these cabinet nominees to have something that pops up, at least if you look at recent history. Every administration has had one. Who thought Tom Daschle wouldn't make it through? And he didn't. Your thoughts on all this?
KRAUTHAMMER: I think this is bad strategy on the part of Democrats. Look, they have spent eight years accusing Republicans of being obstructionist, of caring about nothing but stopping the Obama agenda. That stuck to some extent, it hurt the Republicans. And they are now going to start, the Democrats are going to start their tenure in opposition by throwing sand in the gears of nominees who haven't even started. This administration hasn't even begun.
What's the basis for saying you want to stop them when you don't even know what they're going to do? You question the nominees on their plans. You can have a good debate on climate change or the Russians or whatever, but to announce in advance you're going to do everything you can to slow them down so he can get started until March, that's not good for the Democrats. They got shellacked. They have to come up with an agenda. And they can't say we are just here to stop.
BAIER: And latest thing, very quickly, Mollie, the latest push by the left is that President Obama will recess appoint Merrick Garland to the U.S. Supreme Court in the five minutes when this Congress ends and the next Congress comes in. That's 11:55 tomorrow. No way.
HEMINGWAY: I want to say no way. That is such a crazy conspiracy theory to thing that it would happen. I'm a little bit nervous about saying it.
(LAUGHTER)
BAIER: You never know. A lot of things have happened. We will keep you covered either way. Thanks, panel. Next up, your 2017 motivation.
BAIER: Finally tonight, it is January 2nd, 2017. That means that many of you have made the New Year's resolution to get to the gym more, to drop some lbs, to try to get healthier. I know I have. And this is usually the time when you get those online pitches for the latest exercise video or routine, the workout routine.
But we thought we would share this viral video to kick you into some motivation for 2017. Watch this gym-goer attack his elliptical session with serious zeal. He is going to town. Apparently I've been doing it all wrong. This may be my problem. Congratulations to him. Hope he gets those calories going.

0	66	 67 von 72	Fox News Network	January 2, 2017 Monday	 THE FIVE	 5:00 PM EST		"ERIC BOLLING, THE FIVE HOST, FOX NEWS: Hello, everyone. Happy New Year.
DANA PERINO, THE FIVE HOST, FOX NEWS: Oh, my god. That's terrible.
BOLLNG: I'm Eric Bolling along with Kimberly Guilfoyle, Juan Williams, Dana Perino and Greg Gutfeld. Its 5:00 in New York City and this is ""The Five.""
We hope you had a wonderful holiday, 2017 -- yes, there was a little bit of a flop. I know it was kind of fun
GREG GUTFELD, THE FIVE HOST, FOX NEWS: That's the Obamacare of New Year's Eve party favors. 
KIMBERLY GUILFOYLE, THE FIVE HOST, FOX NEWS: Oh my gosh.
BOLLING: Oh, producers. All right, anyway, a new year in America, we'll soon have a new president for the first time in eight years. Big changes are in store for the country, good changes. President-elect Donald Trump has a massive agenda to tackle and he's promised to deliver. We're going to take a look at some of his biggest campaign pledges, starting with a complete overhaul of Obamacare.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT-ELECT: We have to repeal it and replace it with something absolutely much less expensive and something that works where your plan can be tailored. We have to get rid of the lines around the state, artificial lines, where we stop insurance companies from coming in and competing.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
BOLLING: All right KG -- let me get rid of --
GUILFOYLE: Oh, my goodness. I am telling you this should be -- this is like daily excitement for 13-year-old girls. They love all the colors and sparkle.
BOLLING: So, Obamacare. Weeks before the election, Obamacare premiums soared. A lot of people said that was a lot of reasons why President Donald -- presiednt-elect Trump is now going to be president Trump.
GUILFOYLE: Yes, in fact -- yes, very soon. OK, so here's the deal. Obamacare is going to fail and die and fall on its own sword, that's the problem, or on its own mandate, which is the centerpiece, the tent pole of Obamacare keeping it going with the funding because there's not enough like to be able to keep it going.
So unless the president-elect goes ahead and repeals and revises, it's going to die a slow death, which is really problematic to all the people that are signed up for it. So, this is something that has to be done in very quick order to make sure the people are covered with quality choices and quality care for their families.
BOLLING: How quickly can, Dana, can he start on dismantling or replacing Obamacare?
PERINO: Well, I was just taking a couple of notes because I was thinking - - he could start right away and in fact there's a push by some people who say repeal it on day one so, walk from the Capitol when -- as he's sworn in, as he passes by, hand the baton to Paul Ryan and say, OK, now go do your work on Obamacare and get that done on the first day.
I think there is resistance some Republicans who say, now, this is a little more complicated than that especially when, as Greg has pointed out. When you take something away from people, it is harder than giving something new to them. And I think the big question will be what do the Democrats do? So, they have a choice to make. They can sit on their hands and say, we're not going to help you. You want to dismantle it? Fine.
And I don't think that will be possible for them to do for very long because the constituents are going to demand something better. They're not going to be in a better situation in terms of fixing Obamacare and there are so many red state Democrats who are up for election in 2018 that I think that eventually after some hemming and hawing, they will come to the table and try to work on improving their version of Obamacare. If they don't like the repeal and replace, I do think the Democrats eventually come to the table, but it will be ugly.
BOLLING: Juan, would it be wise for the Democrats to come to the table? Obamacare is so widely unpopular. Do they want to be seen as the ones who want to keep Obamacare?
JUAN WILLIAMS, THE FIVE HOST, FOX NEWS: It's not widely unpopular. It's widely unpopular with Republicans specifically but even less so of recent vintage were you see the numbers going up in terms of popularity and the turn out just this past year in terms of people signing up, even during the election, was breaking records. So, there is still a demand. There's a market for it.
The question is about the political promise, Eric and I think the political promise is loud and clear on the Republican side. Repeal Obamacare. But I don't think this is going to happen anytime soon. Dana points out that the Democrats have -- Republicans will need 60 votes.
They'll need Democratic cooperation in the Senate if there is any new law. In addition to which Donald Trump has already said on ""60 Minutes"" there are elements he wants to keep. So, it's going to be a fight.
GUTFELD: You know what, imagine Christmas day and you give some little brat a present and it's like a bicycle. She didn't want a bicycle. She wanted a pony. Try to take that bicycle away from her. Even though she didn't want the bike, she wants the bike.
So, you give a social program or a government program to America even though they claim that they hate it, you don't want to be the anti-Santa Claus that then comes along and says I'm taking it back unless you've got something better to offer and if he comes out with the plan.
And he's going to name it. The no-Obamacare. Going from Obamacare to No- Obamacare and it has, you know, private savings accounts. You can keep your doctors. There's competition across state lines. All of a sudden, it's like this is better than the bicycle. It's a flying bicycle.
BOLLING: Or a pony.
GUTFELD: Or a pony.
BOLLING: Ponycare.
GUILFOYLE: The way your mind works.
BOLLING: How about this one --
(CROSSTALK)
BOLLING: -- and that's where another huge item on the president-elect's agenda, immigration.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
TRUMP: We will build a great wall along the southern border. And Mexico will pay for the wall. On day one, we will begin working on an impenetrable physical, tall, powerful, beautiful southern border wall.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
BOLLING: Big and beautiful.
GUILFOYLE: It sounds attractive.
BOLLING: That's good.
PERINO: So for years, going back two administrations, the idea was to try to do immigration reform in a comprehensive way so that you get everything done because you wouldn't get enough people to come to the table for let's say H-1B visas that you were for border security and vice versa so they wanted to do it altogether.
I think one of the ways Donald Trump would be able to advance his agenda on immigration is to dispel with that thinking and to do it piecemeal and to do border security first. I do think that would actually pass and then try to do some of the other stuff in terms of visas.
BOLLING: Greg, your analogy on the other -- on the Obamacare applies to Republicans on the wall.
GUTFELD: Imagine Christmas morning, and the night -- for weeks you've been promising little Billy a giant wall and he can't sleep at all. And he wakes up in the morning and he opens it up and it's a fence. But I wanted a wall! It's just like a wall but it's a fence. No, it's not. I can tear it apart.
GUILFOYLE: And he threw it.
GUTFELD: So, he's got to come up with something. This is his USP. His unique selling point -- is that what it is, USP. When you get Donald, you get the wall. That's what you expect. So, I don't know how he's going to get around not giving the wall.
BOLLING: KG, I still contend he will build a physical barrier, a wall.
GUTFELD: I think he has to.
GUILFOYLE: Yes.
BOLLING: With the vast majority of the whole southern border being, you know, separated by a wall with Mexicans.
GUILFOYLE: The wall excites me. I like when he talks about the wall. It's big. It's beautiful. It sounds like, you know, a sight to behold. One of the -- we'll make it like the eighth wonder of the world. But here I think it's going to be --
GUTFELD: An even better wall. Remember --
GUILFOYLE: An even better wall, correct. Now, here's the thing. I think it's going to be more complex than that because it will have like quick response teams. It will have surveillance It will have drones. It will have all of these different things encompass so that you have kind of all of the elements to be able to put it together, not just a physical barrier. And he also said they would be a door.
BOLLING: Big, beautiful door.
GUILFOYLE: Like, I hope it's like the door in Trinity College in Dublin, Ireland. They have this gigantic big door like a castle and you have to knock on and hello, let me in.
BOLLING: Can we get in? Hello? Can we get in?
WILLIAMS: Yes, you can get in. You can just fly right over. Everyone else does. But I must say, this is the point where everything starts to collapse. Where Gregory's analogy is the kid goes wild, starts screaming and you say, hey, calm down. It's OK. It's OK. We've got fencing. And we already have drones. And we already have increased border security because we got more border agents.
And then the Republicans on Capitol Hill say, yes, we're going to give you even more border agents, but there's no wall. And they say, well, we can't do a wall. It doesn't make sense. It never did make sense. And then Newt Gingrich says, well, it was just something to get him elected.
And Paul Ryan says, you know, it's just a waste of money. And guess what, Mitch McConnell in the Senate says, you know, it's not on our agenda right now. We have other important things to do.
BOLLING: You imagine how many people you could employ by building a 2,000 -- 800 -- 500 --
GUTFELD: Imagine all the --
PERINO: But that's like Paul (inaudible) argument.
GUTFELD: That's where there's an alien invasion.
(CROSSTALK)
GUTFELD: There's a point here though that it is an infrastructure. Infrastructure -- you could take the undocumented workers and hire them.
BOLLING: This is how you get Mexico to pay for it.
PERINO: And make Mexico pay for that.
(CROSSTALK)
BOLLING: Mexican labors build the wall.
GUILFOYLE: Oh, this is a sign (ph).
(LAUGHTER)
WILLIAMS: Of course, I know --
BOLLING: Before even getting into office, president-elect Donald Trump saved 1,000 jobs or so by negotiating with Carrier to keep its plant in Indiana instead of moving their jobs to Mexico. And he's not stopping there. Mr. Trump says jobs will be the focus of his administration.

TRUMP: We have to stop our jobs from being stolen from us. We have to stop our companies from leaving the United States and with it, firing all of their people.
Companies will come. They will build. They will expand. New companies will start and I look very, very much forward to doing it.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
BOLLING: Surely, Juan, that's pretty cool, right. Keeping jobs in America.
WILLIAMS: I'm all for it. So how's he going to do it? So, his plan it seems to me, at best, because I want to give Donald Trump a chance is you do tax cuts and you do some kind of regulatory relief. And I think that has a chance on Capitol Hill.
The problem is, tax cuts, regulatory relief, guess what, there's a lot of it in place, especially with tax cuts. Then it's a minor expense for big business. That's not comparable to payroll. And if you compare the payroll of Mexico versus the payroll in Texas and Indiana --
BOLLING: Can you just explain that.
WILLIAMS: Yes.
BOLLING: But if I'm saving a dollar on taxes versus having to spend an extra dollar on payroll --
WILLIAMS: Yes.
BOLLING: -- it's the same dollar.
WILLIAMS: No, but I said payroll. Payroll is -- let's say you pay a Mexican worker $3.69 an hour and you pay $30 an hour to the guy up in Missouri. As you're a businessman, that says pretty clearly, I'm moving to Mexico. And Donald Trump can't stop that. What he can do, Eric, he can try to impose some tariffs but that's going to start all kinds of trade wars and problems.
BOLLINF: Dana, your thoughts on the program that Donald Trump is putting together as Juan correctly points out, reducing tax burdens on corporations and even, you know, the punitive damages of fear (ph) attacks.
PERINO: Well, in the Obama administration there was actually nearly an agreement on the rate for corporate taxes. Donald Trump would go lower and I think that's fine, but actually the Republicans and Democrats were hovering around between 25 and 27.5 percent so, you could probably work a deal somewhere there, and I'm all for that. The regulations, obviously that's hampering business so that's another thing you could do.
But the other piece I think that is sort of missing from this idea is the education and job training. One of the things that IBM said was that, yes, we'll keep some jobs here. We'll invest more but we want federal money for job training and retraining for workers whose jobs have been automated, and that would be my third point, which is CEO's, and he wants to be the CEO of America -- CEO's think 10 to 15, 20 years ahead for their businesses.
So thinking that far ahead for America and also the world is that these jobs, just from an efficiency standpoint, will go away as technology improves. So how do you retrain those workers in order to keep jobs in America not from going overseas but from going to robots.
WILLIAMS: Let me just jump in real quick to interrupt to say, on coal, which is his big point, I'm going to bring back coal jobs. Just no way. I just, I mean talk about the Grinch --
GUILFOYLE: You`re a little hung up on that.
WILLIAMS: I don't see how, I mean because --
GUILFOYLE: Why are you throwing so much shade on between coal?
(CROSSTALK)
BOLLING: Do you ever see how much of our electricity usage is fired by coal? About 40 percent.
WILLIAMS: Yes. But do you understand that people are replacing that with - -
GUTFELD: OK, let me use your analogy. Bill, it's Christmas, right?
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes.
GUTFELD: Billy says he wants to a bicycle but he demands that the bicycle be made in America. So Billy's parents go and get the bicycle and it's made in America by robots. The fact is increasing productivity is happening with fewer workers. Even Carrier took the incentives from the deal and invested it in automation, not in jobs. So the biggest job feat is progress. And you can't tax progress because that's immoral.
BOLLING: True.
PERINO: And impossible.
BOLLING: But that's going to happen with or without lower corporate taxe and you still --
GUILFOYLE: Right. There are other things to do to.
BOLLING: Manufacturing -- yes, it's becoming more efficient, but that's where the line of these jobs are going to -- were going to keep according to Donald Trump in America versus going to areas where as Juan correctly points out labor is far cheaper.
GUILFOYLE: Right. So that's what we have to do. We have to create incentive-based programs. There are number of ways to do that. How about lowering taxes? Tax cuts for corporations, reduction in regulatory costs, lower energy costs from increased production in general. We talked about infrastructure jobs. The whole focus and mantra is going to be, yes, America first. Hire in America.
Produce and manufacture in America and make us you know, enticing for other countries to be able to purchase our goods instead of always importing. We want to have friendly trade relations but it's got to be both ways. It's a two-way street. OK, we're going to buy some stuff from China. They got to buy some stuff here too.
And we should be holding on to the American companies. There is something wrong if American companies are feeling squeezed and boxed in and have no other egress but to go out and take their companies and take those jobs out of this country.
BOLLING: We're going to leave it right there. Up next, how president-elect Trump is likely to reshape the Supreme Court, and later, our predictions for this coming year, our resolutions and more. Stay tuned.
GUILFOYLE: Oh my God.
GUILFOYLE: Welcome back. We're taking a look tonight at some of president- elect Trump's campaign pledges as he prepares to be sworn in on January 20th. There is still a vacancy on the Supreme Court that needs to be filled following the passing of Justice Scalia. And there could be other vacancies to come during Mr. Trump's term on office. Here is how he's pledging to put his stamp on the high court.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
TRUMP: We are going to appoint justices of the United States Supreme Court who will uphold our laws and our constitution. The replacement of our beloved Justice Scalia will be a person of similar views, principles, and judicial philosophies. Very important. This will be one of the most important issues decided by this election.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
GUILFOYLE: All right Dana, you made a prediction of this you just --
PERINO: I know, we're going to talk predictions a little bit later in the show, but one of the things that I said --
GUTFELD: Are you predicting that?
PERINO: I will predict that. Thank you. There's another one I can cross --
GUTFELD: I predicted you would say that.
(LAUGHTER)
PERINO: So do you have a list too?
GUTFELD: Yes.
GUILFOYLE: I predicted you would say that (ph).
GUTFELD: I predicted that.
PERINO: So there is Supreme Court vacancy before the election. That was my prediction. I did not know who it would be and sadly it was Antonin Scalia.
So, now you have a situation where the Democrats are going to be in a box. And I have to say that I think most valuable player award on the Supreme Court issue goes to Senator Mitch McConnell who early on under enormous pressure and terrible press coverage was the first to say we will not hold a vote for Merrick Garland, President Obama's Supreme Court choice. We will not do it.
And he just got pilloried in the press and he was right to just hold because now that will go away and Donald Trump will have a chance, I think probably before inauguration to announce who that replacement will be and they'll probably start hearings because it will take a while for that to get done.
GUILFOYLE: Are you calling on yourself because --
GUTFELD: Yes. I think that, you know, we've talked about how this country needs to be unified. What can president-elect Trump do to unify the country? Nominate President Obama to the Supreme Court because he's a lawyer. He would probably look really good in a robe and it would unify the country. If President Trump nominated Barack Obama to the Supreme Court, people would go, oh my God, that's genius. And he would be seen as a wonderful person.
GUILFOYLE: And help Obamacare.
BOLLING: So --
GUTFELD: They do that after that.
BOLLING: So if you have a little brat and you want Obama on the Supreme Court but yet you get, say, Ted Cruz on the Supreme Court --
(CROSSTALK)
BOLLING: Then --
GUILFOYLE: You wish you got the bicycle?
GUTFELD: Yes.
PERINO: You realize the wisdom of that gift later on in your life.
GUILFOYLE: Schwinn Cruiser.
BOLLING: That could be -- look, whoever, you know, Donald Trump put out a list of 11 candidates and all of them are constitutional conservatives. And I think he's going to be -- I think we're going to be pleasantly surprised with whoever he picks. And again, I do think Ted Cruz would make a great Supreme Court justice.
WILLIAMS: I think the worry here is on the Republican side, if you don't get someone like a Justice Souter who came on the court as a conservative and people say, oh my gosh, he's kind of wish he watching (inaudible). They want another Justice Scalia. But remember Democrats have a say in this and that's why it's not the choice, it's not the person that Donald Trump nominates. It's the process. It's the confirmation hearings.
First and foremost, Mitch McConnell -- Dana is absolutely right, I think Mitch McConnell is my winner on Capitol Hill last year because in part he was rewarded for obstructing Merrick Garland by saving the seat for a conservative. But guess what, now that has energized the Democrats to say why would we treat a Republican any differently? They're going to try to slow things down unless Mitch McConnell goes ahead and employs a nuclear option on a Supreme Court nomination and says we don't need 60 votes. It's just going to be a majority.
GUILFOYLE: Yes. It's a very good --
WILLIAMS: And that will blow up --
GUILFOYLE: Change it up for four years
BOLLING: Who push the nuclear option through? Who was that again?
(TECHNICAL DIFFICULTY)
(CROSSTALK)
BOLLING: Well, its Harry Reid will look into this --
WILLAMS: You are confusing --
GUILFOYLE: I'm really sorry Reid is going to be Bolling?
BOLLING: No, I'm not. I'm talking about who brought that --
WILLIAMS: Well, I'm just telling you. That's the rules. Right now as it stands, it will take 60 votes and Democrats are going to stop it.
GUILFOYLE: Yes. OK, little Billy. Another campaign pledge of Mr. Trump, make America safe again. One way to prevent new attacks here at home, keep terrorists out and stop taking in refugees from Muslim countries who can't possibly be properly vetted.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
TRUMP: We should only admit into this country those who share our values and respect our people. The time is overdue to develop a new screening test for the threats we face today. I call it extreme vetting. I call it extreme, extreme vetting.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
GUILFOYLE: It has a ring to it? Extreme vetting, Bolling. Are you all in?
BOLLING: Yes, but my promise -- how extreme can you be when you don't know where the vast majority of the refugees -- not where they're coming from or what their lives were about when they were there, when they were in Syria, Afghanistan, Iraq, Yemen.
They're coming over with no history of, clearly no work histories, no school histories, no criminal record histories and these countries aren't very willing to turn them over to us. So yes, you can extreme vet and try and figure out what they're about now but --
GUILFOYLE: That's the point, unless you can verify and cross (ph) to verify.
BOLLING: Listen, extreme vetting is better than what we have now but we're still -- I mean we are still very vulnerable. Let anyone in that you don't know a history of, you're vulnerable anyway.
GUILFOYLE: Well that's the thing. So Dana, what do you do? There's an obligation for public safety and try to prevent terror attacks. So there is a sense where you have to do your due diligence. You have to properly vet people. You have a responsibility and obligation to do so.
PERINO: All true. And I would agree with all that. It depends on how they decide to do it because he has answered differently depending on the interview, and I think that he recognizes that there are innocent people like the children. He knows they are not criminals, but the parents? Like he doesn't know that.
So anyway, so how they decide to do that, but I would flip the question and say that the United States should have a different policy, posture going forward. That our goal would be to not create or to help prevent refugee crises from happening in the first place, and that is a very different posture for the United States in terms of the last eight years, which would probably cost some heartburn amongst the country and across Capitol Hill, but you solve the problem at its source and then you don't have a refugee problem.
GUILFOYLE: That's part -- very interesting you bring that up because that is very true. You have to preempt to get ahead of the game. But he's also said that you should create safe places and havens for them in their own country and make sure that they can be properly taken care of and really assist and yes, put dollars towards that to be able to do it so that there isn't this migration that is very problematic, fraught with problems in terms of verification in the process. So it's like the two can go hand-in- hand.
PERINO: Agree.
GUILFOYLE: All right, (inaudible). OK, Greg.
GUTFELD: Well, you know, whenever you talk about any kind of vetting, people immediately bring up the idea of profiling. Oh, my god, you're being bigoted and whatnot. It's not really about clothing. It's about doctrine. It's about shared values. It's not about that appearance of how people look but being -- but fearful of appearances that you might appear to be a bigot. You might appear to be racist.
And I think what we're going to see in the future hopefully is more manpower in dealing with this problem and less PC-controlled rules of engagement dealing with vetting that you know what, maybe you've got to take a risk and appear to be, I don't know, discriminating when in fact what you're doing is trying to save people's lives.
WILLIAMS: See, I think there is much more about keeping in constant with who we are as an American people and our values and the Statue of Liberty and welcoming people. And we have a great history of welcoming political refugees, take the Cuban refugees fleeing Castro. If you just get to this country, we will take you in. I think we have to be very careful. Now --
GUTFELD: I was denying that --
PERINO: But he used that against them too.
WILLIAMS: I think that you want to make sure, but where I disagree with Eric is we do so much already. It takes years for people to come through the current vetting process, and I think a lot of this is really a euphemistic language employed by Trump who initially wanted to ban all Muslims who now says, oh, we got to ban people who are coming from territories or states where we know there is terrorist activity.
GUILFOYLE: Well, they should have heightened scrutiny coming from those areas.
WILLIAMS: I agree but I think so much of it already exists.
GUILFOYLE: Well.
GUTFELD: I mean, to your point, there are homegrown terrorists so what do you do about that? You know.
WILLIALMS: That's right.
GUTFELD: Now we're talking about is the origin, the doctrine, the kernel of idea that leads to this.
WILLIAMS: Yes.
GUILFOYLE: Yes. Let's go. Next, 2016 --
GUTFELD: Where we going?
GUILFOYLE: Nowhere with you.
(LAUGHTER)
GUILFOYLE: It was certainly a rough year for Democrats. Will they change their message in 2017? That's ahead.
GREGG JARRETT, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: I'm Gregg Jarrett at the FOX News headquarters in New York.
The sentencing phase begins tomorrow for a man who killed nine people at an historic black church in South Carolina in 2015. Dylann Roof representing himself. He said he will not call any witnesses or present any evidence.
You break it, you own it. That from House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi on Republican plans to repeal and replace Obamacare. President Obama meeting this week with House and Senate Democrats to talk about his signature health care law. President-elect Trump said he might keep parts of it.
Mariah Carey's team tried to explain her performance New Year's Eve. She stopped singing, blaming technical issues. Her reps claimed producers sabotaged Mariah, but the production company calls that absurd.
Stay with FOX News Channel, America's most trusted source for news. I'm Gregg Jarrett.
WILLIAMS: 2016 was the year that many Democrats, including me, gee, we'd like to forget about it. We lost the White House, failed to retake control of the Senate after big losses on election night. So will the party change its message moving forward? Democrats seem mixed on how to regain the trust of the white middle-class, in specific.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
JOE BIDEN, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: You have to talk to them. You have to engage with them. You have to -- you have to go and let them know that you understand their anxieties.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Even our members from the coastal areas recognize that we are not a national party right now. There's -- we can't claim to be.
REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA), MINORITY LEADER: I don't think people want a new direction. Our values unify us; and our values are about supporting America's working families. That is one that everyone is in agreement on. What we want is a better connection of our message to -- to working families in our country.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WILLIAMS: Dana, how do -- how do you hear that?
PERINO: I -- see, it's like, if you were to clean out your closet, and you find that dress that you looked great in 20 years ago.
GUTFELD: OH, yes.
PERINO: And you think, ""I haven't won this in 15 years. Should I get rid of it?"" And I think, ""No. You know what? It could come back in style.""
It just feels like it's the same thing over and over again, and they don't get it. I really don't think they do.
Right before Christmas, Chuck Schumer, the new leader of the Senate Democrats, fired the entire digital video team of the Senate. Many of them had worked there for years. As if they're the problem, as if the message is the problem.
Instead, when I hear Joe Biden say that, I think it's fine to talk differently, but it's the results that matter. If the results were good, then they wouldn't have had a problem. But the results are bad in those areas, and that's why they said they want to change.
WILLIAMS: K.G.
GUILFOYLE: Yes, I mean, it's really true that it's kind of a recipe for disaster, because it just keeps going back to the same cookie recipe. It just doesn't matter.
And what you saw in this election, that the president-elect, Donald Trump, and his team were really sophisticated in terms of their use of social media and other outlets to be able to drive the messaging and also the use of rallies.
When you look at like, the numbers compared to Democrat spending, like 1.2 billion compared to Trump's 560 million. He was able to really monetize, you know, those dollars and those resources for maximum outcome. And they should take a look at that, like an honest look at it and say, ""Wow, this is -- the game has changed now. We could have and should have done better than we did with those dollars."" And they didn't put them to work in the right way that they needed to.
WILLIAMS: Eric, you know, one of the interesting arguments coming out of Democrats in Washington is, ""You know what? Donald Trump is a phenomenon. He's a one-time deal."" And if they change their message, they think, ""You know what? It's not going to do anything if you run into a Trump, but guess what? There's no other Trump coming.
BOLLING: So I'm blown away at the speed of which four years ago, remember, after the Romney loss, the GOP came out with their autopsy. Everyone said, ""Wow, what's going on here? Is the Republican Party on its heels? Have we just now gone completely liberal in the country?""
In one election cycle, the 2016 cycle, it's gone from that to now the Democrats have to perform an autopsy. Have -- have the last ten years or maybe longer, have they become an outdated entity? And I think they have. It's ten years of flat wages. It's ten years of minorities who they're supposed to represent and embrace, underperforming the rest of the economy. Both Africans-Americans and Hispanics.
I mean, so Trump's brilliant line was, ""Hey, what have you got to lose?"" That resonated, and he's right. What did they have to lose? And guess what? I think they'll -- I think everyone will be pleasantly surprised.
WILLIAMS: So Greg, I think this comes down to maybe people. People whose names you might recognize. Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren...
GUTFELD: No.
WILLIAMS: ... Cory Booker. Are they the future of the Democrats?
GUTFELD: No, the future is Oprah.
WILLIAMS: Another celebrity?
GUTFELD: You've got to match star power with star power. And the left has -- liberals have a lot of famous people that are of that -- of that star...
GUILFOYLE: Caliber.
GUTFELD: ... caliber. And Oprah is No. 1, at least in my book.
Look, the overarching answer in terms of message, they have to jettison all the identity buckets and just see what happens. Try it for a month. Or do it for Lent, 40 days of divisive-free rhetoric. Because identity -- when you think about it, identity politics, like all ideologies, are addicting; they're addictive. And the reason why they're addictive is because they provide an answer for everything.
Identity politics, you can say anything, and all you have to say is, ""Well, that's because you're white."" Or ""that's because, you know, it's white privilege."" You can have the -- and that's why it's so easy to do.
So just try it for 40 days. And it can't hurt. Maybe your life will get better. Maybe you'll have more friends. You know? Maybe -- maybe America will fall in love with you all over again.
WILLIAMS: Yes, maybe you could repent for your sins.
Anyway, next, our predictions for 2017. Did our predictions from last year come true? Dana Perino cites (ph). Find out ahead.
PERINO: Welcome back. It's time now for our annual predictions for the new year. If you're wondering how our soothsaying turned out from last year, take a look.
GUILFOYLE: Oh, my God.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
WILLIAMS: I think the power game of the year is going to be vice- presidential selection.
I would guess that Julian Castro, my bet he is part of the ticket for the Democrats going in 2016.
GUILFOYLE: You know it. In just a matter of hours, it is going to be the most amazing New Year's Eve show ever.
BOLLING: I'll make my prediction, as well.
GUILFOYLE: I'm excited.
BOLLING: I'll jump on that one.
PERINO: I believe that there will be a vacancy on the Supreme Court before the election in 2016.
GUTFELD: My prediction and who will fill that vacancy...
PERINO: Yes.
GUTFELD: ... Elisabeth Hasselbeck.
PERINO: Oh.
GUTFELD: That's -- my prediction is, as we know, Elisabeth Hasselbeck has left ""FOX & Friends."" Who will replace her? My prediction will be Donald Trump.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WILLIAMS: Oh, my gosh.
GUTFELD: I was off slightly. Well, he was on ""FOX & Friends"" a lot.
WILLIAMS: I think you were right. I think you got it.
PERINO: Let's start with you, then. What is your prediction for this year?
GUTFELD: I actually have a fairly serious one. I've noticed a rise in non-binary pronouns. These are pronouns that are not ""he"" or ""she"" but like ""ze,"" for people who reject identities. Now we're seeing other kin. These are people who identify as animals and plants.
So my prediction is in identity-specific adaptation, where people are going to identify as other people. Like what could stop me from saying, ""I'm Oprah Winfrey."" If I feel that I'm Oprah Winfrey, why can't I say I'm Oprah Winfrey if that is my identity? If I can choose to be a plant or a kangaroo, or a male or female, or a transgendered flying buttress, why not?
GUILFOYLE: Can you just stick with purple penguin?
GUTFELD: Purple penguin.
PERINO: An interesting prediction.
GUTFELD: Identity-specific adaptation.
PERINO: Kimberly, what do you have?
GUILFOYLE: Well, I predicted it was going to be an amazing New Year's Eve. Wasn't it, Bolling?
BOLLING: It was amazing.
GUILFOYLE: Wow. Wow.
BOLLING: Crushed it. Crushed it.
GUILFOYLE: Let's do it again. Oh, we just did. OK, perfect.
OK, so here's the deal. I'm going to -- I'm visualizing, instead of, like, candy canes and treats and salami, I'm visualizing jobs. I'm visualizing a robust 2017, jobs for people for the working men and women that were left behind. Happy families around the dinner table with money in their wallets.
PERINO: OK, we only have 90 seconds, so Juan, you're next.
WILLIAMS: I think that the confirmation fights early in the year are just going to be spectacular blowups. And my guess is that one of Donald Trump's cabinet picks is not going to make it through the confirmation process.
PERINO: That's typical, though.
WILLIAMS: I would look at Tillerson. I would look at Sessions. I would look at Carson as the leading candidates to fall by the wayside.
PERINO: There's always one that doesn't get through.
Eric.
BOLLING: OK, so with the wave of populism -- Brexit -- nationalism and populism -- Brexit and Trump -- I think it will continue to spread throughout 2017. I think globalism is on its way out, and nationalism will be on its way in, which means trade deals will be renegotiated. And also this one, very importantly. Security deals may be renegotiated. With the trade, I think of NATO -- I'm sorry, of NAFTA, and with the security, I'm thinking of maybe some NATO deals going on.
PERINO: So I feel like my colleagues here played it really safe. They didn't want to go out on a limb. So I'm going to do that. I've got three.
And I am three for three in the year.
GUILFOYLE: You're good at these, though.
WILLIAMS: Yes, really.
PERINO: I believe, No. 1 -- you'll like this -- Kate Middleton will and announce she's pregnant with her third child sometime within 2017.
GUILFOYLE: Oh, good. Didn't you predict this before?
PERINO: I did predict it in 2015.
GUILFOYLE: Thank you.
PERINO: I believe that Angela Merkel will resign before the German election.
BOLLING: Wow.
GUILFOYLE: I think that's a strong pick.
PERINO: Strong prediction.
And the third one, I believe Al that Franken will start to position himself to be the challenger to Donald Trump's reelection in 2020.
WILLIAMS: Wow.
GUTFELD: Are you kidding?
BOLLING: Franken?
PERINO: I believe it.
GUILFOYLE: Now, you've Franken-steined me with your...
WILLIAMS: It would be a -- this will be a ""Saturday Night Live"" election.
GUTFELD: That's a hell of a prediction.
PERINO: So -- I know. Because you know what? I take this segment very seriously.
GUTFELD: You do.
BOLLING: You've been very good at it.
PERINO: All right, next, our resolutions for the new year and a follow-up on how our resolutions for 2016 panned out. Did we stick to them? Stay tuned.
(MUSIC: ""SHE-RA THEME SONG"")
GUILFOYLE: That was...
GUTFELD: Time to reveal our resolutions.
GUILFOYLE: ... kind of a little scary.
GUTFELD: All right, Dana, what's your resolution? Is it the dog?
PERINO: All right. OK, so I'm going to go full robot on you...
GUTFELD: Yes?
PERINO: ... in a way. But actually, what I really want to do is to utilize all the new technology that's available that will make life easier for me. So, like, earlier this year -- this year, well, last year -- Kimberly taught me about the Venmo app.
GUILFOYLE: Thank you.
PERINO: That helped. I just learned how to download the little app so that when I go on the train to go to the airport, I don't have to get a ticket. It's just all right here. I just -- I want to know all of that. I don't want to be the old lady who doesn't know how to use anything.
So you have tips on how my life can be easier with technology, I would love to hear it.
GUILFOYLE: Yes. Starbucks app, Venmo app, AirO or Curve app.
GUTFELD: Get an app app.
PERINO: OK.
GUTFELD: It's an app for your apps. And they have an app for that, too called the App App App. And then there's an app for that, called the App Cubed.
Eric.
BOLLING: Very good. Well done. So they -- all day, like, ""What's your resolution going to be?"" And I'm -- let's do it this way. Hit me up on Twitter and Facebook. Tell me what my resolution should be. Right. A little -- I'll take it. Be critical if you want. How could I be better? I'll take it and read some of them.
WILLIAMS: Do you want me to make a suggestion?
GUILFOYLE: Not more tan.
BOLLING: No.
GUILFOYLE: Not more tan, Bolling. Not more tan. You've got that perfect.
BOLLING: I'd like the audience to tell me how I could be better.
GUTFELD: That is going to be fun.
BOLLING: Certainly.
GUTFELD: I'm going to open up some accounts.
GUILFOYLE: That's it for that, actually.
WILLIAMS: This time -- this time of year, I always start -- I always start with the spiritual. So I think, you know, just kind of being more Christian. I think I'd like to be able to love more people. To just open my heart to more people.
GUILFOYLE: OK. (LEANS IN FOR A HUG)
WILLIAMS: Absolutely. You know that. (HUGS HER)
GUILFOYLE: OK.
WILLIAMS: But...
PERINO: Starts at home.
WILLIAMS: And physically -- but physically my problem...
GUILFOYLE: I wasn't up for...
WILLIAMS: ... I love sugar. I am a sugar guy. I mean, if you put a candy bar, if you put a cake, a cookie...
PERINO: Cookies on election night.
WILLIAMS: So I've got to stop eating sugar.
GUILFOYLE: You like sugar? OK. (GIVES HIM ANOTHER HUG)
WILLIAMS: Oh, my God. More sugar.
GUTFELD: Force some sugar on Juan.
BOLLING: Sugar will kill you, brother.
WILLIAMS: You think so?
BOLLING: Oh, yes.
GUTFELD: Both kinds of sugar.
All right, K.G.
GUILFOYLE: OK, fine. So I am going to be resolution buddies with Dana Perino.
PERINO: Yes.
GUILFOYLE: And we're going to keep each other strong in the new year. And being strong means make life easy.
PERINO: Say no and mean it.
GUILFOYLE: Yes. Say no. Just say no.
GUTFELD: I don't know where this is going.
GUILFOYLE: And then what happens is, you simplify your life.
PERINO: You don't fill up that time with more work.

MADDOW: Thanks, Lawrence.
O`DONNELL: Thank you, Rachel. Well, a lot of people have been wondering this weekend whether Donald Trump committed treason this weekend.
It`s not the first time people have wondered about that online and it`s probably not the last. We have the answer for you and we have the answer to that question of did Donald Trump commit treason?
And we have a model from the past of a presidential candidate in Donald Trump`s situation dealing with a foreign country in a way that people suspect Donald Trump has been dealing with Russia.
All of that coming up.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT-ELECT OF THE UNITED STATES: Hacking is a very hard thing to prove, so it could be somebody else.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: He needs to stop denigrating the intelligence committee, he`s going to rely on them.
TRUMP: And I also know things that other people don`t know. You`ll find out on Tuesday or Wednesday.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Is he holding it out there like some tease for a reality show?
SEAN SPICER, COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR, REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE: I think he does know things, that`s why he`s the president-elect.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Trump does not have any better information than President Obama.
SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R), SOUTH CAROLINA: Putin has hacked into our elections, he`s trying to undermine democracy all over the world.
SEN. JOHN MCCAIN (R), ARIZONA: We will be working for much tougher sanctions against Russia.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: While Trump himself praised Vladimir Putin for not responding in kind.
""Great move on delay by V. Putin. I always knew he was very smart.""
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: He has chosen to side with a murderous dictator, Vladimir Putin, over the patriots who serve our own intelligence services.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: My big fear right now is that he doesn`t appreciate that Russia is a threat to this country.
MCCAIN: The hacking was an attack and we should be treated as such.
TRUMP: Hacking is a very hard thing to prove, so it could be somebody else.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: He needs to stop talking this way.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
O`DONNELL: Treason, it has come to that -- treason. We now have to discuss treason because Donald Trump did something this weekend that we`ve never seen before.
Something that reasonable people think is treasonous. The word ""shocking"" has lost its meaning with Donald Trump.
But I was shocked on Friday afternoon momentarily, anyway when I saw what Donald Trump had done because although the word ""shocking"" has lost its meaning in America, the sensation still exists.
We can still feel shocked, and if we lose that feeling, when Donald Trump does something shocking, that is when Donald Trump will have really finally won.
He will have killed the outrage that is always the proper reaction to the outrageous.
Donald Trump now knows that the way to erase the shock of anything he has said or done is to simply say something else. Anything else.
It doesn`t have to be shocking, it just has to be new. And the news media will latch on to the newest thing Donald Trump has said because it`s new.
That`s why you haven`t heard much about what Donald Trump said three days ago. The news media has processed it and moved on to this.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
TRUMP: I also know things that other people don`t know.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
O`DONNELL: Of course, the president-elect should know things that other people don`t know.
But so far, there`s no evidence that Donald Trump does. And then there`s his refusal to know what everyone else knows.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
TRUMP: They notice any time anything wrong happens they like to say the Russians -- well, she doesn`t now if it`s the Russians doing the hacking, maybe there is no hacking.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
O`DONNELL: Maybe there is no hacking. That`s what he actually said about the stolen e-mails from Hillary Clinton`s campaign chairman John Podesta.
Does that mean that he thinks John Podesta may have just forwarded his e- mails to WikiLeaks?
That is how desperate Donald Trump has been to deflect blame from Vladimir Putin and Russia for these cyber attack that U.S. intelligence officials have concluded was launched by Russia and directed by Vladimir Putin.
After Vladimir Putin decided not to retaliate against the sanctions imposed by President Obama and to delay any response until after Donald Trump is sworn in.
Donald Trump tweeted something that could be a federal crime. A very serious federal crime.
And instantly, Twitter was filled with speculation about that. Did Donald Trump just commit treason? Here`s what he said.
""Great move on delay by V. Putin, I always knew he was very smart."" Now, there is so much to react to in that tweet. But it was the treasonous sound of it that got most attention.
But before we turn to that, just consider for a moment why does Donald Trump think that Vladimir Putin is very smart?
Does he think you have to be very smart to be a dictator who does not allow dissent and crushes, imprisons or murders his opponents?
Invades a neighboring country and oppresses gay people, do you have to be smart to do that?
And in that tweet, the man who thinks he`s the greatest negotiator in the world has said Vladimir Putin is smart to wait to deal with the greatest negotiator in the world.
He`s smart to wait to deal with Donald Trump instead of President Obama. And it`s easy to actually agree with that, but not in any way that`s complimentary to Donald Trump.
Of course, it is smart for Vladimir Putin to deal with Donald Trump if, and only if, Vladimir Putin believes Donald Trump will be easier to deal with because Donald Trump is a weaker negotiator.
Because Donald Trump is a push-over or because Vladimir Putin sees Donald Trump as his very own rodeo clown.
That is the only reason that it could be smart for Vladimir Putin to wait to deal with Donald Trump.
There is no compliment to Donald Trump in that concept, but, of course, that`s one of the many things that Donald Trump doesn`t know.
""Great move on delay by V. Putin. I always knew he was very smart."" Jamil Smith of ""MTV News"" tweeted: ""this is borderline treasonous.
I don`t know what Putin has on this cat, but my Lord, it must be incredible, God help us.""
John Leghem(ph) of Think Progress tweeted: ""I don`t think Trump committed treason with this tweet, but he`s in the neighborhood.""
DeRay McKesson tweeted: ""what`s the threshold for treason?"", and that is the question that Donald Trump`s tweet poses.
It is very possible that Donald Trump will tweet and say and do other things especially in relation to Russia that will provoke this question time and time again this year.
What is the threshold for treason? Everyone at least vaguely remembers something about providing aid and comfort to the enemy, was that tweet aid to the enemy?
Was it comforting to the enemy? Surely Vladimir Putin was comforted by Donald Trump calling him very smart.
But is Vladimir Putin the enemy? Treason is the only crime that is specified in the constitution.
It says ""treason against the United States shall consist only in levying war against them or in adhering to their enemies, giving them aid and comfort."" That`s it.
Treason is levying war against the United States or giving the enemies of the United States aid and comfort.
The United States Supreme Court has come to interpret that sentence to mean giving aid and comfort to our enemies in a declared war.
Which is why no one has been charged with treason in the United States since the last time we were in a declared war, which was World War II.
Without a declaration of war against Russia, Russia and Vladimir Putin would not fit the definition of enemy in the constitution`s definition of treason.
And so, no, Donald Trump did not commit treason because it is virtually impossible to commit treason when we are not formally in a declared war with another country.
That`s why when CIA officer Aldrich Ames was caught selling secrets to Russia, he was not convicted of treason, he was convicted of violating the Espionage Act.
Which brings us to the Logan Act which Donald Trump may have violated.
The Logan Act prevents citizens from carrying on any correspondence or intercourse with any foreign government or any officer or agent thereof with intent to influence the measures or conduct of any foreign government or of any officer or agent thereof in relation to any disputes or controversies with the United States.
That`s what Donald Trump was doing with that tweet. He was clearly communicating with the foreign government and an officer of the foreign government by name, V. Putin.
He clearly intended to influence the conduct of that foreign government in relation to a dispute with the United States.
There is nothing in law that says the Logan Act does not apply to presidents-elect. The Logan Act is, in effect, the one president at a time principle written into law.
With Donald Trump, we frequently say we have never been here before. We`ve entered a new zone with no precedent.
Not this time. In 1968, when he was the Republican nominee for president, Richard Nixon engaged in conduct that the sitting president of the United States Lyndon Johnson privately said was treason.
And now we have new proof published in the ""New York Times"" yesterday of exactly what Richard Nixon did.
In 1968, the Vietnam war was raging out of control to the point that Lyndon Johnson decided not to run for re-election.
Hubert Humphrey was the Democratic nominee, President Johnson was desperately trying to get the South Vietnamese who were -- who we were supporting into peace talks with North Vietnam.
South Vietnam`s president was afraid that Lyndon Johnson would not be tough enough with the North Vietnamese.
And so it was a struggle to get the people we were supporting with money and already with 30,000 American war dead to the peace talks.
Richard Nixon got word to the South Vietnamese through emissaries to resist any peace negotiation.
Nixon feared any breakthrough in the peace negotiations would give the election to Hubert Humphrey.
The broad outlines of this story have been known for years now. The names of the key players have been known.
But what Jack Farrell has discovered and reported in yesterday`s ""New York Times"" for the first time are Nixon`s own words about the scheme, the monkey wrench.
Jack Farrell has found Nixon campaign aide Bob Haldeman`s notes of the conversation with Nixon about the scheme.
Haldeman`s notes, ""keep Anna Chennault working on South Vietnam any other way to monkey wrench it.""
That`s what Nixon said to Bob Haldeman as rumor spread that Nixon might be interfering with the talks.
He got very worried about this, knowing that it was a crime. He called President Johnson and he lied to him about what he was doing when Lyndon Johnson confronted Richard Nixon about this.
(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)
RICHARD NIXON, LATE FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Hello? Mr. President --
LYNDON JOHNSON, LATE FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Yes --
NIXON: This is Dick Nixon.
JOHNSON: Yes, Dick.
NIXON: I just want you to know that I got a report from every person regarding your call.
And I just went on ""Meet the Press"" and I said that -- on ""Meet the Press"" that I had given you my personal assurance that I would do everything possible to cooperate both before the election and if elected after the election.
And that if you felt -- secretary of state felt that anything would be useful that I could do, that I would do it.
That I felt Hanoi -- I felt Saigon should come to the kind of -- to the conference table, that I would -- you felt it was necessary to go there or go to Paris, either one.
I just wanted you to know that I feel very strongly about this and any rumblings around about somebody trying to sabotage the Saigon government`s attitude certainly has no -- actually no credibility as far as I am concerned.
JOHNSON: I`m very happy to hear that, Dick, because that is taking place.
(END AUDIO CLIP)
O`DONNELL: ""That is taking place"", that`s what President Johnson said. He heard Nixon`s excuse, didn`t accept it, told him it`s taking place.
He continued pressing him about what Nixon called sabotage and Richard Nixon said this to President Johnson.
(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)
NIXON: The point that I am making is this, that my God, I would never do anything to encourage Hanoi.
I mean, Saigon not to come to the table, because basically that was what you got out of your bombing pause.
It just got to be marked over in Paris. We`ve got to get them to Paris where you can`t have a peace.
(END AUDIO CLIP)
O`DONNELL: Richard Nixon mentioned their mutual friend Everett Dirksen, Senator Dirksen at the beginning of their conversation, Republican senator.
Lyndon Johnson privately said to Everett Dirksen that this is treason. Those were his words. This is treason.
That`s what the president thought. Everett Dirksen said, I know. Richard Nixon did not just help prolong the war through the election season of 1968.
He kept it going for five years as president costing the United States another 28,000 lives. Joining us now, John Farrell; the author of the upcoming book, ""Richard Nixon: The Life"".
Jack, thank you very much for joining us tonight. Your first interview about this discovery which you just published.
First of all, when is the book coming out? We can`t wait.
JOHN FARRELL, AUTHOR: March 28th.
O`DONNELL: March 28th, OK, I`m going to be at this bookstore. So this -- you have many discoveries in the Haldeman notes and I`d like to get to some more of them.
But I`d like to --
FARRELL: Sure --
O`DONNELL: Concentrate on this for the moment and that feeling in Washington by the president, by Everett Dirksen, by the people who discovered the evidence about this at the time.
Feeling that this was treason. They had never witnessed anything like this.
FARRELL: There`s always been some finagling in American elections with foreign affairs. And Nixon himself had been on the losing end in 1960 when Nikita Khrushchev delayed the release of some captured American pilots in order to keep Nixon and Eisenhower on the Eisenhower ticket a boost in the election against John Kennedy.
So, he also knew that in 1966, Lyndon Johnson had come up with an October surprise in the off-year elections and he was very suspicious that this was being played on him again.
And so he took the steps to prevent it by reaching out through his intermediaries to the South Vietnamese government.
O`DONNELL: And you make the point in your ""New York Times"" report about this that this does look like a violation of the Logan Act.
FARRELL: As far as I read the Logan Act, it sounds like this fits it to a T.
The problem with the Logan Act is that only one person has ever been indicted for it and that person`s prosecution was dropped.
So, it runs against some of the tenets of the First Amendment, and so, it`s been a very difficult law to apply. It gets trotted out and thrown about in charges and counter-charges, but it`s more of a warning.
The best that can be said or maybe the least that can be said is what Henry Kissinger said, which is that if Nixon did this, it was -- it was highly improper.
And Nixon himself in his interviews with David Frost said I would never do that, that would be a terrible thing to do. So, there`s definitely an element of self-consciousness there on Nixon`s side.
O`DONNELL: And then you recounted that Henry Kissinger is one of the people who is communicating to Nixon about the progress being made in the peace talks.
FARRELL: Yes, actually the Haldeman notes that I found while doing the work on the book was sort of exonerating to Kissinger because Kissinger`s advice even while he`s tipping Nixon off is to sit tight.
We don`t know what exactly is going to happen, we don`t know the meaning of this. We know there`s a breakthrough that you could be caught unaware of, so just don`t go out too far on a limb.
Nixon took it just the opposite, Nixon went roaring out on a limb, telling Bob Haldeman to -- and other contacts that revealed in the notes to pressure South Vietnam into what he said holding firm his main envoy, Madam Chennault was captured on an FBI wiretap using almost those exact words to the South Vietnamese ambassador in Washington.
O`DONNELL: At some point Lyndon Johnson was on to this and they actually started putting some surveillance on some of the people who they thought were involved in communicating with the Vietnamese.
FARRELL: Yes, the chain is now -- with these notes the chain is pretty much complete from Nixon to Haldeman and John Mitchell to Anna Chennault to the South Vietnamese ambassador and to Saigon.
The great question that still is out there is how much did this -- how much did this influence the South Vietnamese government which was having its own internal political battles and so how great a chance was lost?
The saddest thing that I found was a note in the Lyndon Johnson library from his national security adviser which said almost mournfully to Lyndon Johnson, this is the best chance we`ve had since 1961 to get out of this mess.
This has been very painful, I`m here with your generals, we think we should go ahead, we think with determination we can make this work.
So, we can look back now and say, boy, those North Vietnamese were incredibly stubborn, this was never going to happen.
But at the time, Johnson and his advisors believed that this was -- this was more than viable, they thought this was a potential breakthrough.
O`DONNELL: And Jack, a final point here. Why didn`t Lyndon Johnson reveal publicly what he knew about this before the election?
FARRELL: They had a long discussion about that, and some of his aides urged him to.
But there were two reasons. The more nefarious reason was that Nixon had been -- not Nixon, but his envoys had been wiretapped and eavesdropped and followed around.
And it would look very bad for an American president to be using the FBI in the late stages of a campaign.
But the practical reason was, and as Clark Clifford told him in this 11th- hour meeting about this when they made the decision not to, was that we really don`t know whether Nixon was personally directing this.
And that`s what the Haldeman notes show was that Nixon was personally giving these orders.
O`DONNELL: And Jack, I imagine you`ve been having some sensations of parallels to what we`ve been seeing this year.
Some Democrats complaining that President Obama should have come out more strongly with what they found out about the Russian hacking, about Vladimir Putin`s involvement.
And a similar reluctance on the president`s part about just how political this might be perceived to be.
FARRELL: Yes, and there are certainly echoes. There was a great picture in the ""New York Times"" a few weeks back, and it was a -- it was a picture of one of the computers that -- servers that had been hacked standing next to one of the file cabinets from the Democratic National Committee that had been broken into during the Watergate escapade in the 1970s.
And it`s very reminiscent in many ways and this idea of flirting with the enemy on the eve of an election is stunning in some ways and in other ways it`s scary.
O`DONNELL: John Farrell, the book is ""Richard Nixon: The Life"" coming out March, say it again?
FARRELL: March 28th.
O`DONNELL: March 28th, it will be at the bookstore. Jack, thank you very much for joining us with this, really appreciate it.
FARRELL: My pleasure.
O`DONNELL: We have breaking Trump transition news now, Nbc News has confirmed that Donald Trump will nominate lawyer Robert Lighthizer to be the U.S. Trade Representative.
Robert Lighthizer served as the deputy U.S. Trade Representative under Ronald Reagan whose trade policies were exactly the opposite of everything Donald Trump has announced to be his own trade policies.
All of the trade agreements that are being complained about now were born during the Reagan era including NAFTA. We`ll be right back.
O`DONNELL: Following up with photos and videos of extremely long customs lines at several major U.S. airports tonight.
The U.S. Customs and Border Protection experienced a nationwide computer system outage forcing international travelers across the country to be processed by hand.
Stephanie Bertini is a correspondent for Nbc 6 in South Florida, she`s live at Miami International Airport. Stephanie, what`s the situation there?
STEPHANIE BERTINI, NBC 6: Well, basically we`re here in a section of the airport where the international arrivals come through.
So, we`re kind of zooming into the area. We`ve been keeping an eye sort of on the door behind the glass here just slightly out of the camera`s view.
That`s where it`s all going down. And there`re some images that we`ve been able to get our hands on from travelers taking to Twitter, pictures that have been sent to us really showing just seas and seas of people.
People waiting and waiting. And what we`ve heard from travelers we`ve spoken to tonight who have actually been able to make it through is that the waits are anywhere from two to three hours.
Now, according to Customs and Border Protection, they`re calling this some sort of a problem, some sort of a power outage.
So, a technical issue with their processing system, and they`re saying that, that is what is affecting sort of the flow of being able to clear people.
And that`s what`s creating all these backlog. They`re saying it`s an issue across the country.
In terms of Miami International Airport, airport officials are telling us there`s been about more than 30 flights and that`s since 6:00 p.m.
So, since the problem erupted, affected by all this. And you know, if travelers are coming through and stopping here in Miami, it`s one thing.
But we`ve spoken to a lot of travelers that were connecting through Miami. So, now they`ve missed their flights to connect to their final destinations.
So, that`s really created a problem, a lot of frustration in this airport tonight -- Lawrence?
O`DONNELL: Nbc 6`s Stephanie Bertini, thank you very much for joining us live from Miami, really appreciate it, thank you.
Coming up next, President Obama coaching the Democrats on how to deal with Donald Trump.
O`DONNELL: The 115th Congress will be sworn in tomorrow and the Trump resistance will officially begin on one side of the aisle.
President Obama will go to Capitol Hill on Wednesday to talk with Democrats about how to protect his landmark healthcare law, the Affordable Care Act against a Republican-led Congress that promises to repeal it.
And a president who promises to sign that repeal. Next Tuesday, President Obama will go to Chicago and give a farewell address where he will, ""offer some thoughts on where we all go from here.""
At his new year`s eve party at Mar-a-Lago, Donald Trump told his guests what he will do when he takes office.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
TRUMP: Taxes are coming down. Regulations are coming off. We`re repealing Obamacare.
(CHEERS)
(APPLAUSE)
We`re going to have strong borders so that when people come into the country, they`re going to come into the country legally, which is the way we want it.
We will build the wall, you know that. We will build the wall.
(CHEERS)
(APPLAUSE)
(END VIDEO CLIP)
O`DONNELL: Joining us now, Michael D`Antonio; Pulitzer Prize-winning writer and author of the new book ""A Consequential President: The Legacy of Barack Obama"".
And Karine Jean-Pierre; senior adviser and national spokesperson for MoveOn.org.
Karine, the striking thing to me in that video, and this is really unusual for a Republican audience, especially a rich Republican audience which was that group.
They got a little bit of applause for taxes are going down but he brought the house down by saying we`re going to get rid of Obamacare.
That got the biggest applause, not one person in the room has interacted with Obamacare in any way. Not one of them.
They`re all cheering for the removal of health insurance from millions of people who can`t afford it and that was their biggest cheer of the night.
And it seems that pressure is on Donald Trump to deliver on that repeal.
KARINE PIERRE-JEAN, SENIOR ADVISER & NATIONAL SPOKESPERSON, MOVEON.ORG: No, that`s exactly right, Lawrence.
And don`t forget, I actually don`t know if it`s been really reported that much, is that he also made about $500,000 off of that new year`s eve event.
His Trump organization did. And so the thing, too, to look at for the next couple of weeks is also how is the -- how are the Republicans going to deal with Donald Trump?
Because a lot of Donald Trump`s rhetoric will bump against what Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan have listed that long list of policy ideas that they`ve had for very far-right ideas that they`ve had for many years.
Because if we look at, in particular, Medicare and also Social Security, Donald Trump has said during the campaign, I don`t want to touch those.
But that`s pretty much on the list for McConnell and Paul Ryan. So, we`ll see how that goes.
But I think at the end of the day, Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan will certainly tramp Trump`s fake populism that he played during the 18 months of his campaign.
O`DONNELL: Michael, your new book, ""A Consequential President: The Legacy of Barack Obama"".
First of all, a quick outline of what you think is the essence of the consequential president, his achievements. And then also what you now see as the risk to his legacy with the Trump presidency.
MICHAEL D`ANTONIO, AUTHOR: Well, I think the theme of hope that he started with in 2007, 2008, is really the capstone of his legacy. When you look around the world, it`s not just Americans who took hope from his election and from his dignified and decent presidency. It`s people all over the world who saw America as something different than it was under George Bush.
The fact that a man named Barack Hussein Obama, an African-American man, could be elected in the United States of America to the highest office was inspiring to all. You know, and I think that`s why there were hundreds of thousands of people in Grant Park cheering his election on the night of on the night of his election. I think this is really the image that people are going to carry forward.
And then you look at all of his accomplishments in his very first year of saving the economy, pursuing health care, saving the auto industry. There are so many things that he accomplished so quickly that this legacy, you know, it can`t be erased by a single President Trump and it can`t be erased by a single congress.
O`DONNELL: So, Karine in Michael`s view the legacy is not simply the affordable care act which I believe has many more procedural hurdles that it will have to get over to be repealed than the republicans are acknowledging. There`s no version of this where you can repeal it in one day. That isn`t legislatively possible.
KARINE JEAN-PIERRE, SENIOR ADVISOR/NATIONAL SPOKESPERSON, MOVEON.ORG: No, that`s exactly right. It is going to be very difficult. I mean, in many ways the republicans are like the dog that caught the car on this one. They had six years to actually work with democrats. I mean, democrats have said the president, himself, even Hillary Clinton on the campaign trail said, hey, you know, it needs to be fixed.
And even with the minor fixes the past six years, the republicans refused to do it and so now they`re put in a situation where millions and millions of Americans who rely on this could be in the harm`s way because they`re so stuck to their partisan idea of repealing Obamacare.
O`DONNELL: Karine Jean-Pierre, thank you very much for joining us tonight. Appreciate it.
JEAN-PIERRE: Thank you.
O`DONNELL: Coming up next, when do you call a lie a lie? When you are reporting on Donald Trump?
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT-ELECT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: When the World Trade Center came tumbling down and I watched in Jersey City, New Jersey, where thousands and thousands of people were cheering as that building was coming down.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
O`DONNELL: Lie? Not a lie? Donald trump has inspired a debate about lying that has been going on for over a year. His lies during the presidential campaign including the lie that thousands of Muslims in New Jersey cheered on 9/11 have been a central part of that debate, how can journalists fairly describe these statements? What should they call them? According to an analysis by Politico in September, Donald Trump averaged about one falsehood every 3 minutes and 15 seconds over a 5-day period during the campaign. The New York Times used the word, lie, for the first time in September to describe Donald Trump`s birther statements.
Yesterday, Wall Street Journal Editor In Chief, Gerard Baker was asked by Chuck Todd on Meet the Press whether he is comfortable using the word, lie, to describe an outright falsehood by Donald Trump and he said this.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
GERARD BAKER, WALL STREET JOURNAL EDITOR IN CHIEF: I`d be careful about using the word, lie. Lie implies much more than just saying something that`s false. It implies a deliberate intent to mislead. I think it`s perfectly - when Donald Trump says thousands of people we`re on the rooftops of New Jersey on 9/11 celebrating. Thousands of Muslims were there celebrating. I think it`s right to investigate that claim, to report what we found which is that nobody found any evidence of whatsoever.
And to say that, I don`t - I think its then up to the readers to make up their own minds to say this is what Donald Trump says, this is what a reliable trustworthy news organization reports. And you know what I don`t think that`s true. I think you can start scribing a moral intent as it were to someone by saying that they`ve lied. I think you run the risk that you look like you are being - you`re not being objective.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
O`DONNELL: Joining us now, Jonathan Alter an MSNBC political analyst and a columnist from Daily Beast. Back with us Michael D`Antonio. Jonathan your verdict on the 9/11 thousands of Muslims celebrating in New Jersey, do you call it a lie if not what do you call it?
JONATHAN ALTER, MSNBC POLITICAL ANALYST: I call it untrue and a falsehood. I`m not sure it was a lie because it in Trump`s fantasy mind he might have believed it. He believes all kinds of conspiracy theories even that of Reddit, online somewhere and believed the lie as a - so repeated a lie but I think a lie is more like when he said, you know, Hillary Clinton wants to abolish the second amendment.
That`s something he knows it`s a lie he`s telling. Or if he says I can`t release my taxes because I`m under audit. He knows that`s a lie. There are certain more clear cut lies. We don`t want to call every falsehood that comes out of his mouth a lie or we`ll just be going lier, lier, lier all day long and we would debase the currency of calling him to account. What I really objected to about what Gerard Baker said, he said ""at the risk of losing our impression of objectivity.""
He has put objectivity and balance at the very top of journalistic values and at the top of our values, at the top of our hierarchy of values is true. Balance and objectivity are little further down below truth and accuracy. And we`ve - you know, the constitution didn`t protect the right to be objective. There was no objective press in those days, it was the right to challenge and hold the government accountable with the truth.
And I think we`ve lost sight of that in the business.
O`DONNELL: But Michael could you hear Baker to be saying about the objectivity? The reason why I want to preserve the image of objectivity is so that I can get you to believe that what I`m trafficking in here at this newspaper is truth?
D`ANTONIO: Well, and this is the trap that Trump puts everybody in. So he demands that we adhere to a higher standard than -
O`DONNELL: Yes.
D`ANTONIO: -- he`ll follow so he`ll lie and he does lie. I mean, I would sort of feel like the second time he says it, once he`s been corrected about the Muslims on buildings, rooftops celebrating, then it`s a lie. And I think what he said about abolishing the second amendment -
O`DONNELL: But do you think journalists -- even if it`s a lie, even if you agree it`s a lie, as an editor, would you think journalists can overuse it to the point where lie becomes an ineffective term?
D`ANTONIO: Oh, yes. I mean we have this - we do need to assert our institutional value -
O`DONNELL: I mean, use it accurately.
D`ANTONIO: Yes.
O`DONNELL: But you`re using it, you know -
D`ANTONIO: Because you`ll lose your reader, you lose your viewer.
O`DONNELL: Yes, right.
D`ANTONIO: And then they don`t trust you. So then, Donald has us all lumped in to this untrustworthy world where nobody is certain of anything and then what institution can the public trust?
O`DONNELL: Now you spent a lot of time with him up close doing a book. You must have had moments where you thought this is lie, this is a fantasy.
D`ANTONIO: Oh, yes, yes.
O`DONNELL: This is -- he`s just winging it, he might think it`s true, it might not. I mean --
D`ANTONIO: He`s either deluded or he believes a conspiracy theory, I think he`s very much a fan of certain conspiracy theories or he just likes to assert things as if they should be true and if he says it often enough, it will become true.
O`DONNELL: Let me give you an example of something that`s also 9/11 that let`s see what we think about this in terms of lie. Let`s listen to this first one from the republican debate in February.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
TRUMP: How did he keep us safe when the world trade center -- the world -- excuse me, I lost hundreds of friends.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
O`DONNELL: So that`s -- he lost hundreds of friends on 9/11. The next morning on Meet the press, listen to how he said the same thing.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
O`DONNELL: I was there. I lost many, many friends in that tragedy. That was the worst tragedy in the history of the country. Worst than Pearl Harbor because they went - they attacked civilians - they attacked people in office building.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
O`DONNELL: So hundreds of friends in less than 12 hours became many, many friends. And here`s the important thing. He never said it again. And on the night of the debate when he said it, I tweeted immediately that he was lying. In fact, no one lost hundreds of friends on 9/11. The math of that tragedy is such. He never went to a single 9/11 funeral. I mean, there couldn`t have been anything in his wildest imagination that was true about that when he said it, could there?
ALTER: No. But there isn`t about a lot of things that come out of his mouth. What we need to develop, Lawrence, are a new set of journalistic conventions and phrases to indicate -
O`DONNELL: Yes.
ALTER: -- so we need to say routinely his lie is so inflammatory that the president`s statement was unsubstantiated. The president`s statement was unfounded. President`s statement was false.
O`DONNELL: Is untrue ok? Is that something softer than lying?
ALTER: You know, I think untrue is a good word also.
O`DONNELL: Yes.
ALTER: These are ways that are more digestible for the public to indicate that the president is speaking with a forked tongue.
D`ANTONIO: I think to say there`s never been any evidence offered to support the president`s claim. I mean there`s
ALTER: Right.
D`ANTONIO: I mean there`s so many ways to get at this that also indicates that we`ve done our due diligence.
O`DONNELL: Ok. But on twitter, I`m sticking with lie because it`s three characters. It`s what I got to do. Jonathan Alter and Michael D`Antonio, thank you both for joining us. I really appreciate it.
D`ANTONIO: Thanks, Lawrence.
O`DONNELL: Coming up, the most surprising moment of the NFL season happened yesterday and it had nothing to do with football.
O`DONNELL: Two people protesting the Dakota Access Pipeline on behalf of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe climbed into the rafters during the U.S. Bank Stadium in Minneapolis during the Minnesota Vikings game on Sunday dangling from ropes high above the playing field. The protesters unraveled a large banner that said U.S. Bank divest, no D-A-P-L. The protesters displayed the banner in the second quarter and police did not attempt to remove them. The banner stayed up until the game was over.
The protesters were then arrested. A statement released by the protesters said that U.S. Bank has given $175 million line of credit to Energy Transfer Partners, the parent company of the pipeline. Goes on to say January 1st marks the original deadline for the completion of the pipeline. Today the pipeline is still incomplete. Investors have a right to withdraw business contracts from the project and we urge them to do so. President Obama blocked construction of the pipeline on December 4th. The worry President-Elect Trump could reverse that order so they`re focusing on companies that are financing the pipeline. Some companies have divested. Guardian Newspaper reports in November the largest bank in Norway, DNB, announced it had sold its assets in the pipeline and Odin Fund Management, major Norwegian fund manager sold $23.8 million worth of shares invested in companies behind the pipeline.
Earlier in December, the Swedish bank Nordea said it would not back the pipeline if the corporation violated the demands of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe. U.S. Bank is not commenting on whether it will divest. In a statement to The Last Word, Standing Rock Sioux Tribe Chairman Dave Archambault said oil prices have dropped and production from the Bakken fields have declined significantly. This means on top of everything else, there is no economic rationale to increase the regional pipeline capacity. It is simply the pipeline company`s greed. Chairman Archambault continues while we are not directly associated with all of the divestment protests, the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe agrees with the push to get more people to divest from the Dakota Access Pipeline.
Coming up, Malcolm Nance reacts to the latest terrorist attack in Turkey and Donald Trump`s comments about it.
O`DONNELL: We have more breaking news about the problem at U.S. airports tonight. U.S. Customs and border protection says the breakdown of its computers systems has been fixed. All systems are back online and they are processing travelers now as quickly as possible. It will still be a long wait but your loved ones will be home soon. We`ll be right back.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT-ELECT, UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: Many, many, many people killed. it`s a horror show. So we`re going to get things running properly.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
O`DONNELL: Malcolm Nance will join us next.
O`DONNELL: Tonight authorities in Turkey had been carrying out raids in Istanbul as part of the investigation of the terror attack in the early hours of New Year`s Eve. Officials released this picture of the suspect in that attack who they say carried out a mass shooting at a well known nightclub. 39 people were kill and dozens others injured. The Turkish government it has found or believed to be the gunman`s fingerprint and police are close to identifying him. Today ISIS made a rare move and claimed responsibility for the shooting calling the gunman a Soldier of the Caliphate and the attack revenge for Turkish Military involvement in Syria. Joining us now, Malcolm Nance, MSNBC counterterrorism and intelligence analyst. Malcolm, your reaction to what happened over the weekend and Donald Trump`s comments about it.
MALCOLM NANCE, MSNBC CONTRIBUTOR: Well first off, Turkey has suffered many, many terrorist attacks over the last year which have killed almost 200 of its citizens. Most notably, the attacks in Ankara at the airport -- I`m sorry, Istanbul at the airport where they lost almost 50 people, by the same type of people, Uzbeker or Turkish (INAUDIBLE) nationals who were members of the Islamic state terrorist group. That being said, it is virtually impossible for intelligence, even with advanced intelligence and some knowledge of the plot, which is appears there were indicators of, to stop every act of terrorism. Donald Trump`s comment just, again, reveals his naivety. There`s no way you can constantly promise you`re going to take care of this when you can`t get into the mind of a single individual who could be inspired to attack.
O`DONNELL: And so when he sees something like this and as you say, there`s a history to this in Turkey, there`s a repetition to it. We -- what assets, what could we bring to Turkey following Donald Trump`s logic that could somehow affect the future of this kind of thing in Turkey?
NANCE: Well, technically, we`ve already done possibly the maximum that we could do in terms of bringing cooperation, technical intelligence, you know, using strategic collection assets, even tactical collection assets that are on the ground which may have given the American intelligence agencies up to two weeks warning that this attack was going to occur. It appears that there`s reports that they had warned the owner of the Reina Nightclub that facility would be attacked but you can`t choose the place and the time of the terrorist leader who just decides to do it on a random night if you don`t actually heed that warning or put out enough security. So for the most part, we are doing maximum effort. now, possibly Trump could, you know, get into a relationship with Erdogan and provide more on- the-ground intelligence assets but that wouldn`t go over well certainly politically and Erdogan, himself, he has his own political games that he`s playing internally that prohibit more United States participation.
O`DONNELL: What do you expect Turkey`s reaction to be?
NANCE: Well, Turkey`s reaction is going to be -- is pretty predictable, if we`re going to watch the trend they`ve had over the last year. Since the coup d`etat we expect Turkey is going to ignore the Islamic State or the ISIS claim that they carried out this terrorist attack and they`re going to use it to bash their opponents in the Guhelinis camp or the Guhelin organization (INAUDIBLE). He`s the exile who lives in Pennsylvania and by doing that they will just further ostracize the Turkish people and give the Islamic State an opportunity to attack again.
O`DONNELL: Malcolm Nance, thanks for joining us tonight, really appreciate it. MSNBC`s live coverage continues now into ""THE 11TH HOUR""."
0	68	 69 von 72	MSNBC	January 2, 2017 Monday	 THE RACHEL MADDOW SHOW	 9:00 PM EST	"HIGHLIGHT: There`s an intertwined threads of an Indonesian corruption scandal, an American mining company, and the business conflicts of Donald Trump and a new member of his administration, Carl Icahn.

"	"RACHEL MADDOW, MSNBC HOST: Good evening, Ari. I want to thank you in particular for all you did to fill and hold things together last week. It was great. Thank you, my friend.
ARI MELBER, MSNBC CORRESPONDENT: Great. Thank you. Happy New Year.
MADDOW: Thanks.
And thanks to you at home for staying with us for the next hour.
It was really nice to have a few days off. It is really, really nice to be back. I keep running into old friends and family members and people on the street and people like, you know, out on the dog walk and stuff. People want to talk to me about politics. They say with concern in their eyes, how are you feeling about 2017?
And I found myself by the end of my vacation saying, I`m really excited for 2017. I am. My job is to explain stuff. And oh, my God, is that a good job to have this year already? 
Case in point, this story is amazing. And it starts with copper, the mineral copper. There`s copper in brass. There`s copper in bronze. The Statue of Liberty is sheathed in a layer of copper. That`s about the thickness of two pennies.
Pennies themselves used to be copper, but now they`re just copper-covered zinc, which sort of seems sad. But it makes financial sense, because copper over time became too valuable to use in something as cheap as a penny, because most of what we use copper for now is conducting electricity. We use copper for wiring. There is a massive global appetite for copper.
And the world`s largest producer of copper is an American company. It`s a company that used to be based in New Orleans but now the mining company Freeport is based in Phoenix, Arizona. And the Freeport mining company of Phoenix, Arizona, they do still mine copper in Arizona and they mine copper in New Mexico and in Colorado. But they are a gigantic firm. And they`re a global operation.
In South America, they mine copper in Chile, and in Peru. In the Democratic Republic of Congo, they mine cooper and also cobalt. In Indonesia, they operate the largest gold mine in the entire world, which is also the third largest copper mine in the world, which is also a huge silver mine as well.
This is an American company, but the physical footprint that Freeport has in Indonesia, it isn`t just visible from space. It`s easily visible from space. It`s massive. Their mine in Grasberg, which is in Papua province in Indonesia, it`s basically a massive upside down mountain. It`s almost a half million acres.
They first discovered mineral wealth there in the 1930s when it was a Dutch colony. By the 1970s, Indonesia was an independent country and that mine at Grasberg was one of the biggest open pits in the world.
Among the many products and byproducts of that mine are, of course, all that silver and copper and gold. Also hundreds of millions of tons of mining waste that they have dumped in the surrounding jungle and rivers. That environmental damage associated with that giant mine is one of the things that mine is most famous for around the globe.
But it is also unappreciably massive, both geographically and economically. Freeport`s operation in Indonesia is so big, that in Indonesia that company is the single biggest taxpayer for the whole country.
And it`s not like Indonesia is some rinky-dink country, right? Indonesia has 260 million people. The biggest countries on earth by population are China first, then India, then us, then Indonesia. Indonesia is ginormous.
But of all the 260 million people in Indonesia, its biggest tax payment every year comes from Arizona, comes from this American company. It`s just huge.
In our presidential election this past year, do you remember when Indonesia had a weird little cameo role? It was in the Republican primary. It came up. It was so strange, so unexpected, so not just inexplicable but unexplained.
At the time and until now, it didn`t ever make sense until now. And I love it when a story like, you know, doesn`t make sense for a year, and then all of a sudden, it does. It rarely happens when you get it so clearly, like light dawns on marble head, oh, that`s why that happened. But in this case, light dawns on marble head, now we get it.
It started off strangely with no explanation. It was last September, September 2015. So, that was just a few months into the start of the Republican primary. The Donald Trump candidacy had started in June of 2015, and it was almost, honestly, treated as a joke from the beginning. I mean, his supporters can crow about that now, and they do, but at the time it was treated mostly as a joke.
And there were some funny things, some laughable things about the launch of the Trump candidacy, up to and including reports that the candidate had to hire extras, he literally had to pay actors to pretend to be his supporters at his day one announcement at Trump Tower.
But however soft and even silly his candidacy seemed at the very start, it caught fire for real very quickly, so much so that by the fall of 2015, the Republican Party was already worrying openly about Donald Trump`s poll numbers. He was definitely leading. And the were worried that even if one of their more normal candidates could beat Trump to get the nomination, they were worried that he was showing such support in the polls, maybe he might bolt the Republican Party and run as a third party, an independent candidate against whoever the Republican nominee was.
And so, in the fall of 2015, this was a real worry, real concern, moderators at the debates, and then ultimately the party itself, they started asking all the Republican candidates to make a pledge, to pledge that they would support whoever the party ended up nominating. And there was a little question as to whether the other candidates would really pledge to definitely do that, because there was a chance that Donald Trump might become the nominee and would they all be comfortable making that pledge.
There was a little question about that, but mostly the Republicans were worried about Trump himself. Would Trump make a pledge like that? Would he really pledge, not just to not run as an independent, but to wholeheartedly support whoever the Republican nominee was, even if it was somebody like Low Energy Jeb Bush or Lyin` Ted or Little Marco?
I mean, the Republican Party was very worried about that, because initially the answer from Trump was that he would make no such pledge.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
DEBATE MODERATOR: Is there anyone onstage, and can I see hands, who is unwilling tonight to pledge your support to the eventual nominee of the Republican Party and pledge to not run an independent campaign against that person? Again, we`re looking for you to raise your hand now. Raise your hand now if you won`t make that pledge tonight.
Mr. Trump.
(BOOS)
So, Mr. Trump, to be clear, you`re standing on a Republican primary debate stage --
DONALD TRUMP (R), THEN-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I fully understand.
DEBATE MODERATOR: -- he place where the RNC will give the nominee the nod.
TRUMP: I fully understand.
DEBATE MODERATOR: Just to be clear, we`re going to move on, you`re not going to make the pledge?
TRUMP: I will not make the pledge at this time.
DEBATE MODERATOR: All right.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
MADDOW: That was August 2015. Major point of contention in the Republican Party. Major point of contention at the Republican debates. Lots and lots of drama around that issue.
All the other candidates say, yeah, I`ll make the pledge. But Donald Trump for a long time would not. And that is why it was genuinely a big deal. It was the resolution to something around which there was a lot of tension. It was a big deal when on September 3rd, Donald Trump changed tack, finally announced that yes, he would sign this pledge.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
TRUMP: I have signed the problem.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
So I will be totally pledging my allegiance to the Republican Party and the conservative principles for which it stands. And we will go out and we will fight hard and we will win.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
MADDOW: He signed it. He signed the pledge. I have signed the pledge.
It sort of feels like a silly turn in the campaign, now looking back at it. But at the time, it was a big deal in the Republican primary.
And there were two things that were weird about it when it happened. The first one was when he held up that piece of paper, everybody could see that the date on it was wrong. It was September 3rd, not August 3rd. So, that was kind of weird, the date was wrong.
The second thing that was strange was, hey, what`s this random Indonesian guy doing there for this announcement? It was a weird moment at the time and it really made no sense until now. We`re having one of those moments when something that previously made no sense, makes sense.
Watch this. This is what happened that day. This is how Donald Trump, he wrapped up, and then restarted his press conference about signing that silly Republican pledge. It was so weird at the time. Watch.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
TRUMP: Thank you, everybody. Thank you. Thank you.
(APPLAUSE)
Hey, ladies and gentlemen, this is a very -- an amazing man. He is, as you know, right, speaker of the house of Indonesia. He`s here to see me. Setya Novanto, one of the most powerful men and a great man and his whole group is here to see me today. We will do great things for the United States; is that correct?
SETYA NOVANTO, INDONESIAN POLITICIAN: Yes.
TRUMP: Do they like me in Indonesia?
NOVANTO: Yes, thank you very much.
TRUMP: Speaker of the house in Indonesia. Thank you very much.
(APPLAUSE)
(END VIDEO CLIP)
MADDOW: That was such a random moment in the presidential election, right? Such a random moment in the Republican primary.
Press conference is over, he convenes this press conference to announce he signs this pledge, holds the pledge up with the wrong date on it, does a press conference about that, ends the press conference, thanks everybody, thanks everybody, walks away, then comes back to the podium, starts up the press conference again to tell everybody how awesome it is that he`s meeting with his friend, the speaker of the house of Indonesia. His whole group is here to see me today. We will do great things for the United States, won`t we?
It was weird at the time, totally inexplicable. Well, now, we get it. Because that was last September, September 2015. Donald Trump was doing Donald Trump business that day. His presidential campaign was only a few months old. The Indonesian speaker of the house was there meeting with him at Trump Tower that day to talk about Trump`s business dealings in Indonesia, a planned golf course and planned hotel.
Since then, that guy, the Indonesian speaker of the house, has gotten into and out of a lot of trouble, because that company I was talking about, that`s the largest taxpayer in Indonesia, that mining company that operates a giant open pit mine that`s the largest gold mine in the world and you can see it from space, that company with those huge holdings in Indonesia, one of their executives met in Indonesia with that same politician who we just saw with Donald Trump, and he secretly taped him. Secretly taped him trying to shake down the mining company for $4 billion.
That mining company, Freeport, their contract to operate in Indonesia runs out in 2021, runs out in four years. They would very much like to extend that contract. They have a big new underground mine that they want to build there too along with their biggest gold mine in the world.
And that politician, that Indonesian speaker of the house, the guy who was standing there with Trump who got introduced at that press conference, that politician was caught on tape telling the mining company that yeah, he could get them an extension of their contract, in fact he could get them a 20-year extension of that contract with the Indonesian government, they could get a deal to operate in that country until 2041, if they could provide him with a little something. They would have to hand over 20 percent of the company, shares worth roughly $4 billion.
He said they could hand that over, what do we call it, an administrative fee? They would have to hand that over through him. He would pass the money on to the president and vice president of Indonesia. And that is how Freeport could get their new contract with the government of Indonesia.
It`s a classic shakedown, right? And it was caught on tape. And the tape went public in Indonesia just a few weeks after Donald Trump inexplicably introduced this guy to the American press corps during the Republican primary in the lobby of Trump Tower when he was making that announcement about the stupid pledge.
And here we`re all like, who`s that guy? In Indonesia, that`s one of the most powerful politicians in that huge country. And he`s caught red handed and it`s on tape, and the tape goes public. Huge scandal.
The tapes were lurid. They were played over and over again in the Indonesian media. By December of that year, by December 2015, three months after he had that weird meeting with Trump that nobody understood, that guy, the speaker of the house in Indonesia, forced to resign in the midst of this scandal.
And then over the course of the ensuing year, things got even more wild than that. He was facing this ethics tribunal for this caught on tape corruption scandal. But then the tape itself got ruled inadmissible as evidence before the tribunal. And this guy was powerful enough and connected enough that even though he had had to resign in disgrace, even though everybody had heard the tape, right after our election in November, this past November, they actually returned this guy to power as speaker of the house again.
And now two things have happened that sort of make us understand our new world. Two things have happened that make this all make sense. Number one is that the Trump organization has just confirmed to ""The New York Times"" that Donald Trump`s new real estate deals, that golf course he wants to build, that resort he wants to build, the Indonesian resort deals that brought this politician to Trump Tower in the first place, Trump Organization has just confirmed to ""The New York Times"" those deals are on. Those projects are moving forward.
Remember when Donald Trump said right after he was elected that there would be no new deals by the Trump organization now that he`s president-elect? There are new deals that are absolutely under way in West Java, that`s the golf course, and in Bali, that`s the hotel. Must be nice to have a very powerful politician like the country`s speaker of the house helping you out with real estate deals like that. And what does the Indonesian speaker of the House get out of this deal? The man who was caught on tape trying to squeeze $4 billion out of that gigantic American mining company, that`s the largest taxpayer in his country?
And that brings us to the final piece of this, which is apparently how it`s going to work in our country. We`re used to reading about how stuff works like this, like, you know, autocratic leaders who have been in power for decades, and their extended families who own more wealth than the rest of the country combined, right? Politicians who get caught for corruption in big foreign companies and how deals get done that helped people with the right connections, right? I mean, we`re used to reading about this in like terrible human rights reports on countries that end in ""stan.""
But now, we get an American chapter of this story, because the last piece of this is that just as this speaker of the house in Indonesia gets reinstated, after his corruption charges get thrown out on a technicality, just as this speaker of the house helping Donald Trump with his real estate deals gets put back in power, and just as those deals that will enrich the next American president personally, just as those real estate deals get turned back on in Indonesia, at the same time our incoming president announces the newest member of his administration, a man who will serve without a formal job title and without a salary and who will not be asked to give up or even disclose any of his business contacts in order to take this new position, a man who has been consulted already on the head of the EPA, who is consulting now on picking the head of the SEC, who will apparently be in charge of reviewing all corporation regulations in the new administration, this new key member of the federal government for whom they have invented a job without a formal portfolio, he is the single largest shareholder in that mining company, whose mines in Indonesia you can see from space.
The company that did not pay the $4 billion shakedown price to that politician who is personally helping Donald Trump get richer in Indonesia as president. And now that company will presumably be in an excellent position to do whatever needs to be done to benefit whoever needs to be benefitted. You scratch my back. I scratch a giant hole in the earth that can be viewed from Mars.
This is apparently what it`s going to be like now. Everybody`s got to pay attention now. I know it feels like time to not pay attention. We`ve all got to pay attention.
A lot more ahead tonight. Stay with us.
MADDOW: Four years ago, in 2012, Democrats won the White House, when President Obama was elected. Democrats also held on to control of the Senate in 2012, which meant that after the 2012 elections, Republicans only held the House. Things got better for the Republicans two years later, in 2014. In 2014, Republicans increased their hold on the House, but they also took control of the Senate.
And so, as you know, for the last two years, for the last two years of the Obama presidency, for this past Congress, even though President Obama has been in the White House, Republicans have been in complete control on Capitol Hill. And they had very high hopes for what they would be able to do with complete control of Congress. We`re looking at archived tape today of the first day of the Congress that ended today, like what happened, today is the final day, what happened on the first day?
There was this great metaphor come to life moment on day one, at the very start of this past Congress. It was then-Republican House Speaker John Boehner. He was formally taking the podium to start this new Congress, to start the session. And we learned something we had never known before.
Watch right over that black banner, see the black banner there? Watch there. Whoop! See that? The podium is a machine. It goes up. Whoop! It rises from the earth.
If you snap your heels together right and say the magic word, it rises, whoop! Anyway. So, that was the first option day of this Congress, we learned that about the podium.
Today is now officially the last day of this Congress, and however excited the Republicans were, however much the metaphors all pointed in an up-going direction, for all the things they were going to do with complete control of the House and the Senate for these past two years, we can now say it has not gone well.
Let`s start just for perspective with after World War II. This is all the congresses, all the sessions of Congress that have happened since 1947. Those blue lines show the number of bills that each Congress was able to pass. The last line with the arrow pointing to it, that is the Congress that comes to an end today. You will notice that Congress over the last few years has been a little stunted, is probably the polite way to put it.
Since the Republicans took over the house in their big wave election in 2010. Look at that, the three Congresses since then, the 112th, 113th, and 114th Congress just ended today, those three are the least productive congresses of all time. Since the Republicans took control of the House in 2010, the three congresses since then rank first, second, and third as the least productive congresses we`ve ever had, since anybody started tracking the productivity of congresses at the end of World War II.
This Congress just ending today also had the lowest confirmation rate for civilian nominees in modern American history. For the first time since the modern budget process was created in 1974, this Congress for the first time ever, they didn`t even try to pass a budget. At least in previous terrible congresses, they tried and failed to pass a budget. This time, they didn`t even bother to try before they failed.
This Congress that just died -- excuse me, this Congress that just ended today, they also worked the fewest days of any Congress in the last 60 years. That`s impressive. Congress is less popular than gum on your shoe. Congress is less popular than gum on your socks. Congress is less popular than gum in your hair. And it has been for a good long time.
But this Congress just wrapping up today, they are special. They have truly distinguished themselves for doing absolutely freaking nothing.
That said, a new Congress starts tomorrow morning. And the new Congress that starts tomorrow is going to be very different than it has been for these past few years. I mean, it`s possible they may be so atrophied from lack of activity that they`re all going to spring something when they raise their hands to get sworn in tomorrow.
But barring that, we`re expecting that things will get very, very busy, very, very fast, start tomorrow, which will be a new thing to behold, after watching Congress doing zippo for six straight years. We have -- the last six years we`ve lived through have been the least productive time in Congress ever. And that`s now what we`ve gotten used to.
Tomorrow, that changes. If you have been zoning out since the election and not wanted to pay attention to the news, I understand it, I get it. Oh, I get it. But stuff really is starting to happen very fast now. The time to not pay attention to the news has come to an end.
And especially we need to focus on something that is about to start tomorrow that we`re not used to seeing. And the story of that is next. Please stay with us.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
REP. PAUL RYAN (R-WI), SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE: (VIDEO GAP) ready for the possible opportunity of having unified government in 2017. The House went through the entire exercise, every committee working every member of the House Republican conference.
HOST: What were you smoking? No one thought that.
RYAN: I know no one thought that but we wanted to be ready. What I told our committees a year ago, our members is, assume we get the White House and Congress, then come 2018, what do you want to have accomplished for the country?
So, this is exactly what Congress and the House has been working on for the last year, getting everything ready to basically rock and roll in 2017 and get working.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
MADDOW: Speaker of the House Paul Ryan is ready to rock and roll, basically, in 2017.
Republicans lost seats in the House and in the Senate in this election. They lost two seats in the Senate. They lost six seats in the House. But they are in charge on both sides of Capitol Hill and are about to have a president of their own party. Donald Trump will be sworn as president January 20th. But the new Congress gets sworn in tomorrow.
And what they say they`re going to start working on out of the gate is a tiny little list -- dismantling Obamacare, starting to rip up Medicaid, which is the health insurance that more than one in five Americans are on. They want to kill the Consumer Financial Production Bureau. They want to kill the Wall Street reforms that were put in place after the crash, the Dodd/Frank law. They want to start privatizing the V.A., which most veterans say they`re very opposed to. And, of course, they want big tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans and for corporations.
And that`s just the start. That`s what they want to start with. It`s a very big and ambitious agenda. They`ve been wait to go fulfill it for years, as you heard Paul Ryan just explain there. They have been planning it for some time now.
Remember those dozens of times they fake repealed Obamacare? Now, we know why they did it so many times. Practice, practice, practice.
But I have to tell you, we`re also just getting in some breaking news tonight from Capitol Hill. This has just come in since we`ve been on the air. It`s apparently started already. House Republicans met in a closed door conference tonight and voted basically to scrap the Independent Ethics Office in Congress.
This is the Office of Congressional Ethics that was created eight years ago after a particularly lurid period of repeated congressional scandals. It`s an independent ethics office that investigates misconduct of lawmakers and staff members in the House. But there was a closed door meeting of House Republicans tonight and they voted that instead of maintaining the independent Office of Congressional Ethics, they`re going to put it under a congressional committee, under the House Ethics Committee.
It sounds like a bureaucratic change, but what that means is there`s no independent ethics oversight of Congress. This means lawmakers themselves now get to police themselves now for ethics. And this means no ethics investigation information will have to be released to the public. They can police themselves now.
Nancy Pelosi put out a statement on this tonight. Quote, ""Republicans claim they want to drain the swamp but the night before the new Congress gets sworn in, the house GOP has eliminated the only independent ethics oversight of their actions. Evidently, ethics are the first casualty of the Republican Congress."" Again, that news breaking in the last half hour.
Joining us now is Ed O`Keefe, congressional reporter for ""The Washington Post"".
Mr. O`Keefe, it`s really nice to see you. Thanks for your time tonight.
ED O`KEEFE, THE WASHINGTON POST: Happy New Year, Rachel. Good to see you.
MADDOW: Happy New Year and happy new Congress.
Let me ask you about this breaking news that we just got about the independent ethics office in Congress. Where did that -- where did that come from and why is this an important change?
O`KEEFE: So, the office of congressional ethics was established back in 2008, essentially in the wake of the Abramoff scandal, the Mark Foley scandal. There was a public outcry and they realized they had to set up an independent watchdog to basically field complaints and concerns about campaign improprieties, personal behavior, other things. It`s existed for the last eight years, barely has a set of teeth, and has presented some information over the past few years that has led to the removal or the resignation of some lawmakers. But there`s a belief that they could have done a lot more.
What Republicans have done -- let`s be specific about this -- have done tonight, is they had a closed door meeting, after the sun went down -- yes, those things actually do happen, and decided amongst themselves that when the new House convenes tomorrow afternoon, they`re going to present a rules package that has to be voted on by Republicans and Democrats that will include closing that office and putting it under the House Ethics Committee. The reason is a majority of Republicans believe that the way this office has worked in the last eight years is in essence unfair to them because it doesn`t allow them a chance to appeal some of these complaints. The new office won`t be allowed to field anonymous tips, which is what the current one has been allowed to do.
One other important thing to point out here: we know that Paul Ryan and Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy opposed closing this office, because they don`t want you and I having this conversation, and they don`t want this to become a PR nightmare for them, frankly, as the new Congress convenes tomorrow. And this goes it seems against everything Donald Trump would have campaigned about, right, draining the swamp and the desire to do things in Washington to make it an ethical place?
Well, this seems to run counter to that. And it will be interesting to watch Republican lawmakers tomorrow explain why they want to do this.
MADDOW: And, Ed, on that point, the substance of this change -- will this be -- will there be a difference now in terms of us, the press, and we, the public, getting information about ethics complaints, about ethics investigations of lawmakers? Is there an issue in terms of just what we have access to when these complaints are made, when lawmakers are looked into in terms of ethical misdoings?
O`KEEFE: Absolutely. And it was already pretty bad to begin with, because the process was so secretive that they couldn`t reveal information, you couldn`t get information out of this office for fear that they would get shut down the way they may tomorrow, frankly. But ultimately, we would get reports that either tell us that somebody was indeed facing some ethical questions or that they had been excused. But it was a months-long, very secretive process. It probably will be even more so now, if it goes through.
MADDOW: And, Ed, in terms of the politics here, you mentioned that very important point that House Speaker Paul Ryan and Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, they didn`t want to do this. They did not want this to be the first headline of the new Congress, that they`ll be getting rid of the ethics office. That implies that they`re having issues controlling their own conference.
I mean, this vote tonight didn`t involve any Democrats. This vote was Republicans only. And they lost it by a lot. If their leadership was telling them to vote no, the yes vote was 119-74.
O`KEEFE: Yes.
MADDOW: That suggests some deep clefts in the Republican caucus, even before they get fully under way.
O`KEEFE: Well, anyone who has been watching this television show known as Congress for the last eight years knows that clefts have existed, frankly. And I think this is just an example of the kinds of divisions we`ll see over the next few months. Yes, Republicans starting tomorrow are going to begin the process of trying to change Obamacare, revamp the tax code, undo the Dodd/Frank financial reforms of the last few weeks, and a host of other things.
But they haven`t come to unanimous agreement on how exactly that should be done. And you`ll see plenty of disagreements over the course of this, between hard core conservatives who want to do it one way, mainstream conservatives who want to do it another, and those that realize that if they do too much of this, they could suffer some setbacks in two years in the 2018 elections.
We`ve seen Democrats successfully run in the past against Republicans by saying they want to undo your Medicaid, your Medicare, now they want to undo your Obamacare, now they want to give it back to the big banks and let them do whatever they want. Those kind of campaign messages can work in some situations.
Yet, they say, and it`s true, they have a mandate because they have total control of Congress and they have the right to at least begin this process. We`ll see how it goes.
MADDOW: Ed O`Keefe, congressional reporter for ""The Washington Post"" -- Ed, I had no idea there would be such substantive news about the new Congress before it even starts. But I`m very glad you`re here talking to us --
O`KEEFE: It shows you what we`re in for. It shows what we`re in for.
MADDOW: Exactly. Time to pay attention. Thanks, Ed. Appreciate it.
O`KEEFE: Take care.
MADDOW: All right. Much more ahead tonight, including some breaking news with some striking visuals about something that`s going on at airports around the country right now.
Plus, an announcement about something that`s going to happen on this show tomorrow which is a very big deal and for which I`m already nervous.
Stay with us.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
TRUMP: I think that computers have complicated lives very greatly. The whole age of computer has made it where nobody knows exactly what`s going on. We have speed. We have a lot of other things. But I`m not sure you have the kind of security you need.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
MADDOW: To borrow a phrase from our president-elect, what I can show you here tonight is the age of computer, when the computer is not working.
This is tonight. The computer system for U.S. Customs and Border Patrol apparently crashed tonight at airports all around the country. The agency says it`s a temporary outage. They say they`re working to fix it.
Customs officials say they`re using alternative procedures for clearing passengers for their flights but meanwhile, thousands of people using U.S. airports tonight, think of all the people coming home from the holiday weekend right now, lots of people need to be back at work tomorrow morning, right? Thousands of people have been stalled at airport counters all around the country tonight.
People have posted pictures of epic lines in Atlanta and Boston and Fort Lauderdale. Two people reportedly fainted tonight while they were trying to wait out a giant line in Miami. More than 30 international flights were affected at Miami.
If you`re wondering whether this computer outage is some sort of cyber attack on U.S. Customs, so far we are not getting any word of that. We don`t yet know what caused the customs computer system to crash. But whatever caused it, this is turning out to be an especially not-nice night at the airport all over the country.
We will let you know as we learn more. But if you are out in the middle of this right now, I`m sorry. Hang in there.
We`ll be right back.
MADDOW: Kennedy was assassinated, of course, in 1963. LBJ stood for election on his own terms the following year, in `64. That`s when he very easily beat Barry Goldwater.
But then, four years later, when it came time to run for reelection, 1968, LBJ decided he didn`t want to run. He bowed out and his vice president became the Democratic nominee that year to succeed him.
And heading into the 1968 election, things didn`t look great for the Democrats. The party was not at all unified behind its candidate, Vice President Hubert Humphrey. And after the civil rights legislation that LBJ had signed, southern white Democrats who are against civil rights, they peeled off to vote for George Wallace, the produced segregationist.
Not to mention the fact that the country was torn up over the Vietnam War, and LBJ was our wartime president. And if you were against the war like most Americans were at the time, you were maybe not excited to vote for LBJ`s vice president to be his Democratic successor that year.
So, things were stacked against the Democrats in `68 anyway. But the Republican candidate running in 1968 knew that very well. Richard Nixon was the Republican candidate in `68. He was determined to take advantage of anti-Vietnam War sentiment in the country.
It seems ironic now, but that`s how he ran in `68, right? He pledged to get rid of the draft. He claimed to have a plan to end the Vietnam War. He argued that if you wanted to end the war, you needed to elect him, you need to vote the Democrats out of office.
One problem arose late in the election, though, when five nights before the election was due to happen, the Democratic president, LBJ, he went on TV, in a nationally televised address and he made a surprise announcement that peace was at hand in Vietnam. The communist side, the North Vietnamese, they were going to make major concessions at peace talks. The U.S. was anticipating that the other side, the South Vietnamese, they were going to agree to a deal based on those concessions. Peace was at hand.
In recognition of the fact that peace was about to be declared, he said the United States would step back right away and stop all military operations in Vietnam. LBJ made that announcement on the Thursday before the election was due to happen on Tuesday. But in the interim, on Saturday morning, it all fell apart because the South Vietnamese side backed out. They decided that they didn`t want the deal. And in fact, they didn`t want to talk about the deal. They pulled out of the peace talks and the war was back on for years.
And one of the reasons we know why those very promising peace talks in 1968 failed is because of this incredible audiotape of LBJ, President Johnson, in 1968, after the whole thing fell apart.
(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)
PRES. LYNDON B. JOHNSON: Hello?
OPERATIOR: Go ahead, please, sir.
SEN. RICHARD RUSSELL: Good morning, Mr. President.
JOHNSON: How are you, my friend?
RUSSELL: Just fine.
JOHNSON: Well, we`ve got one this morning that`s pretty rough for you.
We have found that our, our friend, the Republican nominee, our California friend, has been playing on the outskirts with our enemies and our friends both, he has been doing it through rather subterranean sources here. And he has been saying to the allies that you`re going to get sold out.
(END AUDIO CLIP)
MADDOW: Johnson confiding in his longtime friend, Senator Richard Russell, that the Republican nominee, Richard Nixon, had been interfering in the peace talks to blow them up. Richard Nixon approached the South Vietnamese side in the peace talks and told them, get out of these peace talks, don`t agree to a deal, you`re getting suckered here. Just wait until after the election when he, Richard Nixon, would be president and he`d give them a much better deal.
Nixon`s intermediary was caught on tape actually telling South Vietnamese, just hang on through the election, hang on. Basically, don`t end the war, we need the war to keep going until the election. Hold on until you get Nixon.
And those communications to the South Vietnamese worked. I mean, at least the politics worked for Nixon. Nixon got elected. But he always denied he`d done anything to prolong the war for his own political purposes. He always denied he`d done anything to destroy that chance at peace in Vietnam, always denied that to the end.
Now, we know his denials were total bullpucky. Author of a new Nixon biography, historian John Farrell, has uncovered notes from Nixon`s closest aide showing that Nixon directed his campaign to scuttle the peace talks. October 22nd, 1968, notes taken by that staffer. H.R. Haldeman, show that Nixon told him to monkey wrench these efforts to start the peace negotiations.
Quote, ""Any other way to monkey wrench it? Anything R.N., anything Richard Nixon can do?""
Nixon also directed his vice presidential candidate Spiro Agnew to threaten the CIA Director Richard Helms around these negotiations. The notes read ""Agnew, go see Helms, tell him we want the truth or he hasn`t got the job."" Meaning he won`t stay on as director of the CIA once I`m president unless he does what I want here.
Nothing like threatening the CIA director even before you take office, right? I mean, that`s one way to get kind of paranoid that maybe your intelligence agencies might turn on you or they`re after you, that they`re a political actor that needs to be managed. That`s exactly what happened.
In the months before President-elect Nixon took office, he was so skeptical of intelligence agencies in the United States government that he refused to accept the intelligence briefings offered by the outgoing administration. He didn`t take a single face-to-face meeting with the CIA staff that was in place specifically to provide transition support to him.
Intelligence community sent Nixon`s transition, they sent them envelopes containing the presidential daily briefs since he wouldn`t do a face-to- face briefing. At the end of his transition period, his office returned all the envelopes unopened. He was convinced that the intelligence communities were all politically biased. They were political player. They`ve been working behind the scene to get his opponent elected.
For nearly 50 years, Richard Nixon was the only president-elect to openly distrust the intelligence community to that kind of degree -- before now.

REPORTER: It seems like you have a tendency, just looking at it from the outside, to doubt American intelligence when it comes to Russian hacking. I`m trying to just better understand why it seems that way.
TRUMP: Well, I just want them to be sure because it`s a pretty serious charge. And I want them to be sure. And if you look at the weapons of mass destruction, that was a disaster and they were wrong. So, I want them to be sure.
I think it`s unfair if they don`t know. And I know a lot of hacking and hacking is a very hard thing to prove. So, it could be somebody else. And I also know things that other people don`t know and so, they cannot be sure of this situation.
REPORTER: Like what? What do you know that other people don`t know?
TRUMP: You`ll find out on Tuesday or Wednesday.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
MADDOW: ""I know a lot about hacking. I know things that other people don`t know. They cannot be sure of the situation.""
So far, we don`t know what Mr. Trump knows that the rest of us do not know. Maybe we will find out tomorrow or Wednesday. Although his campaign says, don`t hold your breath.
We have seen this kind of strange relationship with the intelligence community before. It was earned in very different ways then. It was weird then. It`s weird now. But at least there is some precedent. Not a good precedent. There is some precedent.
MADDOW: A few years ago, the great Steve Benin who writes the blog for our show, he picked up a few years ago on something going mostly unnoticed in beltway politics when it comes to the Sunday morning political shows Republican, guests consistently outnumber the Democrats. We`re talking about the five major political shows that air every Sunday morning.
Starting in 2013, Steve started compiling a list of every guess on every Sunday show, and lo and behold, turns out Republicans took up 10 of the top 13 spots.
Leading the way was former House Intelligence Committee chairman, Republican Congressman Mike Rogers. He made 27 appearances that first year. He did the same list again in 2014. Once again, Mike Rogers came out on top. In 2014, not a single Democrat featured in the top ten.
2015, Mike Rogers retired. Replacing him at the top of the Sunday show rankings was Donald Trump.
But the pattern of Republican dominance continued. 2015, out of the top 20 guests on the Sunday shows, four of the 20 were Democrats. Four.
And that brings us to 2016. Steve has again gone through the process of crunching the numbers so the rest of us can just relax and yell at the TV. But again, it turns out Republicans were overrepresented on the shows. They took up 12 of the top 16 spots in 2016.
But this time, we got a new leader and it was not a Republican. First time it`s happened. Except, of course, it wasn`t a Democrat, either.
Number one spot, first time ever, Bernie Sanders. Independent senator from Vermont. 2016, Bernie Sanders blew the competition out of the water. He appeared on the Sunday shows 70 times almost doubling the president-elect who came in second place.
Senator Sanders was supposed to be here with us live on this show tonight. Due to weather-related issues, he could not get here in time. I`m sorry about that.
But I think tomorrow night, I think we are going to be joined by two of the biggest power brokers, power sources, power senators in the Democratic Party. One of whom is well known but nobody knows exactly what kind of a leader he`s going to be -- Chuck Schumer. And one of whom is very well known but nobody exactly knows how he`s going to fit into the new Democratic Party -- Bernie Sanders.
The new Democratic leader in the Senate, Chuck Schumer, will be with us tomorrow night. I plan to ask him about what the Democratic Party is going to do in the age of Trump.
We will also, I think, have the aforementioned Bernie Sanders who has kindly agreed to come back even though old man winter kept him away tonight. He`s juggling our schedule so he can try to join us tomorrow to talk with me about my many questions about what he`s going to do now.
So, big night tomorrow night. Chuck Schumer and we think Bernie Sanders. We`ll see you then.
That does it for us tonight. See you again tomorrow.
Now, it`s time for ""THE LAST WORD WITH LAWRENCE O`DONNELL"".

(END VIDEOTAPE)
MELBER: Good evening from New York. I`m Ari Melber in for Chris Hayes. There are 18 days until Donald Trump becomes President. And it`s clear he will enter office with a diplomatic crisis on his hands. Washington ringing in the new year with fewer Russian diplomats around -- payback for Russia`s interference in the 2016 election. While President Obama cast the sanctions as a direct response to Russian hacking of the emails, there are brand-new revelations of other Russian hacks that went beyond that now infamous email effort. And into something more physical. New reports of hacks that could impact America`s electricity grid. The Washington Post reporting a U.S. utility company, Burlington Electric, found Russian affiliated hacking codes penetrating their computer hardware.
Thankfully, their computer was not connected to the utility grid systems. A foreign intrusion that could impact America`s electricity and affect public safety would be obviously significant for any president. Add in the plots to impact America`s democratic system and you would expect a new president to strike a posture of strength, if not outright, indignation against this adversary, which is what makes Donald Trump`s responses so bizarre thus far. He continues to question whether U.S. intelligence is correct about Russia`s guilt, and then he`s publicly undercutting the current president`s sanctions by welcoming Russia`s response to them. Trump wrote, quote, ""Great move on delay by V. Putin. I always knew he was very smart."" That was after Putin said that any diplomatic response to the sanctions would wait until Trump takes office. And this weekend, Trump reiterated that the U.S. Intel could be wrong adding that he knows a lot about hacking and is privy to some special information here.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
TRUMP: It`s a pretty serious charge and I want them to be sure. And if you look at the weapons of mass destruction, that was a disaster. And they were wrong. And so, I want them to be sure. I think it`s unfair if they don`t know, and I know a lot about hacking, and hacking is a very hard thing to prove, so it could be somebody else. And I also know things that other people don`t know, and so they cannot be sure of the situation.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: What do you know that other people don`t know?
TRUMP: You`ll find out on Tuesday or Wednesday
(END VIDEO CLIP)
MELBER: That`s tomorrow or the next day. Trump`s spokesperson Sean Spicer, though, later clarifying Trump won`t be revealing -- he won`t be revealing anything privileged tomorrow or Wednesday. And then, Spicer was deflecting on Russia`s role by arguing that maybe election interference is more of an issue for Hillary Clinton than Vladimir Putin.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
SPICER: Why aren`t we talking about the influence -- other influences on the election? Why aren`t we talking about Hillary Clinton get debate questions ahead of time? That`s a pretty valid attempt to influence an election.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
MELBER: Spicer is citing an email there that showed a democratic operative on CNN appeared to share debate questions in advance with Clinton, an email that was revealed by the underlying Russian hack. Now, Trump`s aides would apparently prefer to take shots at Hillary Clinton than address the foreign policy dilemmas they`re facing right now. It`s easy to see why. It`s pretty easy to blame your competitor for everything. That is, of course, what 2016 was all about. But 2016 is over. This is 2017. It`s not a test. And it`s about to get much more difficult for Donald Trump.
Joining me now former CIA Operations Officer and a 2016 Independent Presidential Candidate, Evan McMullin. What do you think of what we`re seeing here and this apparently bizarre inability to deal with what might be negative information about Russia separate from what you do about it by the Trump administration incoming?
EVAN MCMULLIN, FORMER PRESIDENTIAL INDEPENDENT CANDIDATE: Well, I think we have to ask ourselves, the entire country, why is Donald Trump and his team working so hard to protect Russia in the situation? It`s clear that Russia worked to undermine our democracy, to influence our election. The Intel com-the Intel community came out unanimously in October and said this is what Russia is doing. But you don`t need to be an intelligence officer to know that. Russia is doing the same thing here in our country that it`s done in Europe and it is still doing in Europe and Germany, for example.
That is funding groups like white supremacist groups, white nationalist groups, using internet trolls from -- that they employ in Russia, supporting their cable network here in America. It`s RT America. Doing all of these things to support Donald Trump and to undermine American`s faith in democracy. You don`t need to be an intelligence officer to know this. And then on top of all of that, you have the hacks. So this is a playbook they`ve deployed before. We`re seeing it here in America. We`ve got to climb the learning curve as Americans on this real quick because as we see these, these efforts are not stopping. Russia continues to undermine our democracy.
MELBER: And so, when you look at Donald Trump trying to thread the needle or basically do the typical campaign talk right, between blaming Hillary or saying oh you know I got special info, I`ve got a couple more days, you know, the clock is running out on your ability to do this when you`re actually going to be President.
MCMULLIN: Absolutely, it is. And we need better leadership, frankly. We need to see better leadership from Donald Trump. I don`t think we`re going to see it, but I`m forever hopeful that somehow we`ll see a change. But this claim that he has information, that he, quote, knows things that others don`t know, I find that highly, I`m highly skeptical that that`s true. In fact I think it`s absolutely not true. But let`s take a look at what he is doing and why.
MELBER: You have a really nice way of saying that he`s full of B.S.
MCMULLIN: You`re right.
MELBER: Yeah, well, but, and you`re saying it as respectfully as you can. What do you think your former colleagues here in the intelligence agencies are thinking though when Donald Trump seems to use every time this issue arises to sort of get into their biggest embarrassment on Iraq and sort of cast doubt about the entire integrity or the competence of the entire operation.
MCMULLIN: Well, he - of course, they`re unhappy about that, but I think that speaks to a much deeper source of tension between the intelligence community and Donald Trump. That is that Donald Trump wants to align our country, his administration, with the very country that is attacking our democracy, the intelligence community and the national security community in general warned against him, warned against this policy approach during the election, and that`s not going to change. There`s a very deep source of tension there. But Donald Trump continues to attack the media. He attacks the intelligence community. He attacks any other source of information because that`s what authoritarians do. And as I`ve said for the last several months, Donald Trump is somebody who has authoritarian tendencies.
MELBER: Well, you said-- I just want to pause in the point you`re making. You think this is bigger than the Russia debate which is one piece of it. You think that unlike basically most other incoming Presidents, he doesn`t want to give any informational deference to the intelligence community because their ability to call it as they see it is a threat in his mind to his own power?
MCMULLIN: Absolutely it is. This is, this is, how authoritarians operate this is why they attack the media, this is why they attack other sources of power. This is why they try to undermine democratic norms and democratic systems. This is part of the playbook. So this is what happens. Donald Trump gets painted into a corner because the media, because the intelligence community and so many others can see that Russia is attacking our democracy. And he refuses to acknowledge it. And so he denies it, says we should move on. And ultimately he says because there`s no other way, I`ve got information that you don`t have. But I`m not going to tell you for a few days.
So what happens? Then we in the media talk about it for a few days, repeating his claim to know things that no one else does, half of America believes it. Half of us don`t. But to his audience, you know, they believe it. And we`ve carried that message in the media. So he has won, and he`s playing us by doing this.
MELBER: Right.
MCMULLIN: Now, what we have to do is call him out when he does reveal whatever he knows that other people don`t know allegedly, we`ve got to ask, OK where did that information come from?
MELBER: Well, and you said half of America, I think we have to fact check that, I believe it`s about 46 percent.
MCMULLIN: Sure. Right.
MELBER: Evan Mcmullin, thank you very much for joining. I would say Happy New Year, but you didn`t leave me feeling that happy. Up next, Michael McFaul former U.S. Ambassador to Russia. First, Mr. Ambassador, your response to what I was just discussing with Evan and your view of where intelligence and diplomacy meet here.
MICHAEL MCFAUL, FORMER US AMBASSADOR TO RUSSIA: Well, intelligence is a major part of diplomacy, it`s a major part of our developing a foreign policy. In a few weeks President Trump is going to be working with these very people that he`s saying very distrustful things about. And I want to remind your viewers that the vast, vast majority of the people that work in the intelligence community are not political appointees.
MELBER: Right.
MCFAUL: They`re professionals that will be there on January 20th working for President Trump. and diplomacy meet here.
MELBER: Mr. Ambassador, when we look at the sanctions that are currently being deployed against Russia, when Trump comes in, do they just continue automatically? What does it take for him to change them?
MCFAUL: Yes, they do continue. And so, it will be incumbent upon him to be proactive to change them. If he chooses to do so. And in doing so, I think he`ll have to explain to the American people and to his own administration, I want to keep emphasizing that, these people are going to be working for him come January 20th, why he is reversing it. And you know, maybe there, there will be an argument. I look forward to the, the new intelligence that he allegedly has. Maybe there`s some reason for it but right now, I think that would be a very difficult thing for him to do without explaining his actions.
MELBER: You mentioned the intelligence he claims to have. What would he have? Either he has something that is from the intelligence community and we spend about $17 billion a year trying to get the best possible, or he has it from some other nonpublic source, would that be a Russian source, or what other source would there be for special Intel that is not within the cache of what they already have within our 17 agencies?
MCFAUL: You know, to be honest, I have no idea. I hear that. It disappoints me. I wish he would spend a little more time learning about our intelligence and learning, you know, do a deep dive in -- counter espionage and maybe understand these things better. Maybe he has some source from somebody who provided Wikileaks with the data. That`s a conspiracy floating out there on twitter and facebook, but i guess we`ll just have to wait until Tuesday to find out.
MELBER: What do you think about his wider habit here of saying ""we don`t know"", ""we don`t know, things we as a government or we as a country do know? I mean, why is that so important to him rhetorically or politically and does it remind you of anything you`ve seen abroad in the way some leaders sometimes seem to prefer the conspiracy theories of the street to what`s actually knowable?
MCFAUL: Well, he`s denying it because he`s worried that it affects the legitimacy of his election. And of course if--more people believed that the Russians influenced our election, that would delegitimate his electoral victory. But I think that`s the wrong strategy for him. He`s been elected. The Electoral College has spoken. Everybody is preparing for him to be sworn in. I think it actually would help him to put this behind us if he acknowledged the facts. I mean, I personally think we need a bipartisan independent commission so that we get all the facts and all the facts, by the way, of how the Obama administration handled this intelligence challenge during the election. And so that it could be wrapped up. Everybody knows the facts. And then we get on with doing the things we need to do to prepare for the next election cycle. Because the Russians have tremendous capability. It`s going to be will be better in 2020. Other actors are going to have capabilities in 2020. We need to defend ourselves, not pretending that we weren`t attacked.
MELBER: Right. The other big nuclear story here is North Korea as a-as a aspirational power. Here is what Donald Trump wrote on Twitter. North Korea just stated it`s in the final stages of developing a nuclear weapon capable of reaching parts of the U.S. ""It won`t happen!"" How does that sort of declarative statement compare to the actual bipartisan process over two administrations to have some kind of constraint of their ambition?
MCFAUL: I work here at Stanford with George Shultz, the former Secretary Of State for Ronald Reagan, and he always talks about never make a threat unless you`re ready to deliver on it. And what troubles me about that tweet is he`s now made a declaratory statement about policy. And I, I just don`t know if he`s done the homework to actually know if he could implement the threat that he`s just put out.
MELBER: Wow. Well put and thank you for your time, Ambassador Michael McFaul. As always, appreciate it.
MCFAUL: Thanks for having me.
MELBER: Still ahead, Donald Trump continuing to conduct business as usual. His private resort was selling hundreds of thousands of dollars in tickets this weekend. That was for the New Year`s Eve party with the President- elect. We`ll explain what`s wrong with that after the break.
MELBER: He was repeatedly accused of conflicts of interest over his former employer, Halliburton Oil, which got lucrative contracts in Iraq. Imagine though if Cheney had not stepped down from his job as Halliburton CEO before taking office. It would have been technically legal. Presidents and Vice presidents are not formally required to commit any day job. It would have caused all kinds of problems but technically Dick Cheney could have served at the White House and remained CEO of an oil company. He didn`t. And that has many people literally longing for Dick Cheney`s approach to conflicts of interest right about now. Because so far, Donald Trump refuses to divest at all from the Trump organization and he`s not even stepping back from business activities that would literally be really easy to skip.
Take a look at this weekend, for example, when Trump headlined the New Year`s Eve party at his Mar-a-Lago Resort. And this is not just his private vacation home, which he would have every understandable right to go visit, this is a business. It charges $100,000 for annual membership fees -- excuse me, a one-time membership and another $14,000 in annual dues -- hard to keep track of because it`s so expensive. And Trump says the whole thing is worth over $50 million. Some of the value coming from selling the tickets to the big events, like New Year`s Eve festivities. Tickets for the Mar-a-Lago party, take a look, started at $500 a pop, according to POLITICO.
Trump`s government spokesperson told reporters beforehand that the event was sold out, 800 attendees. And while the private club does not reveal its financials, those tickets alone would land somewhere north of $400,000 in revenue for Mar-a-Lago. Now, let`s pause on that figure because there is something very abnormal here that many people want to normalize. That $400,000 which Trump banked in one night is the amount the president earns in a year. It`s not chump change. It`s real money. And as Trump tweets and tries to distract his way through this transition, it`s the money he`s making in this basic situation, mixing his roles as President-elect and as head of a private company, at the very -- at the very least, he risks the appearance of mixing government work meant to be in the public interest with his family business.
Now according to reports, attendees at the New Year`s Eve party included music producer Quincy Jones, actor Sylvester Stallone, and Fabio, who needs no introduction. And did any foreign government officials buy their way into the party or any lobbyists? We just don`t know because this was a private event on private property. The most secretive kind of event the president can even attend. If the money were going to the RNC, for example, instead of the Trump organization, every attendee`s name would be public under federal law. If this were even a White House reception, every attendees name would be public under federal law. Now, we do know Trump`s business partner from Dubai attended the party. Cell phone video showed Trump giving him a shout out during his speech and a spokesman for the transition says quote, ""They had no formal meetings or professional discussions. Their interactions were social.""
That may be true. There may have been only one business partner in attendance, or may not be true. We will never know and as long as Donald Trump keeps spending his time generating revenue for his companies, he will continue raising questions and conflicts that could cast a cloud over his presidency and, more importantly, over the independence of his administration.
For more, I`m joined by Ken Vogel, Chief Investigative Reporter for Politico who has been on the story. Ken, the money here, why does it matter if the President-elect is at this event generating this revenue?
KENNETH VOGEL, CHIEF INVESTIGATIVE REPORTER FOR POLITICO: Well, it certainly creates the appearance, Ari, that what he is doing is essentially selling access to himself. Sure, this club Mar-a-Lago has had these types of events before at a major holidays, on New Year`s, on Christmas, on Thanksgiving. But what it hasn`t had is a featured guest who, by the way, happens to be the President-elect of the United States of America. So, the way that they explain this is just business as usual. This is the way Mar- a-Lago conducts business. That seems sort of a (INAUDIBLE) explanation given the circumstances. And forget about the money that Trump receives from this and would have received whether he was President-elect or not.
The specter that he is essentially allowing anyone who has the money to either buy a membership or the access to someone who has a membership who can pay for a ticket to something like this, creates appearance of forget about the possible business partners who were in there or the celebrities, it`s the people who want to get access to Trump. I mean, $525 to get access to the President-elect of the United States is an amazing deal for any potential foreign business person or a person who wants to do business with the United States Government, special interests, lobbyists. You could just imagine going down the line the types of people over whom this would be an amazing deal.
(CROSSTALK)
MELBER: Well, look at the -- Ken, look at the contrast here. He ran a campaign saying because he has money and a business he won`t be beholden to these interests. That was a big selling point for him. And a lot of people believed it, naively or not, saying, ""Well, he does have money so he will fundraise less."" And there`s a truth to that. But that truth seems to be dwarfed by what was on display this weekend which is the business actually makes him more beholden than campaign money and, as we`ve been saying, is less traceable, less transparent.
VOGEL: And it`s also much trickier for him to extricate himself or for there to be transparency around. So, let`s say, given the benefit of the doubt and saying he goes to the extreme end of divestiture, of trying to distance himself from his businesses. Well, he`s still going to vacation at Mar-a-Lago, even if he has Mar-a-Lago in a blind trust or he doesn`t really know whether his businesses -- his portfolio includes Mar-a-Lago, he still knows someone is paying money to this entity that is so closely associated with him that may or may not be in his portfolio, that may or may not be in the blind trust that his kids may or may not oversee, and here they are sitting on the couch or the patio for dinner with the President-elect of the United States. It`s just a very complicated situation. That cannot be easily extricate, can`t easily extricate himself from it.
MELBER: So, let`s stipulate that that`s what people who care about good governance, ethics performers, a lot of journalists and people who think about these kind of issues, that`s what they`re concerned about. Let`s put that to the side then and then look at the actual Trump team`s response. What are we learning about where they`re at? Because this is a guy who said he was going to hold a big announcement to clean this up. Things were going to change. The kids are going to be in charge. Said all this stuff, and then when you looked at his actions, not the tweets, not the announcements, or the announcements he never gave, the action is them doing this and then saying, ""Hey, what`s the matter? This is just business as usual."" Does that tell you there`s something wrong if they think ""business as usual"" is okay when he`s the President-elect?
VOGEL: I mean, it`s a little bit of a sign of where their head is at as they try to grapple with this incredibly complicated situation where they try to put to rest these concerns about conflicts of interest and try to find a sustainable system going forward for separating himself from his businesses. In a way, it`s just I cannot -- for the life of me figure out how it can be done in a way that will satisfy sort of the good government concerns that I think are validly being raised in this another situations.
MELBER: Well, and complexity has become a little bit of a dodge for them. There are parts that are complex, in other words, you can`t just legally force someone into having a fire sale, right, and potentially costing them a lot of money. That`s not typically how a disillusion would work. That is -- that is actually complex. What`s not complex is making the decision to not sell yourself for $500 access and tickets. That`s not complex. That`s simple. If you wanted to skip the party, you could skip the party. If you wanted to donate the funds that New Year`s to charity, you could donate the funds. There`s a million simple ways to do that, they chose none of those and then they counterattacked and told people, ""Hey, don`t be mad. It`s business as usual."" That`s my final thought. Ken Vogel, I appreciate you giving us yours.
VOGEL: Yeah, I mean it`s not just the excuse that this is the way it`s always been done. They went further in our story where we reveal that the tickets are being sold for $525 for members-(INAUDIBLE)
MELBER: All right, Ken, thank you very much for your time and happy to hear your last thought while we look at the eagle. No better image. Coming up, we showed you the clip, and maybe you noticed the guy holding the eagle statue. If you`re wondering what it is about, we actually have the answer right after a quick break.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
TRUMP: Regulations are going off, we`re going to get rid of Obamacare.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
MELBER: That footage of President-elect Donald Trump`s New Year`s Eve party at his Mar-a-Lago resort, might have you wondering who`s the enthusiastic gentleman over there to Mr. Trump`s right and what is the deal with that eagle statue being held by another gentleman to Trump`s left. And don`t they have something they could put this thing on so that poor guy doesn`t have to just cradle it the whole time? And gosh, when you`re seeing someone give a stump speech, you don`t even know how long it`s going to go, you`re just holding it. Well, the answer, courtesy of a Facebook post from the American Academy of Hospitality Sciences, is the man at the right is Joseph D. Cinque, President of the American Academy of Hospitality Sciences, and the eagle is bronze, a bronze eagle awarded by the Academy and there is more.
Trump has actually been honored before by this same academy and its president. Last May, Trump was the presumptive republican nominee and the hospitality academy gave an award to Trump`s Scottish golf course, you see there, as the best golf course worldwide. Which prompted this Yahoo! News headline, quote, ""How a convicted felon nicknamed `Joey No Socks` covered Donald Trump in stars."" That article explained that over the past decade, Trump has received many similar awards from that same man including five and six-star ratings for Trump properties and the Chicago Tribune reported on it thusly quote, ""The organization is run by Joseph Cinque, a long time Trump acquaintance who goes by the nickname `Joey No Socks` and has a felony conviction for possessing stolen property.
And perhaps most importantly, this eagle was far more cooperative than this eagle, you may remember from that Time Magazine shoot in 2015. It`s a live eagle. What do you expect? Look at it - look at him go. America. Up next, David Cay Johnston is here on the President-elect and his evolving relationship with corporate welfare.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Look, everything that he does right now he gets -- he speaks with the head of Sprint, gets 5,000 jobs moved from abroad. And everyone starts to mock, well all those jobs were already announced. They weren`t. The sales jobs had been previously announced, these jobs are coming from abroad to America. And instead of trying to mock him or undermine him, it`s time that people started giving him credit for actually getting things done.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
MELBER: Getting things done. President-elect Donald Trump`s incoming press secretary Sean Spicer there insisting those 5,000 jobs Donald Trump said Sprint was bringing back to the U.S. are new. They are not. They are part of a holistic deal previously announced by Sprint`s parent company SoftBank.
But American corporations are now facing pressure to go along with Donald Trump`s jobs claims.
The New York Times slamming it in a new editorial that has called, quote, why corporations are helping Donald Trump lie about jobs.
The piece explains why it`s so messy for the government, through President- elect Trump to try to leverage companies in this manner, quote, ""it`s easy to see why SoftBank and Sprint might want to help Mr. Trump take credit for creating jobs, SoftBank`s chief executive wants the Department of Justice`s antitrust division and the Federal Communications Commission to allow a merger between Sprint and T-Mobile, quote, Mr. San sees a new opening for his deal in Mr. Trump who has surrounded himself with people who have sided with large telecommunications companies and regulatory debates and have argued against tough antitrust enforcement.
The Times explains why this should be objectionable to conservatives and liberals alike, since it is, quote, crony capitalism with potentially devastating consequences.
Joining me now, Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative journalist David Cay Johnston, a columnist with The Daily Beast and the author of the making of Donald Trump.
I`d like to start by just walking through how this works. It appears that Donald Trump will have some private communication with a company and then he will take the lead in the announcement, separate from what would normally happen in corporate communications, right, whether that`s to the public or to shareholders would be some formal business announcement.
You have a lot of expertise here. So, explain how it works.
DAVID CAY JOHNSTON, THE DAILY BEAST: Well, this is a con job plain and simple, Ari, this is a con job. And the numbers we`re talking about are absolutely inconsequential.
In the case of Sprint, it`s Japanese honor, the reportedly the wealthiest man in Japan, has had a plan in place for some time, and he also is going to want something from Donald Trump. Remember he tried to merge Sprint with T-Mobile and the Justice Department said no for antitrust reasons. You can agree or disagree with that, but he cleraly wants to do that and other actions in the future. And so what he`s doing is buttering up Donald Trump. And this is another variation of what we`re seeing with various people manipulating Trump as we`ve seen with Vladimir Putin.
On the other side, if you`re the CEO of a big company, of course, you`re going to do everything you can to let Donald Trump take credit because you don`t want him to use any of his enormous powers to make trouble for your shareholders. In fact, you essentially now have a fiduciary duty to kiss the president`s ring.
MELBER: When you say fiduciary duty, you are referring to the legal obligation these corporate executives have to actually maximize profits...
JOHNSTON: To their shareholders.
MELBER: ...to their shareholders, right. Their legal duty actually is to the company, but as a practical matter, yes, it`s to the shareholders. And they`re not going to do anything, no matter what Trump does, to put in jeopardy their position, the company`s position, and so Donald Trump is now in a position to basically extract from these people things that may or may not be good judgment.
You know, Ari, I`m old enough to remember when Republicans actually thought business should make its own decisions without government interference.
MELBER: Wait a minute.
JOHNSTON: That was only six months ago.
MELBER: You used the word extraction. I mean, at a certain point the outlines of what you`re describing sound like a shakedown, but instead of getting something very valuable for the country, the main shakedown is to get something that is rhetorically, or PR valuable for Donald Trump.
JOHNSTON: Absolutely. And let`s not lose sight of the fact that these are in Donald -- in Trumpian terms small potatoes. We`re about to get the government`s announcement for December on jobs. It`s probably going to show 82 consecutive months of jobs growth, the old record was 52. We`re close to 16 million private sector jobs under this administration. Very few Americans know that, but everybody has heard about the 730 jobs that Trump inflated to 1,1000 in Ohio, and very few people know that was a deal that violated Trump`s own position in the campaign when he said corporate welfare, interest-free loans and other tax favors didn`t create jobs, now he`s the champion of them.
Donald is an absolute corporate chameleon on these issues and whatever makes Trump look good no matter what it costs companies -- companies better line up and pay attention.
MELBER: All right, corporate chameleon. Say that ten times fast.
David Cay Johnston, thank you for joining me tonight.
JOHNSTON: Thank you, Ari.
MELBER: Still ahead, the Democrats plan to stall some of Donald Trump`s most controversial nominations. Who are they targeting? That`s coming up.
And tonight`s Thing One and Thing Two starts right after this break.
MELBER: Thing One tonight, 36 years ago in Tempe, Arizona, Bruce Springsteen made what are believed to be his first publicly recorded comments about politics.
Now it was November 5, 1980, in other words, one day after Ronald Reagan was elected president.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN, SINGER: I don`t know what you guys think about happened last night, but I think it`s pretty frightening. There will be a lot of people depending on you coming up. So, here we go.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
MELBER: Now decades later, Springsteen would become an advocate for President Obama campaigning both in 2008 and 2012, and he campaigned for Hillary Clinton this year.
But if he was frightened by Reagan`s election all the way back in 1980, how is the boss feeling about Donald Trump`s victory? Those brand new comments, they are Thing Two in 60 seconds.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
SPRINGSTEEN: Let`s all do our part so we can look back on 2016 and say we stood with Hillary Clinton on the right side of history, that`s why I`m standing here with you tonight for the dream of a better America.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
MELBER: That was Bruce Springsteen campaigning for Hillary Clinton on the eve of the election. In a new interview for the WTF podcast with comedian Mark Marin out today Springsteen spoke candidly about why Trump and this new era scares him.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
MARK MARIN, COMEDIAN: Are you scared now?
SPRINGSTEEN: Yeah. Yeah. Of course. How could you not be.
MARIN: Right. Have you felt this fear before?
SPRINGSTEEN: No.
MARIN: right.
SPRINGSTEEN: I`ve felt disgust before.
MARIN: Right.
SPRINGSTEEN: But never the kind of fear that you feel now.
MARIN: right.
SPRINGSTEEN: It`s as simple as the fear of -- is someone simply competent enough to do this particular job?
MARIN: Right.
SPRINGSTEEN: Forget about where they are ideologically.
MARIN: Right.
SPRINGSTEEN: Do they have the pure competence to be put in a position of such responsibility.
MARIN: And what`s your biggest fear of it as we enter it?
SPRINGSTEEN: I suppose would be that a lot of the worst things and the worst aspects of what he appealed to comes to fruition. When you let that genie out of the bottle -- bigotry, racism -- when you let those things out of the bottle...
MARIN: Intolerance.
SPRINGSTEEN: ...intolerance. They don`t go back in the bottle that easily, if they go back in at all.
MARIN: Right.
SPRINGSTEEN: You know, whether it`s a rise in hate crimes, people feeling they have license to speak and behave in ways that previously were considered un-American and are un-American. That`s what he`s appealing to.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
MELBER: It`s no secret Donald Trump didn`t get along that well with House Speaker Paul Ryan or Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell back during the election. But a new report from The New York Post has some fresh ideas into just how deep that divide could remain.
The Post reporting that President-elect Trump told Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer he actually likes him, a Democrat, more than McConnell and Ryan because the two Republican leaders, quote, wanted him to lose.
Now, The Post cites a source close to the Trump transition team for that quote. And I spoke today to a congressional Democratic source who said Democrats don`t dispute the quote.
Now, Schumer and Trump are both born and raised New Yorkers. Trump`s even donated to Schumer`s senate campaign in the past. But that`s about as far as it goes. In fact, The Washington Post report says that Senate Democrats, led by Schumer, are planning to contest at least eight of Trump`s nominees and want to stretch their confirmation hearings all the way into March.
Those eight targeted nominees include Exxon CEO Rex Tillerson for Secretary of State as well as Senator Jeff Sessions, Trump`s controversial pick for attorney general.
Those two battles in early skirmishes already well under way. Democrats in the Senate foreign relations committee reportedly saying they`re outraged Tillerson will not release his full tax returns from the last three years as many cabinet nominees do, although not always the Secretary of State nominee.
Now Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee, as well as progressive groups, are accusing Senator Sessions of omitting basically decades worth of his records about his career from the information that he did provide pursuant to the confirmation hearings. Now, given the fact that Republicans control the senate, how much can Senate Democrats really do to stifle the nominations to the Trump cabinet and what does the opposition look like in both houses of congress once Trump takes office? Well, I will ask some very special guests about that right after the break.
MELBER: Welcome back.
Earlier in the broadcast we stated that music producer Quincy Jones attended Trump`s New Year`s Eve party at Mar-a-Lago. While Donald Trump`s spokesman, Sean Spicer, said Quincy Jones would attend, we want to correct the record, Jones spokesperson explains he did not plan to attend and spent New Year`s in Los Angeles.
Now, meanwhile, back in Capitol Hill, a fight brewing over a Trump nominee who has been in this position before.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
SEN. EDWARD KENNEDY, (D) MASSACHUSETTS: Mr. Sessions is a throwback to a shameful era, which I know both black and white Americans thought was in our past. It`s inconceivable to me that a person of this attitude is qualified to be a U.S. attorney let alone a United States federal judge.
He is, I believe, a disgrace to the Justice Department and he should withdraw his nomination and resign his position.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
MELBER: That was the late Senator Ted Kennedy speaking during the 1986 confirmation hearing for Jeff Sessions, then a nominee for a federal judgeship. Now, Sessions was ultimately denied that position by the Senate Judiciary Committee. It was a 10-8 vote. And Senate Democrats are now looking to block up to eight of Trump`s cabinet nominees. Senator Sessions widely considered one of the most controversial.
Joining me tonight to discuss what this whole opposition fight will look like in 2017 is Sarah Isgur Flores, a spokesperson for Jeff Session confirmation, Howard Cean, former chair of the DNC and MSNBC political analyst, and Christina Greer, associate professor of political science at Fordham.
Welcome, everyone.
Christina, I`ll start with you. The Sessions nomination is controversial. It also as a matter of the historical record is somewhat unusual because he is the only nominee who has been previously basically passed on by the Senate for a different position.
Your thoughts on him this time?
CHRISTINA GREER, FORDHAM UNIVERSITY: Well, keep in mind, his own colleagues and his own members of his party deemed him to be too racist in Reagan`s 1980s. And so when you have someone like the late Senator Ted Kennedy essentially saying that he`s not only an embarrassment to the profession and he should not be elevated to attorney general or to even a judge, the writings of Senator Sessions are so deplorable, it`s not just about black Americans in this country, it`s about how he feels about the history, but also the future of this country.
So the fact that Donald Trump, in the 21st Century, in 2016, chose this particular individual to me and to many others, black and white and other, sends a very distinct message about the dog bark, not even a dog whistle, the dog bark that he`s trying to send about his racialized platforms.
And so Senator Sessions is a horrible choice for this particular position, especially as an attorney general who is supposed to uphold some of the most important ideals of the constitution.
MELBER: Sarah, what is your response to that? And how does the senator address that history from the first confirmation hearing?
SARAH ISGURFLORES, SESSIONS CONFIRMATION SPOKESMAN: Well, I mean, I think it`s pretty clear that the leftist playbook at this point only has one page, and it`s smear. I didn`t hear a lot of facts there. I heard a lot of allegations. And I heard a lot of general statements about smearing him. 30 years ago, Jeff Sesions was in a Senate hearing where the Democrats practiced their playbook that they would use against Bork.
We now have a verb for it, Borking someone, it means smearing them without any basis. The person who was a witness against Jeff Sessions under oath later had to recant his testimony because the conversations he remembered were disprovable later.
This idea that Ted Kennedy somehow in his statement should hold now -- Ted Kennedy has worked with Jeff Sessions, passed legislation with Jeff Sessions, so has Dick Durbin. It`s why Joe Manchin said he`s going to vote for him.
We have senators, Democrats and Republicans, up in 2018 who are only too happy with the work that Jeff Sessions has done throughout his career. 20 years in the Senate. So, you know what, Democrats are going to do what they`re going to do. They`re going to say what they always say. It didn`t work in 2016 for Hillary Clinton, and it`s not going to work now. Jeff Sessions will make a fantastic attorney general who will uphold the rule of law, something that our previous attorney generals under this administration have been sorely lacking.
Oh, by the way, Jeff Sessions confirmed -- voted to confirm Eric Holder.
MELBER: Let me go, Christina, then Howard and back to Sarah.
GREER: So, Senator Sessions in 30 years has made a good choice in upholding Eric Holder who he, and Loretta Lynch, maybe two of the greatest attorney generals in the history of this nation.
But this is straight out of the Republican playbook in the sense that Donald Trump is pulling out a whole bunch of has-beens and never-wases and people who represent the worst part of American Democracy. They do not believe in equality. We know that these people believe that he consistently chooses believe in segregationist tactics. This is not a smear campaign.
FLORES: I`m sorry. That`s a lot of smear -- where are the facts? Excuse me, that is a lie. No facts.
GREER: ...if we read, and we know that the president-elect does not like to do so and he said so on record. But if we read, we know that this particular individual has gone out of his way, the majority of his career, to make sure that black Americans specifically are disenfranchised.
FLORES: That`s not true.
MELBER: All right, let me give Sarah a response, and then I want to bring Governor Dean who are waiting his turn. Go ahead, Sarah.
FLORES: I don`t know how to respond to something when there`s no facts there. No, he hasn`t.
MELBER: Governor Dean, go ahead?
HOWARD DEAN, FMR. DNC CHAIRMAN: There are some facts there in terms of the quotes that you can actually get that Jeff Sessions has actually said.
I`m more interested in the process here. If Manchin has said that he`s going to support Sessions, then you need four Republican -- four -- excuse me, four Republican vote against him. And this is -- they`ve targeted eight, the Democrats in the Senate have targeted eight people. They`re going to have to get at least three Republican votes, in this case four.
And the way to do that is to target the senators, the Republican senators who have to run for reelection in 2018, and you`re not going to get all of these eight. So I don`t want to make any predictions about, which ones you are going to get, but you`re going to have to show to a significant number of these senators` constituents that there`s going to be a penalty for voting for some of the people they want to target.
And I think they will get one or two of them, but I certainly don`t think they`re oging to get all eight of them.
MELBER: And governor, what do you think about -- what do you think about Rex Tillerson who seems to be the one where there is most motion, because there`s so much controversy and questions about Russia and then he also has some links there that the Trump folks argue are positive, because he`s been a businessman in the region, other folks argue, question his impartiality.
DEAN: Well, I know very little about Rex Tillerson, so I don`t have a particular comment about whether he should be the secretary of state or not. But there will be an incredibly thorough vetting of these vocation, there always is, no matter which side is doing the vetting. The senate is badly divided, it didn`t used to be a body like the House, but it is now. I can`t predict what`s going to happen. Somebody is going to find something, or they are not going to find something in Rex Tillerson`s resume that is going to be condemning.
If he doesn`t give documents like his full tax returns, that`s going to be a problem. But again, the only way to stop the confirmations of any of these folks is to find a constituency in the state of some senator that`s a Republican senator.
MELBER: Sarah and Christina, I have 20 seconds for each of you. Sarah first.
FLORES: Ari, nobody watching this show right now thinks that the Democrats actually will stop these confirmations. This is about delay. This is about playing politics with this. And nobody believes that if Hillary Clinton had won this election, that the Democrats would be trying to delay these confirmations until March.
I don`t know why. I don`t think it will help them in 2018. I think Republicans will win more seats.
MELBER: And Christina.
GREER: If Hillary Clinton had won, she would actually nominate people who were legitimate and didn`t seek to dismantle the very offices they`re put in charge of. Every single person that Donald Trump has put -- has nominated actually wants to roll back the clock, when we think about energy, when we think about housing, when we think about the attorney general.
MELBER: Sarah, Howard, Christina, lively, informative, thank you all.
Good evening to you. I`m Ari Melber. That is ALL IN for this evening. ""THE RACHEL MADDOW SHOW"" starts right now.
THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED."
0	70	 71 von 72	MSNBC	January 2, 2017 Monday	 HARDBALL	 5:00 PM EST	"HIGHLIGHT: President-elect Trump again questions the intelligence community`s conclusion that Russia interfered with the U.S. elections, and he teased what he himself might reveal about the subject. A new Congress comes to Washington tomorrow and with it a sweeping conservative agenda that threatens to kill much of President Obama`s legacy.

"	"CHRIS MATTHEWS, HOST: The coming of Trump.
Let`s play HARDBALL.
Good evening. I`m Chris Matthews, back in Washington.
Well, we`re at the start of a very busy month politically, of course, a transformative one for the country. In just 18 days, Donald Trump will be sworn in, like it or not, actually as the 45th president of the United States. Get that into your head.
Today, President Obama returned from vacation in Hawaii with the obvious goal of trying to protect his legacy, which is now an endangered political species. The White House announced the president will deliver his last major address next week from Chicago.
President-elect Trump returned to New York today from his vacation, and he continued tweeting today. He suggested there might be a role for the federal government in combating Chicago`s soaring number of murders, 762 this past year. 
And he criticized what he called ""media outlets and pundits"" for suggesting he himself thought he was going to lose the election. Well, coming up on the show, I`ll be talking to the newly appointed counselor to the incoming president, Kellyanne Conway.
We begin tonight with the pending question about the next commander-in- chief. What does Donald Trump know that he won`t -- or that we don`t, and what does Donald Trump know that President Obama and the U.S. intelligence community doesn`t know?
Well, over the weekend, President-elect Trump again questioned the intelligence community`s conclusion that Russia interfered with the U.S. elections, and he teased what he might reveal about that topic this week. Let`s watch him.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENT-ELECT: I just want them to be sure because it`s a pretty serious charge. And I want them to be sure. And if you look at the weapons of mass destruction -- that was a disaster and they were wrong. And so I want them to be sure. I think it`s unfair if they don`t know. And I know a lot about hacking and hacking is a very hard thing to prove. So it could be somebody else. And I also know things that other people don`t know. And so they cannot be sure of this situation.
QUESTION: What do you know that other people don`t know?
TRUMP: You`ll find out on Tuesday or Wednesday.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
MATTHEWS: Well, what is he referring to coming Tuesday or Wednesday? I`m going to be joined, by the way, tonight on this program by NBC`s Kristen -- well, I`m being joined right now by Kristen Welker. I`m going to be joined by Kellyanne Conway later on the show.
Kristen, you`re right there. Do we have any indication that Trump`s going to make good on this commitment to show us, this show-and-tell tomorrow or the next day, what he knows that no one else apparently knows about the possibility of Russia, I assume, not being the ones who hacked into our political situation this past election?
KRISTEN WELKER, NBC CORRESPONDENT: Well, look, that`s what he is saying, Chris. And we know that he`s going to have an intelligence briefing this week. And, certainly, we are going to keep asking. You heard the reporter pressing him for more information there when he spoke to them over the weekend. We`ve been pressing his top officials for more information, but they continue to punt and make the argument that he wants to be sure before making a final assessment that it was, in fact, Russia.
But look, the takeaway here, Chris, is that again, you have an incoming commander-in-chief questioning his intelligence community. You heard him pointing to the weapons of mass destruction there. That`s something that really gets under the skin of intelligence officials. And he`s also setting up a potential battle with members of Congress, members of his own party, hawks like John McCain and Lindsey Graham, who are calling for more sanctions and who are essentially saying that they believe U.S. intelligence officials when they say that Russia is behind those hacks that we saw during the 2016 race.
And in fact,Senator John McCain set to hold a hearing on the matter on Thursday. So it`s setting up this situation, Chris, for President-elect Trump, who`s trying to sort of to move on from this topic, but the hawks in his party not letting it go. Could be the first big battle when he takes office in just 18 days from now.
MATTHEWS: Well, of course, we`ve had experience -- Kristen, you and I and everybody else on the -- in the Western world has heard Trump say he`s got private investigators out learning all kinds of thing about...
WELKER: Right.
MATTHEWS: ... President Obama`s real birth and that sort of thing. So we`ve been through this sort of situation. What is Trump really going to try to -- he`s very good at, as somebody said the other day, creating rabbits for us to chase every week. What`s the rabbit this week? What is Trump going to do this week to focus media attention? Do we know yet?
WELKER: Well, I don`t. And it`s a good question. I mean, earlier this evening, he tweeted about North Korea and the fact that he will prevent them from getting a nuclear weapon. (sic) As you talked about, he talked about -- he tweeted about violence in Chicago.
We didn`t see a whole lot of him today. He was sort of huddled indoors here at Trump Tower. It was a quieter day. I`m told he`s going to have more transition-related meetings tomorrow.
But again, Chris, bottom line he did make that statement that he`s going to produce more information. And certainly, the press corps is going to hold him to that and his top officials within his administration, Chris.
MATTHEWS: We`re all waiting for that. Thank you, Kristen Welker, for doing this. And get in from the rain! Oh, my God, where you always stand out in front of that Tower!
(LAUGHTER)
Anyway, Donald Trump praised Vladimir Putin`s decision today not to respond to the Obama administration`s punitive actions announced last week. Well, Trump tweeted the following. ""Great move on delay by V. Putin. I always knew he was very smart.""
Anyway, today, Trump`s incoming press secretary, Sean Spicer, suggested that President Obama`s response was politicizing intelligence and that it was shooting from the hip. Let`s watch him.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
SEAN SPICER, INCOMING WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: This report that everyone see as taking as gospel truth right now is not even final. It`s not supposed to be finalized until later this week. So there are questions as to why we`re taking the actions that we`re talking in the proportion that we are without the report even being finalized.
The president-elect is going to wait until the information is final, until he can make the clearest judgment on what to do in the best interests of this country. What he`s not going to do is politicize intelligence and decide to shoot from the hip before he has a complete picture of what`s happening.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
MATTHEWS: OK, I`m joined right now by ""USA Today`s"" Washington bureau chief Susan Page and global editorial director for the HuffingtonPost Howard Fineman. Both of you, thank you. You are the pros.
We got to get used to this, by the way, Trump reality.
SUSAN PAGE, ""USA TODAY"": You know what`s going to...
MATTHEWS: He simply dictates it`s not the Russians and we have to sort of walk around that statement.
PAGE: Here`s what`s going to be different, though. After he`s inaugurated, we`re going to be able to judge not just what he tweets or what he says, but what he does and what the impact of that is. And I think this is going to require some discipline on the part of journalists...
MATTHEWS: Yes.
PAGE: ... to cover what he actually does and the impact of that, as opposed to what that morning`s tweet (INAUDIBLE)
MATTHEWS: How do you avoid chasing the rabbits he releases every day?
PAGE: Well, you can`t not chase the rabbit, right? You have a responsibility to chase the rabbit, too, but...
MATTHEWS: Like, I`m going to pick Mitt Romney for two weeks.
PAGE: Right. But you have a bigger responsibility, I think, to focus on the substance of what he does and what impact it has because after he`s inaugurated, that is going to be what matters. And that`s what`s going to matter to the people who put him in office.
MATTHEWS: And let`s start with this one. Every time he lambastes -- or lambasts, however you pronounce it -- the intelligence community by saying they got it wrong on Iraq, no one in the intelligence community, like the CIA, defense intelligence said that Saddam Hussein had nuclear weapons. One person said that. His name`s Dick Cheney. And he was followed by his band of neocons.
So the -- it`s not exactly right for Trump to keep saying the CIA was wrong about that, so don`t trust them about the Russian hacking.
HOWARD FINEMAN, HUFFINGTON POST GLOBAL EDITORIAL DIR., MSNBC POLITICAL ANALYST: Well, there was...
MATTHEWS: It`s just not accurate.
FINEMAN: There was that ""slam dunk"" phrase that was used back in the day.
MATTHEWS: By -- yes...
FINEMAN: By George Tenet.
MATTHEWS: ... about -- not about nuclear.
FINEMAN: Yes.
MATTHEWS: He was always careful about that.
FINEMAN: Yes, well...
MATTHEWS: Go ahead.
FINEMAN: I think -- I think...
MATTHEWS: And nuclear is the reason...
FINEMAN: OK...
MATTHEWS: ... most the middle of the road people said, Let`s go to war with Iraq because we thought they did have a nuclear weapon.
FINEMAN: Sure . For Sean Spicer to accuse the Democrats of -- and the media of sort of playing politics with it I think obscures the larger point, which is it serves Donald Trump`s interests to keep his own personal interests and his own leadership style to intimidate everybody around him and to keep them divided and at war with each other.
He`s putting the intelligence community on notice, as only Donald Trump can do, in public, You guys screwed up before. I don`t necessarily believe you. And he`s trying to discredit...
MATTHEWS: Why does he do that?
FINEMAN: Well, I think partly, it`s a method of control for Donald Trump.
MATTHEWS: But you`ve got your G-2 out there -- if you`re a military guy, you depend every day, every hour on your intelligence guy.
FINEMAN: Well...
MATTHEWS: And how -- how`s he going to run the world...
FINEMAN: Like Richard Nixon long ago, who also was very wary of his own intel people going in as president of the United States...
MATTHEWS: Because they were all Ivy Leaguers and he resented them.
FINEMAN: He resented them, and I think...
MATTHEWS: Yes.
FINEMAN: And I think Donald Trump, for his own reasons -- and I`m not sure what they all are -- is putting them on the defensive, people like Michael Hayden, who used to be a key figure in the Bush era of intel, thinks that the crowd that Donald Trump has put around him are basically lunatics.
MATTHEWS: Let`s get to something...
FINEMAN: Basically lunatics.
MATTHEWS: We`re getting close to the lunatic question here. Right now, late today, Donald Trump tweeted a warning to North Korea. And there you`re talking real lunacy over there. ""North Korea just stated that it is in the final stages of developing a nuclear weapon capable of reaching parts of the U.S. It won`t happen.""
OK. Well, this is question I`ve been thinking about. I was away for two weeks, and I`ve been thinking about one question that scarier than anything else going on right now, Kim Jong-un, the guy with haircut, the guy that nobody walks up and say, You look a little strange today. Oh, beautiful haircut. I mean, he`s surrounded by sycophants.
He`s building a nuclear weapon. He`s building a missile capable of reaching Seattle. What`s to stop that little finger from pushing the button?
PAGE: And of course, one concern I think that some policy makers have is that he is able to be provoked and he has a history...
MATTHEWS: Which guy?
(CROSSTALK)
MATTHEWS: The guy in Pyongyang or the guy in New York?
(LAUGHTER)
PAGE: Speaking of the North Korean leader. But he has a history of being provoked and doing provocative things and pressing (ph) the envelope at key moments, for instance, example, the inauguration of a new president. So I think there`s some...
MATTHEWS: So you`re talking about that Kim Jong-un might try something.
PAGE: Might try something. It would be within his pattern of behavior to try something around the time of the inauguration.
MATTHEWS: OK, you`re president...
PAGE: And he -- and when he reads a tweet like that, it has the possibility of...
MATTHEWS: Of tweeting him.
PAGE: ... igniting something.
MATTHEWS: Howard, you`re president-elect. I`m going to ask you the same question, so here goes. You`re president-elect. You`re surrounded by newcomers to security. You`ve got to go to people right now that are going to tell you, What are my options? Do I call the leaders in China? (INAUDIBLE) you got to call this guy down to the principal`s office. You got to warn him, If anything like this even happens, it`s not about trading nuclear weapons, it`s about this guy`s very sad, quick, tragic end on this planet. And how do you get that message across to this numbskull?
FINEMAN: Well -- well, having -- having just publicly attempted to trash the intelligence community, he now has to go to the intelligence community...
MATTHEWS: Right.
FINEMAN: ... and ask...
MATTHEWS: What have we got?
FINEMAN: ... (INAUDIBLE) advice.
MATTHEWS: Deterrence doesn`t work!
FINEMAN: Donald Trump, from what I can tell -- and I`ve been around him now for a while, and I`ve studied him for longer than that -- believes in his own circle of people to tell him what he should do. One of those people who`s become part of that circle is Henry Kissinger. Henry Kissinger`s been around for a long time. He knows how to...
(CROSSTALK)
MATTHEWS: ... on the phone with him yet and say, Be careful here?
FINEMAN: I know that he`s talked to Donald Trump. I can`t say within the last 24 hours, but absolutely he has. Donald Trump wants his own people. You talk about somebody who might be surrounded by people who want to tell him what he wants to hear...
MATTHEWS: OK.
FINEMAN: ... about a guy with a short fuse...
MATTHEWS: OK...
FINEMAN: We`re talking about both places potentially.
MATTHEWS: I worked in politics long enough to know that when somebody is sick with a grave disease, they don`t go to their best friends, they find out -- if they got to go on Google, they got to go (INAUDIBLE) richest (ph), smartest people they know, Tell me who`s the best doctor for this? That`s almost the situation Trump`s in now. He needs to find a specialist who`s going to help him deal with Kim Jong-un and this nuclear delivery system of his he`s just announced.
PAGE: And yet with any administration, incoming administration, even one that`s more conventional than the Trump administration, this is a risky period at the very beginning of an administration because they don`t have all their kinks worked out yet. They don`t even have all their positions filled. The national security adviser, General Flynn, would be important in any discussion like that. He`ll have just taken over his job, too.
MATTHEWS: Yes.
PAGE: So it raises a lot of concerns. And it`s one reason that you want to have as smooth a transition as possible so that if there`s a crisis, one person you might call would be Barack Obama.
MATTHEWS: So will the Democrats let him have his security team in place by January 20th?
FINEMAN: Well, I would hope so. But Susan raises a good point. Despite the superficial public handshaking that President Obama and President-elect Trump did in the Oval Office the other week...
MATTHEWS: Sure.
FINEMAN: I mean, we have an extraordinary thing going on where there are basically presidencies competing here. I`ve never seen anything quite like it. Maybe the last time it happened was -- I was too young to be covering it, which was Richard Nixon and Lyndon Johnson. You`ve got a similar kind of situation here. It`s not the Vietnam war that they`re arguing over, but it`s an entire array of things. One would hope...
MATTHEWS: OK...
FINEMAN: ... that they put that aside right now...
MATTHEWS: Well, let`s see who`s not putting it aside. Donald Trump in a New Year`s message for those he called his ""enemies"" this weekend. He tweeted, ""Happy new year to all, including my many enemies and those who have fought me and lost so badly, they just don`t know what to do. Love.""
Susan, was that a statement of unity?
PAGE: You know, it`s not a statement of unity. And also, isn`t -- aren`t they his opponents, not his enemies, because...
MATTHEWS: Rivals even.
PAGE: ... we`re all Americans, you know?
MATTHEWS: I know. You just said it with a little bit of lilt, like Bill Clinton.
FINEMAN: The same reason...
MATTHEWS: He doesn`t have any lilt to his voice these days!
FINEMAN: No, and I think -- I think you can -- you can see what kind of president Donald Trump is going to be, in addition to the campaign itself, by the tweets that he`s put out in this interregnum. Yes, we don`t want to chase the rabbits, but these are significant rabbits.
What he`s doing unprovoked is basically sticking his finger in the eye of the people he beat for the presidency and trying to keep them down. He`s also said, you know, My supporters, my really passionate supporters...
MATTHEWS: Yes.
FINEMAN: ... are very quiet right now, but they can be riled up at any moment. I mean, he is laying down various markers of how he`s going to run...
MATTHEWS: OK...
FINEMAN: ... the country, and if he has to, intimidate people.
MATTHEWS: Susan, last question. He did show during the campaign -- and we`re going to have Kellyanne on tonight, Kellyanne Conway -- during the campaign, discipline. He showed when he was really down in the dumps -- and let`s remember that, if he`s forgotten -- where it looked like he was the sure loser, after the tapes came out of the bus ride -- he did discipline himself. There is controls on his control panel. He can say, OK, now, no tweets for three or four days.
PAGE: He won the nomination. We didn`t think he could do that. He won the White House. We didn`t think he could do that. He clearly has shrewd political instincts. But you have to say that we haven`t seen the kind of effort to reach out to the people who didn`t vote for him during this period...
MATTHEWS: He doesn`t seem to need them. They`ve got 51 votes, and 50 votes in the Senate is enough. And they`ve got -- they`re going to use reconciliation, not the usual human kind, the legislative kind. He doesn`t think he needs them.
FINEMAN: If there...
MATTHEWS: Anyway...
FINEMAN: If there`s a traditional rule, he won`t follow it.
MATTHEWS: OK. Thank you, Howard Fineman. That is a rather colossal statement (INAUDIBLE) we`ll leave it with you.
FINEMAN: It`s true.
MATTHEWS: It was big-time, Howard.
(LAUGHTER)
MATTHEWS: Susan, thank you, and Howard.
Coming up right now, I`m going to ask Trump senior Kelly -- well, ""senior Kelly"" -- senior counselor Kellyanne Conway about what Trump might know about this Russian hacking. Also how he`s going to deal with this North Korean craziness and how he plans to lead the country, of course. And that`s ahead.
Coming up here on HARDBALL, Kellyanne Conway.
By the way, as Trump looks to Russia, he ought to know what Putin wants -- what does Putin want? -- and how he expects to get his way with Trump. Those are, of course, major questions that will shape the world for the next four years.
And starting tomorrow in Washington, this city becomes where the action is. President Obama is back. So is the Republican Congress eager to kill Obama`s legacy. Can Democrats stop them?
Finally, ""Let Me Finish"" with my two weeks in the ancient land, believe it or not, of India. That`s where I`ve been! Talk about a far-off place.
This is HARDBALL, the place for politics.
MATTHEWS: Well, Did you hear? Donald Trump had one of his most critical biographers ejected from his private golf course this weekend. According to Politico, Harry Hurt -- that`s his name -- was playing in a foursome with Republican mega-donor David Koch. And here`s what Harry Hurt said happened on the golf course. Let`s watch.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
HARRY HURT, TRUMP BIOGRAPHER: I went up to him, and you know, in the spirit of United States of America and said, Congratulations, sir. And then he launched into a diatribe that I had been rough on him. He used an expletive to describe the content of my book. I looked him the eye and I said, It`s all true. And he said, Not in the way you said it. I can`t believe why you`re here. And I said, Well, I came with David Koch. Well, he said, I think it`s inappropriate for you to play here and I want you to leave. And so I said fine, and we left.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
MATTHEWS: Is that how you dress down in Palm Beach? Anyway, we`ll be right back after this.
MATTHEWS: Welcome back to HARDBALL.
In 18 days, when he is sworn in as the 45th president of the United States, Donald Trump will face a divided country, obviously, and a world of conflicts out there. How will he deal with Russia, the Middle East and other major flash points?
Kellyanne Conway was Trump`s campaign manager. She will now serve -- she is now serving as counselor. She will actually have the title of the counselor to the president in the White House.
Kellyanne, congratulations.
KELLYANNE CONWAY, TRUMP SENIOR ADVISER: Thank you.
MATTHEWS: As you noted me today on the phone when we talked to get ready for tonight, you pointed out -- and I think somebody ought to advertise this -- you`re one of three women who have ever held the very high of position of counselor to the president. Tell us more.
CONWAY: And all of them were Republicans. There`s never been a Democratic woman with that title, Chris.
MATTHEWS: Which tells you?
CONWAY: Just a little piece of useful trivia.
It tells you yet again Donald Trump has been promoting and elevating woman in the Trump corporation, the Trump campaign, the Cabinet and the Trump administration. It`s just who he is. It`s what he does.
MATTHEWS: Well, you have got an amazing position. You`re going to be in the Oval Office a lot with the president.
And let me just ask you about what scares me. I was away for two weeks over in India, and I was reading the papers. Actually, they have a good- English language press over there. And I`m reading about Trump and everything that is going on.
And one thing that bugs me and scares me, because it`s not about something we can argue about and go back and forth, raise taxes, lower them -- a lot of this is back and forth over four years, eight years. A lot of things can be fixed that are broken.
But one thing that scares all of us is a nuclear attack by a country. How do you stop somebody as weird as Kim Jong-un, that weirdly haircutted guy from North Korea, who is surrounded by sycophants, and no one is going to tell him the truth, how does Donald Trump stop him from arming and launching or even deploying a missile capable of delivering a nuclear weapon to Seattle?
How do you stop him from doing that? You can punish him afterwards, blow the hell out of that country, but what you can stop him from doing it?
CONWAY: Well, as you pointed out, the president-elect just in the last hour, Chris, has tweeted out the notice that North Korea is about a year away from having this described missile and that Donald Trump ended that by saying not going to happen.
So, he is focused on this. He will have a plan. He will confer with his generals and his other security -- his security officials. And he will take action.
I`ll tell you how you don`t it. You don`t do it by having the policies of the last eight years. You don`t do it by emboldening a country like Iran and its nuclear capability, which has put the U.S. and Israel and frankly the rest of the world in direct risk. I think that`s even why prominent Democratic senators like Bob Menendez of New Jersey and our own Chuck Schumer here in New York were against that Iran nuclear deal.
So, the idea that we have been increasing the capability, the nuclear capability, of a country like Iran and then we are questioning North Korea`s capability is somewhat rich. But that`s in part why President Obama`s former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton lost the election and a guy who is going to be much tougher on these issues, Donald Trump, won the election.
MATTHEWS: Well, we had a global sanctions regime against Iran, which forced them to the negotiating table. And you may not end like the plan, but at least it puts them off in terms of their ability to develop a nuclear weapon.
What negotiation with Pyongyang, with the North Koreas would serve that purpose? If you don`t have worldwide sanctions against them with the Chinese involved cutting them off from any economic life, what do you do to stop them? You squeeze them, you squeeze them, you squeeze them, then what do you do in.
CONWAY: Well, let me just back up a second when you talk about the sanctions on the Iran deal.
Fine, except remember that we`re also -- they also have so much money now and they are funding groups like Hezbollah. In other words, it`s not just as simple as the Iran nuclear deal or as simple as the $100 million per four people in Iran, which of course is what it was, even though they lied at the beginning.
The world is a dangerous place. But, look, we`re not going to make foreign policy and national security pronouncements on your show tonight. The president-elect is not doing that until he is sworn into office.
But clearly this is a roiling part of the Obama legacy. And I would be curious to see what President Obama says in his -- quote -- ""farewell address"" in Chicago about issues like this. Maybe he won`t even address them.
But when you say the world is a dangerous place, it didn`t just happen. And it`s because of a lot of action and inaction. And I appropriate the fact that president-elect Trump through his very powerful social media platform in just the last hour, Chris, is telling 44 million people on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram combined and then the whole media that has to pick up these comments that he intends to stop it and he will.
(CROSSTALK)
MATTHEWS: I agree. Look, I think that was a concern before he did it. But I agree he`s focused on what is to me and many people the biggest concern we have.
Let`s talk about setting the tone. You say you don`t want to make policy. But let`s talk about the tone. He is clearly setting a very different tone from Obama with regard to Russia and the allegations of Russia`s hacking into the campaign.
And earlier in the month, Mr. Trump questioned whether Russia was in fact responsible. Let`s start with that. Here we go.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENT-ELECT: The hacking is very interesting. Once they hack, if you don`t catch them in the act, you`re not going to catch them.
They have no idea if it`s Russia or China or somebody. It could be somebody sitting in a bed someplace. Personally, it could be Russia. I done really think it is. But who knows? I don`t know either. They don`t know. And I don`t know.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
MATTHEWS: Well, last week, the president-elect said we should just move on. Let`s watch that.

TRUMP: I think we ought to get on with our lives. I think the computers have complicated lives very greatly. You know, the whole age of computer has made it where nobody knows exactly what`s going on. We have speed, we have a lot of other things, but I`m not sure we have the kind of security that we need.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
MATTHEWS: Well, as I showed you earlier, Donald Trump this weekend suggested there was information out there that hasn`t been revealed yet that could change the whole situation. Let`s watch him on this.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
TRUMP: I know a lot about hacking, and hacking is a very hard thing to prove. So it could be somebody else. And I also know things that other people don`t know. And so they cannot be sure of the situation.
QUESTION: What do you know that other people don`t know?
TRUMP: You will find out on Tuesday or Wednesday.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
MATTHEWS: Is that still a go, Kellyanne? We`re going to hear tomorrow or the next day about what the president-elect knows about hacking?
CONWAY: Well, you may.
The key to all of that, Chris, is that the president-elect, in addition to the comments that he made there, I was there when he made them down in Palm Beach, he has agreed to have an intelligence briefing. And he will have that here at Trump Tower this week.
And he will hear from our top intelligence officials, it is expected, what they know.
MATTHEWS: Well, what does he know?
(CROSSTALK)
CONWAY: Well, he knows things I hope that every president, in this case president-elect, who have presidential intelligence briefings and have other intelligence briefings, I hope they know a whole lot more than the rest of us know, because they should. They are the president and commander, president of the United States and commander in chief.
But the other point he`s making here and I would like to make on his behalf is, we don`t want politics to interfere with intelligence. And people are saying we don`t want intelligence efforts to interfere with our politics, those who are still fighting the last war of November 8.
But we also don`t want politics to play into our intelligence efforts either. And the fact is, I think those who are still talking about the hacking, they fall into two big categories. One are people who don`t like the content of the e-mails that were revealed, where Hillary`s own team was questioning her judgment, calling Chelsea Clinton a spoiled brat.
There`s a lot of uncomfortableness in those e-mails.
MATTHEWS: Let me tell you what I`m focused on.
And that is Donald Trump has said that basically the intelligence community blew it with regard to the war in Iraq. And I agree with him about the war in Iraq. We shouldn`t have fought it.
But it wasn`t the intelligence community. It`s what you just described now, the politicizing of the intelligence. It was Dick Cheney and the others, the neocons, who never had any briefing from the CIA that said that Saddam Hussein had nuclear weapons.
But Donald -- Dick Cheney went out there as vice president, who was a credible guy, and told the world, yes, they did have nuclear weapons.
So, it wasn`t the intelligence community, who Donald Trump is now blaming. It was the ideologues around President George W. Bush that did it. They lied. They put the word out. They didn`t have a basis for saying.
It`s all in the record. We have the guy on the show saying he briefed Dick Cheney and the president and never told them that they had nuclear weapons over there. But it was a good way to get us into the war.
So, I think Donald Trump -- I will just say this. I think Donald Trump is wrong to blame the intelligence community. He should blame the politicizing of intelligence, which you`re talking about.
CONWAY: Well, perhaps he is, though, Chris.
In fairness to president-elect Trump, he has been very critical of the Iraq War. He has said it as president-elect. He said it as a candidate. He`s very critical. And of course Hillary Clinton voted for it. She ran down to the well of the Senate floor and proudly cast her vote for it.
Let me focus on the current issue at hand, too, though. President Obama has said that he told Vladimir Putin earlier this year to -- quote -- ""knock it off"" when it came to hacking. It`s not clear that he meant knock it off because you`re going to interfere with the election, just knock it off.
And why was that enough? Knock it off is when I say to my kids when they`re having a skirmish in the car. You don`t say to Vladimir Putin knock it off and think that he will and then somehow find your tougher side and expel these 35 Russian operatives. It doesn`t make any sense.
And it`s incongruous to a lot of the American people, who wonder why more wasn`t done earlier. Was it because President Obama and everybody at the networks thought Hillary Clinton would win? Was this is a diplomatic response or a political response? And I think many Americans have a legitimate question there.
MATTHEWS: Well, let me ask you last question for some news. And I do want you to make news here, Kellyanne.
I want to have one question. Are we going to move our embassy to Jerusalem?
CONWAY: Possibly.
MATTHEWS: Possibly.
CONWAY: President-elect Trump has said it`s a big priority. It`s a priority to him. He would like to do it. And the reason is very simple.
Chris, when you show at the -- at the Israeli equivalent of our Supreme Court, at the Knesset, or to see the prime minister, you go to Jerusalem. So, don`t you want our embassy to be where the seat of government is?
There is no peace plan on the table ever that does not include Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.
MATTHEWS: But the Arab side is that Jerusalem will also be the capital of a new Palestinian state. And they take it as serious that we would move our embassy there to Jerusalem, to state that it is Israel`s exclusive territory.
And no U.S. president has said that, that Jerusalem is entirely Israelis`. That`s just a fact, and it`s going to cause trouble. I just want to know.
CONWAY: Right.
MATTHEWS: But you say it may happen. You`re not sure it`s going to happen.
CONWAY: No, what I`m telling you is, is that it`s a priority for the president-elect. He has said it many times.
(CROSSTALK)
MATTHEWS: Yes, I know. Many presidents have said that.
CONWAY: His new ambassador to Israel has said so.
All I want to tell you is, if there`s no peace plan on the table -- and we all know that we`re nowhere close to having a peace process completed here -- if there`s no peace that doesn`t contemplate Jerusalem as being the capital of Israel, then why wouldn`t we want our embassy there? Why don`t you want the U.S. Embassy...
(CROSSTALK)
MATTHEWS: Well, the same reason Ronald Reagan threatened to veto any action by Congress to do that. Because it would cause an explosion. Thoughtful people have said this is a very dangerous thing to do.
(CROSSTALK)
CONWAY: But I can`t let that go about the explosiveness of the Middle East and of course of our best friend in the Middle East by far, Israel, without commenting on recent events.
The U.N. -- abstaining the U.N. resolution was a break with U.S. policy and certainly Israeli policy.
I mean, John Kerry`s 72-minute speech was a tirade against Israel. The idea that it`s not the rejectionism of the Palestinians alone -- the idea that it`s -- it`s -- it`s Jewish people building apartments, and not the rejectionism, why don`t we have a peace process, I mean, in other words, this is a very -- this is a very complex issue.
But you`re going to have a president there for probably eight years. We now have one for the next 18 days. And to do this on the way out, to break with the longstanding Israeli and U.S. policy, I think, is shameful.
(CROSSTALK)
MATTHEWS: Kellyanne Conway, I can also top that and say that U.S. policy under both parties from the beginning has been to try to find peace between the Arab people and the Israeli people in Palestine, in that area, and to try to bring peace.
CONWAY: Yes. Yes.
MATTHEWS: And part of that has been a two-state solution agreed to by both political parties and to stop the settlements, which cut off the chance to have a real Palestinian state. It has been consistent.
CONWAY: And no one has succeeded. No Republican or Democrat president has succeeded.
And President Obama didn`t even visit Israel until the beginning of his second term.
MATTHEWS: OK. OK. Well, it`s politics.
Anyway, thank you, Kellyanne Conway, for coming on HARDBALL again.
CONWAY: Thank you, Chris.
MATTHEWS: Up next: Donald Trump continues to side with Vladimir Putin over the Russian hacking allegations, so what`s Putin looking to for the next four years? What`s he up to? We`re going to get a closer look at Putin and what he wants out of Trump .
And this is HARDBALL, the place for politics.
MATTHEWS: Welcome back to HARDBALL.
Well, after last week`s expulsion of 35 Russian diplomats, U.S. relations with Russia are their worst level since the `70s. Donald Trump has vowed to change that, promising a rapprochement with his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin.
The feeling is mutual. Last week in his annual New Year`s statement, Vladimir Putin congratulated Trump on his election and expressed new hope for U.S.-Russian relations, writing: ""Acting in a constructive and pragmatic manner, we will be able to take real steps to restore the mechanism of bilateral cooperation in various areas.""
Not everybody is on board.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
SEN. JOHN MCCAIN (R), ARIZONA: Here is a fundamental fact. And we may get to this later on. Vladimir Putin is thug and a murderer and a killer and a KGB agent.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
MATTHEWS: Well, for more on who President Putin is really and where he wants to take American friendship, if you will, I`m joined by Simon Marks, president and chief correspondent of Feature Story News, and Garry Kasparov, chairman of the Human Rights Foundation, the Russian pro- democracy leader, and former world-class world chess companion, of course. He`s the author of ""Winter Is Coming: Why Vladimir Putin and the Enemies of the Free World Must Be Stopped.""
Mr. Kasparov, thank you. It`s an honor to have you on.
I just want to get the big question out of you, which is, what is Putin up to, no matter who our president is, and what is the particular use he is going to try to make of Trump? rMDNM_
GARRY KASPAROV, AUTHOR, ""WINTER IS COMING"": Well, Putin wants what every dictator wants, to stay in power for the rest of his life.
And, today, confrontation with the free world, confrontation with the United States has become the staple of domestic propaganda. Economy is falling apart, so that is why Putin is relying heavily on his propaganda machine. And confrontation is a very important element of justifying his endless stay in power.
MATTHEWS: Well, Simon, that sounds like Castro did for 40 years. Justify his hold on the country`s tyranny by saying the United States is out to get him.
SIMON MARKS, FEATURE STORY NEWS: Look, I think Garry is right. There`s no question that Vladimir Putin envisages staying in power.
(CROSSTALK)
MATTHEWS: Well, so does Netanyahu. A lot of these guys, a lot of politicians have a plan like that.
MARKS: No question about that, but I think his plan goes further than that.
He is also all about trying to restore what he argues is Russia`s historic sense of greatness He`s about degrading American...
(CROSSTALK)
MATTHEWS: OK. Talk about that part. How does dumping on our democracy invading us, interrupting us, hacking Democratic National Committee stuff, how does that enhance the stature of Russia?
MARKS: Because it`s all designed to degrade America`s ability to project itself as a paragon of democratic virtue, to project itself, as successive presidents of the United States have done, as the indispensable nation.
So, you play around with the computer servers of the Democratic Party. You undermine the democratic institutions here. You run circles around Barack Obama in Syria. You accentuate your own role on the world stage, and you continue to denigrate and try and pull down America`s role there.
MATTHEWS: Mr. Kasparov, what does Putin envy about the United States? There`s something in his mind that resents our position in the world to this day. What is it?
KASPAROV: Again, for Putin to demonstrate its new stability and his greatness in Russia, he must defy the biggest power in the world, so the United States.
And, of course, he has to demonstrate that democracy is not a function of institute. Since he is probably sick and tired of playing this democratic window in Russian politics, so he wants to demonstrate that democracy doesn`t work elsewhere. And that`s why targeting United States, and by the way, almost every major European country supporting the ultra nationalist groups, supporting all groups that are trying to destroy the political status quo and creating a mess all over the place, it serves his agenda.
CHRIS MATTHEWS, MSNBC ANCHOR: What do you -- if you were Trump`s friend and you could get into his ear with some intelligence, what would you tell him that he might react to, that he`s being played, that Putin is using him? What would you say?
KASPAROV: Look, I`m already troubled with the first assumption, you know, being Mr. Trump`s friend. Look, I can offer advise to the president of the United States whoever he or she is, you know, they just have to look at what`s happened, you know, before, just learn something from history and it`s clear that any attempt to negotiate with Vladimir Putin is a disaster by definition. The moment you are at the bargain table with Putin, you already concede, you know, strategic interest of the United States and the free world.
MATTHEWS: Does he kill his enemy in Russia?
KASPAROV: Look, you know, you look at the list of journalists and political activists killed in Russia, and I -- of course, I mention my friend colleague, late Boris Nemtsov, who was murdered up in front of the Kremlin. You know, Putin is a dictator and he will do whatever to stay in power. And now, creating chaos all over the world is a part of his agenda and, unfortunately, the president-elect is seen by Putin as an ideal counterpart to spread it around.
MATTHEWS: So, he does worse than throwing people off his golf course, I guess.
SIMON MARKS, FEATURE STORY NEWS: Look, he and Donald Trump have something in common.
MATTHEWS: What?
MARKS: Neither of them expected to be where they are today. Vladimir Putin flocked from obscurity by Boris Yeltsin. Donald Trump, the winner in the upset election last year. But Vladimir Putin has been doing this a lot longer than Donald Trump, and if Donald Trump is not careful, he --
(CROSSTALK)
MATTHEWS: Beware of the man who rises to power on one suspender.
Anyway, thank you, Simon Marks. Thank you, Garry Kasparov. It`s great honor to have you on. Up next -- and, you too, of course, Simon.
Buckle up your seat belt, the new Republican Congress is bent -- well, it`s already bent you might say -- on burying President Obama`s legacy. Can Democrats stop him?
The HARDBALL roundtable is here to see what this fight is going to be like and it starts tomorrow.
You`re watching HARDBALL, the place for politics.
MATTHEWS: Welcome back to HARDBALL.
A new Congress comes to Washington tomorrow and with it a sweeping conservative agenda that threatens to kill much of President Obama`s legacy. Kill it. Republicans who are firmly in control of the House now, the Senate, in a few weeks, the White House, are eager to repeal the Affordable Care Act itself.
They want to defund Planned Parenthood. They want to cut taxes for business. They want to undo all kinds of environmental and financial regulations. They want to kill Dodd-Frank.
So, let`s bring in the HARDBALL roundtable with that sober statement.
Andrew Sullivan is the contributing editor of ""The New York Magazine"". April Ryan is White House correspondent to American Urban Radio Network. And more to say about April, she`s the author of ""At Mama`s Knee: Mothers and Race in Black and White America."" John Brabender is just another Republican strategist with nothing more to say about him.
Brabender, let me ask you about -- I know you`re all thinking you can make changes in Pennsylvania. But let`s talk about -- if you got the House, your party, and you got the Senate, you don`t have anymore filibuster requirements. You can get all these guys and women in the cabinet, you can kill almost everything in the Obama administration legacy by something called reconciliation, which means you only need 50 votes in the Senate, you don`t need 60 to break the filibuster.
What`s to stop, you guys, to put it bluntly from killing everything Obama did?
JOHN BRABENDER, REPULICAN STRATEGIST: Well, let`s be kind of honest. We keep acting like Obama has this incredible legacy and American people are so proud. They did just elect a Republican president --
MATTHEWS: So, you got a mandate.
BRABENDER: I`m not calling it a mandate. I`m saying it`s an agenda, though, that they supported, and it`s not like they were in love with Obamacare or any of these other --
(CROSSTALK)
MATTHEWS: I`m loving you (INAUDIBLE), I`m saying it obviously, just say yes, nothing can stop you guys?
BRABENDER: Well, I don`t think anything will stop us. But I think we can get greedy. There`s a difference. What we should start are with the most populist things like trade, let`s get some wins.
MATTHEWS: So, you wouldn`t kill Obamacare in its cradle.
BRABENDER: Not by itself. They better have a replacement.
MATTHEWS: That`s what I argue.
APRIL RYAN, AMERICAN URBAN RADIO NETWORK: And that`s what I`ve been hearing.
MATTHEWS: Be careful. Trent Lott warned you guys that.
RYAN: I heard that there`s a replacement piece. And I asked someone who is coming into the White House with the president-elect when he becomes president, they said that it`s going to be replaced. But we don`t know if --
(CROSSTALK)
MATTHEWS: Twenty million people depend on this.
RYAN: We don`t know --
BRABENDER: We can`t just talk --
(CROSSTALK)
RYAN: Thirty million actually. It`s 30 million actually. Twenty million who have not had insurance now have insurance and then the other 10 million are people who lost insurance, you know, during the year and became part of the ACA program.
ANDREW SULLIVAN, NEW YORK MAGAZINE: We have told they have a replacement for eight years and they have not been able to produce it.
RYAN: Exactly.
SULLIVAN: Because, in fact, Obamacare is like what Churchill said of democracy, it`s worst possible health care to the resistant, except for all the others. If you remove -- if you keep the most popular part of it and you remove the unpopular part, it will fall apart.
MATTHEWS: Of course.
SULLIVAN: Now, I don`t know what they`re going to do about this. I think they caught the (INAUDIBLE) and they will do this. I think if they do what you were saying, they can give tax cut for the wealthy, deregulating Wall Street, repealing -- this is not why Donald Trump was elected president.
(CROSSTALK)
MATTHEWS: If they can exceed their mandate, what would be worst they can do to themselves --
RYAN: There`s not a mandate though.
MATTHEWS: How do they hurt -- well, they`ll use the word. What`s worst thing Republicans can do if they use their complete control?
BRABENDER: I think if they start with tax cut for the wealthy, I think it`s -- what I would always say to them, every vote you have, every agenda you have, think about some family in Steubenville, Ohio, who have three kids, they`re working a job and a half, and what are they talking about at their dining room table every night. If it`s something they`re not talking about, it`s the wrong agenda right now.
RYAN: They`re sworn in tomorrow. Mike Pence is coming in and going to meet with Republican House members about how to defund or repeal Obamacare. And what`s going to happen is, they are going to try to take the tax incentives which actually help pay for those who can`t afford it. And once you pull that, it breaks it apart. That`s going to -- what`s going to happen is, it`s going to cause problems for a lot of these rural hospitals or rural clinics who look to those things to help fund them. And also, it`s going to cause the insurance agencies to skyrocket.
SULLIVAN: Fourteen states with Obamacare recipients. Twelve will won by Trump. Now, that`s -- those are his voters. They are the people he relied upon. They may hate Obamacare because it had Obama attached to care.
MATTHEWS: That`s one of the great ironies of American political life, which is a lot of people desperately need government have the attitude about we don`t like the government. In the end, it`s going to matter politically.
RYAN: Appalachia loves it.
MATTHEWS: The roundtable -- well, Appalachia has always loved Meals on Wheels, and Social Security, stuff like that, the old Roosevelt programs. Anyway -- and Lyndon Johnson programs.
The roundtable is sticking with us. And up next, they`re going to tell me something I don`t know, and I`ve been away, so that won`t be hard.
This is HARDBALL, the place for politics.
MATTHEWS: Well, breaking news now. The U.S. House of Representatives will hold a vote on Thursday to condemn the United Nations Security Council resolution that called Israel`s settlements at Palestinian territory a flagrant violation of international law. That resolution passed 14-0. And the United States abstained. By the way, that passage will occur this Thursday.
We`ll be right back after this.
MATTHEWS: Back with the HARDBALL roundtable.
Andrew, first, tell me something I don`t know.
SULLIVAN: Trump and Putin`s bromance has one goal this year, and that`s to destroy the European Union and to undermine Western democracy in Western Europe, and France is the key part. Trump will be supporting the neo- fascists in France.
MATTHEWS: Oh, God.
RYAN: I told you Mike Pence went after J.C. Watts for ag. It looks like that`s not going to happen now. It looks like the ag industry wants someone that looks like them.
MATTHEWS: No. White?
RYAN: Yes.
BRABENDER: More importantly, the Super Bowl`s going to be the Pittsburgh Steelers versus the Dallas Cowboys, which when they played earlier this year, the TV ratings went through the roof and the NFL was thrilled and they`re hoping for that rematch.
MATTHEWS: You mean they set these up for the ratings?
BRABENDER: I hope so.
MATTHEWS: That`s what my dad said about the NBA. It`s always eight games -- I mean seven games. Anyway, they would like eight games.
Anyway, Andrew Sullivan, thank you, April Ryan and John Brabender.
We`ll be right back after this.
MATTHEWS: Let me finish by filling you in where I`ve been the last two weeks with Kathleen, Thomas and Caroline, two of our children.
We`ve been to India, traveling through the country by rail, by a three- wheeled car known as a tuktuk and finally by boat through the Kerala backwater. There we are.
A couple things about India. First, its long-rich history. The drawing in the Ajanta caves go back to 200 -- there they are -- 200 years before Christ. The forts we toured back to the 16th century, the time of the mogul empire over there.
It`s the present India that grabs you, though. The huge number of people, of course, 1.2 billion. And the way they get along like in traffic, they actually know how to get around each other in these crowded scenes. It`s the finesse they show in negotiating who goes first.
They use their horns to toot, to signal each other, not to blast the other guy as some kind of a nerve-rattling punishment like over here. I didn`t see any road rage anywhere in India.
Another thing about India, I know we were only there two weeks, but I couldn`t help notice the dignity of the people, even the poor people. There`s something about the way the Indian people carry themselves, men and women both.
I have a stronger, grander opinion of a country after I`ve seen where they come from. I like to see people all by themselves in the society they built. If I were an immigrant to this country from India I`d be very proud of it.
As for my family, we couldn`t have had a warmer, more generous welcome or adventurous look at that country. And, by the way, the Taj Mahal, one of the Seven Wonders of the World, is greater, more beautiful, more stunning as it stands before you than you can possibly imagine. Built by a maharajah to honor his wife, it honors not just India but civilization.
And that`s HARDBALL for now. Thanks for being with us.

"	"ARI MELBER, MSNBC`S CHIEF LEGAL CORRESPONDENT: -- I`m in for Chris Hayes and I want you to know if you like watching around this hour, Steve Kornacki will be right back here tomorrow. Now MTP Daily with Hallie Jackson starts next.
HALLIE JACKSON, MSNBC ANCHOR: If it`s Monday, Donald Trump promises a big reveal this week on Russia. Tonight, in the know--
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT-ELECT: I don`t know either. They don`t know and I don`t know. I also know things that other people don`t know. 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
JACKSON: Decoding the President-Elect`s cyber strategy and his way forward with Russia. Plus, lasting legacy. As the president tries to save Obamacare from repeal, republicans have a new plan to undo a lot more than just healthcare. And it`s all in the jeans. Why denim is hitting a political high as we welcome the New Year. This is MTP Daily, and it starts right now. Hi everyone, I`m Hallie Jackson in Washington in for Chuck who is back tomorrow. Welcome to MTP Daily. We begin tonight, the first show of the New Year with a bit of a strange question. When the President-Elect speaks on a matter of national security, do you take him seriously or literally?
What about the U.S. Intelligence community? Do they take him seriously or literally? What about congress? And what about voters? Trump is meeting with members of the intelligence community this week where he`ll be briefed on the most sensitive elements of Russia`s interference in the U.S. Election, ahead of that meeting, here`s what he said this weekend on the topic.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
TRUMP: I know a lot about hacking. And hacking is a very hard thing to prove. So it could be somebody else. And I also know things that other people don`t know, and so they cannot be sure of the situation.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Like what do you--what do you know that other people don`t know?
TRUMP: You`ll find out on Tuesday or Wednesday.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
JACKSON: So what does Donald Trump know? There`s one guy who you`d think would know, especially in that information is about to be made public as early as tomorrow. We`re talking about Donald Trump`s incoming White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer. He`s crisscrossed the airwaves in the wake of Trump`s comments, but it seems like maybe he`s not sure or maybe he doesn`t to want say.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Has he shared this information with the CIA? With the rest of the intelligence community? Because he would be talking about information that would be vital to national security if it involved the hacking of our national election. Has he shared it, and if not, is he holding it out there like some tease for a reality show?
SEAN SPICER, CHIEF STRATEGIST AND COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR, RNC: No. I think--look, the President-Elect is briefed business I had security team, by the current security team, and intelligence community. I think he does know things. That`s why he`s the President-Elect.
JACKSON: Actually, Spicer seems to think we`re talking too much about what Trump might know when we should be asking Hillary Clinton what she knows.
SPICER: Why aren`t we talking about the influence--other influences on the election? Why aren`t we talking about Hillary Clinton getting debate questions ahead of time? That`s pretty valid attempt to influence an election. No, no, no. It`s not hey. We haven`t--no one`s asking those questions. And the fact is that everyone wants to talk and make Donald Trump admit to certain things, when are we going to talk the other side of this which is what did Hillary Clinton do to influence the election? Is he being punished in any way? What are we doing to make sure people don`t get the debate questions ahead of time because I can tell you this, if my boss at the time Reince Priebus had gotten a debate questions and handed them off, he would have been driven out of this town I think if Donald Trump would have been vilified.
JACKSON: So, what does President-Elect Trump know? When did he know it? And how is that different from what the intelligence community already knows? At this point, the answer seems to be, who knows. And that is an interesting place to be. Just three days ahead of the first congressional hearing on Russian interference in the election. Top republicans on Capitol Hill seem convinced they know plenty. And some are raising the possibility of punishing Putin`s Russia with even tougher sanctions. Hawks like John McCain aren`t talking about intelligence anymore. They`re talking about potential combat.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
SENATOR JOHN MCCAIN (R), ARIZONA: When you attack a country, it`s an act of war. And so we have to make sure that there is a price to pay so that we can perhaps persuade the Russians to stop this kind of attacks on our very fundamentals of democracy.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
JACKSON: I am joined now by Ken Dilanian, intelligence and national security reporter for the NBC news investigative unit. Ken, thank you, and a lot to talk about here on this holiday Monday. You`re plugged in. What is the reaction now from the Intel community to these Donald Trump remarks that he has inside info and he`s going to share it?
KEN DILANIAN, INTELLIGENCE AND NATIONAL SECURITY REPORTER: Well, you know, it`s always dangerous to talk about the Intel community, that`s like saying the media. There`s different points of view within the community. But a lot of--I`ve talked to several people who have said, ""Look, we understand that Trump views this as an assault on the integrity of his election victory. So we`re taking it with a grain of salt all his resistance to our findings."" I mean, nobody was happy when he mentioned the CIA`s mistake in WMD in Iraq. That was a cheap shot. But, there is sort of a sense of like when he becomes the president and starts being briefed by his own people that he`ll come around on this stuff. Hallie.
JACKSON: So, ken, our unit here as you know, our team has reported that since mid-August, the President-Elect had been receiving briefings on the links between Russia and its potential interference with the U.S. election. Why does he need another briefing this week, what`s the difference?
DILANIAN: Well, you know, our reporting has suggested that these briefings have not been very detailed. The President-Elect has the opportunity to get deep dived briefings where the experts from the intelligence community come in and tell him everything there is to know about a certain topic. He--they could be combining a deep dive cyber briefing where they explain how they attribute cyber-attacks. And it`s not as simple as the forensics, as Sean Spicer and Trump himself keep saying. It isn`t about proving who hacked. Our understanding is U.S. Intelligence Community has other intelligence beyond the ones and zeros.
Human sources, communications intercepts, I mean, they`ve named specific Russian officials as being responsible for this operation. They don`t do that lightly or without evidence. Now, many people are saying they need to show some of that evidence and they say they will before Obama leaves office.
JACKSON: Okay. I take your point, Ken, that the Intel community is not one sort of monolithic blob, right? But in the folks that you`ve talked to over the last 24, 48 hours or so, is there any concern or sense of concern inside that community that the well has been poisoned basically after months of leaks, months of attacks, et cetera?
DILANIAN: Yeah, not that the well has been poisoned, but there`s definitely--there`s definitely a concern. I think a lot is going to depend on how he--whether he ultimately turns and accepts their unanimous conclusion, you know, that Russia was behind the hacking. I mean, you know, the Intel community has a long history of president`s treat them in different ways. I mean, Clinton famously ignored the CIA and the CIA director at the time, you know, couldn`t get a meeting with Clinton. Bush paid careful tension on his briefings, every president deals with the intelligence community on his own terms. And there`s still a lot of people I talked to have an open mind with Trump and I hope that he`s going to come around but there is concern with some of his comments and, you know, it isn`t every day you get a consensus view of the intelligence community. That something like this happened.
JACKSON: I`m told bay transition official, Ken, that the briefing will be with the ""full spectrum"" members of the intelligence community. Is that your sense, what do you think the President-Elect is going to hear this week that he hasn`t yet heard? You talk about perhaps more detail. Is it going to be a higher level of classification?
DILANIAN: I`m not clear about that. I mean, I think he`s already--he`s briefed with the high-- as President-Elect, he gets--he can ask any question he wants and he gets the highest level of classified briefing. But, you know, there could be more context. There could be more explanation of not just how we--how they attribute the hacking, but the communications intercepts, the full picture, the history of Russia`s involvement with hacking elections. The context, you know, this isn`t just about the forensics, it`s also about motive, means, and opportunity. If it wasn`t the Russians, I mean, Trump and his people seem to suggest, ""Hey, it could have been the Chinese masquerading as the Russians. That`s certainly possible, technical, but is it realistic? And you may hear from intelligence analysts who will talk about that.
JACKSON: Ken, quickly before I let you go, Sean Spicer in that interview we played you earlier, raises the question of the Russian hack versus the China OPM hack. Why two different public responses from the white house on those?
DILANIIAN: Well, very simply because the Chinese hack of federal personnel data was considered by officials a legitimate intelligence target. That they would have done and probably have gone after in China. The difference with this--and so by the way is hacking the DNC, if they just hacked the DNC and kept the information. The difference was the information was weaponized, it was leaked in an effort to influence the election. And that`s where U.S. Intelligence officials say Russia crossed the line.
JACKSON: So, it`s the idea to you of sort of fair game espionage if you will.
DILANIAN: Exactly. James clappe, the DNI himself said, I--something to the effect if I take my hat off to the Chinese, you know, that was a good get for them. You know, but damaging for us, but a legitimate espionage target on the OPM stuff.
JACKSON: Ken Dilanian, great perspective there, I appreciate you joining us. I want to bring in now tonight`s panel, Anne Gearan, a veteran reporter with the Washington Post, Chris Kofinis, a democratic strategist, now the CEO of Park Street Strategies, and Robert Traynham, a former Bush/Cheney advisor, now a VP with the Bipartisan Policy Center and MSNBC Contributor. Lady and gentlemen, thank you for being with us.
ROBERT TRAYNHAM, BPC VICE PRESIDENT: Happy New Year.
CHRIS KOFINIS, CEO OF PARK STREET STRATEGIES: Happy New Year.
JACKSON: Happy New Year to all of you guys.
ANNE GEARAN, THE WASHINGTON POST POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT: Happy New Year:
JACKSON: Listen, a surprising amount of things to talk about today.
GEARAN: If you will
JACKSON: I know, okay, I want to start with the Russia interference in U.S. Election and the news from our NBC/Wall Street Journal poll that only 29% of republicans and we can pull it up here are bothered a great deal or quite a bit by Russia`s interference in the election. So like, fewer than one in three republicans here. How hard are Capitol Hill republicans going to fight on this issue given where their bases is if they are in fact more concerned about it? And we have heard concern from republicans on Capitol Hill?
GEARAN: I mean, I think there`s actually something of a crisis of faith among a lot of congressional republicans on this point. I mean, here is something that has been taken as absolute gospel by--for conservative national security republicans. That, you know, Russia is not to be trusted. Russia is not our friend, and that there is a long history of tit for tat of mutual spying and all the sudden the leader of their party, the President-Elect of the United States is saying things that make them uncomfortable.
And I`m thinking of the John McCain and Lindsey Graham and--right, exactly. And they are saying so publicly that this makes them uncomfortable. But what do they do with that? How certainly the--this hearing this week is going--their--promises to be a full board investigative hearing where they will go hard at the evidence. What do they do with it afterward?
TRAYNHAM: What`s concerning about this is that the poll (INAUDIBLE) partisan because it obviously has republicans and democrats. The real question is this, Americans being frustrated and very concerned about what the Russians allegedly did. The good thing about this is that senators hopefully have the long view regardless of what your partisan affiliation is. Is that they will get to the bottom of this because this is a threat allegedly to our democracy and to who we are as a country. I don`t care whether or not you`re a republican or democrat. I care that you`re an American and that you care about our democratic system and things allegedly got hacked.
JACKSON: So you believe just--the Capitol Hill, members of congress are going to push this, they`re going to push this investigation, despite perhaps maybe a lack of an outcry from, for example, republicans and the rest of the country.
KOFINIS: Well, l I think they`re going to push it because I think it goes- -it goes to their own personal preference for these issues. I think the problem here for establishment republicans, you know, when you`re talking about John McCain and others like him, is I`m not sure they have yet and we`re all going to find out here in about a few weeks, the Trump reality. And the Trump reality is he is not going to shy away from challenging people in his own party. It is how he became the nominee.
TRAYNHAM: But Chris, it doesn`t matter.
KOFINIS: It is--I--no, I agree with you. And I`m not questioning that we shouldn`t be doing this. And I under-- and I personally believe this is a serious issue that needs to be addressed. I`m looking at it from the politics of it too which is to the poll question, I think where the republicans are going to be in a box here is as much as they`re unified in terms of the control all the chambers and the white house, there is divided as ever in some respects because they have someone in the White House who is going to look at the same facts that they`re going to look at and come to a completely different conclusion. That has not happened before.
JACKSON: Anne. So, I mean, that`s exactly what I mean. You--this hearing could result in a finding, essentially a congressional finding won`t be like a, you know, written determination, but the evidence presented at the hearing and the way congress approaches is that agrees with the intelligence community unanimously that this broad and targeted hacking happened in a different way than has happened in any previous election where the information was selectively leaked and essentially as you say weaponized. And then what? Then you have a republican-led congress, agreeing with the intelligence community and we do not yet know what the republican president will do with that information.
KOFINIS: And then--and then think about it, you know, over the next four years. Think of the potential foreign policy crisis that we may have. That we may need to get involved that effect America`s national interest. Where the intelligence community is saying one thing and the president of the United States is simply choosing to ignore it. All right. Where you create this battle between republicans and democrats in congress saying one thing. The intelligence community saying another. And the president of the United States saying, ""I just don`t agree.""
JACKSON: So you heard Sean Spicer is going to be pressed about this, not just yesterday, but today as well. This morning in the today show on our network elsewhere. I want to play a little bit what have he said. We played it earlier but I`ve got to replay it again and I want you to listen to the comparison he makes here. Play it.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
SPICER: Why aren`t we talking about the influence--other influences on the election? Why aren`t we talking about Hillary Clinton getting debate questions ahead of time? That`s pretty valid attempt to influence an election.
JACKSON: Chris, your head was in your hand as I was playing--
TRAYNHAM: This is what he recovers.
JACKSON: But is that the (INAUDIBLE)
TRAYNHAM: Of course not. Of course. Here is--here e is what we know. We know that WikiLeaks got the information from a Russian hack with the DNC. We know that, okay? So, to suggest and Sean is my dear friend. I`ve worked for him with many, many years but to suggest that a planted question by a CNN Analyst that went to secretary Clinton is on the same level as trying to influence a national election, it`s like me comparing--
JACKSON: For an hour.
TRAYNHAM: It`s like--it`s like me comparing, you know--I can`t even come up with a comparison. It`s ridiculous and laughable, but it`s also very, very sad.
KOSINIS: Well, I mean, listen, I, you know, Sean Spicer is clearly trying to spin his way out of a fundamental PR problem.
JACKSON: Or making a media argument, right? Like a media--
KOSINIS: (INAUDIBLE) but here`s the--here`s the real simple reality. Hillary Clinton lost. It is over, right? Whatever happened in the election is done. In terms of what they think influenced or didn`t influence on the democratic side.
TRAYNHAM: It didn`t help.
KOFINIS: Yeah, no joke. The question here is, you have clear Russian influence according to the intelligence agencies in an American election. What are we going to do about it? If the question is nothing, then we sit as a nation, forget about politics, forget about partisanship. We set a dangerous precedent going forward.
JACKSON: We have a ton more to talk about and we are out of time in this segment which is why I`m making you hang out the later of the show. So thank you. We`ll be back with Anne, Chris, and Robert. I appreciate it. You should stay with us too because coming up, we`re going to turn to international events now. An update on the manhunt for the gunman in this weekend`s attack in Istanbul. Plus a closer look at the investigation and possible connection to terror groups. Stay tuned.
JACKSON: --hits the ground running when it gets back in the session tomorrow when he gets back in the session tomorrow. President Obama makes a trip to the hill Wednesday for a strategy session with democrats and how to protect Obamacare and by the way, we learned late this afternoon, Vice President-Elect Mike Pence set to meet with house republicans the same day. And of course, the senate is gearing up for those big battles over Trump`s cabinet nominations. We`ve got more MTP Daily in 60 seconds.
JACKSON: Welcome back. The manhunt for a terrorist who opened fire on a nightclub in Istanbul, Turkey, continues right now. 39 people were killed in that attack. Dozens more hurt. It started in the early hours of New Year`s Day when a gunman shot his way past security and into the nightclub. ISIS claimed responsibility for the attack in a statement today, but there`s no indication about whether the group orchestrated or directed the shooting. Police are trying to identify this person, right here.
The suspect. From photos taken from security footage. Turkish police release these images via Turkish media and investigators think they have his fingerprints. Eight people have been held in connection with this investigation, but the search for this is still happening right now. NBC`s Richard Engel has the latest from Istanbul.
RICHARD ENGEL, NBC CORRESPONDENT: Hallie, Turkish officials say they are getting very close to identifying this gunman. The question is, finding him. Throughout the day, Turkish media have been broadcasting increasingly clear images, also video. They show him clean shaven, but we don`t know anything about him, where he`s from. Only the claim that he was an ISIS fighter. ISIS through its official media channel say that he was one of their soldiers of the brave caliphate. But, what we saw and what we heard from survivors of this attack was that it was anything from brave.
The gunman was running through this club shooting people, some of whom were already on the ground pretending to be dead. Witnesses said that the gunman was going up to people on the ground, shooting them as they lay, moving to the next one, shooting them. We spoke to an American who was hiding under a table. His legs sticking out, the gunman actually was on top of the bench, and was shooting down, shot him in the leg, and this American, Jake Raak who`s--who was suffering from a gunshot wound when we spoke to him and he`s now on his way back to the United States, said, even after he was shot, he had to pretend that nothing had happened.
Because he didn`t to want scream, he didn`t to want flnch so that he didn`t give himself away to the gunman. Horrific stories, 39 dead, 27 of those foreign nationals, tourists from primarily the Middle East but really all over the world.This country is--I wouldn`t say in shock however, people here are increasingly angry. Angry that terrorism is becoming common place. Terrorism coming from ISIS as it appears to have been in this case. Terrorism coming from Kurdish militants. Also, a crackdown from the government against the opposition. So people in turkey are feeling that maybe at their wit`s end, they don`t feel safe, they don`t feel safe to protest, they don`t feel safe to speak. It is really, Hallie, a very dark period for this--for this country.
JACKSON: Dark and certainly terrifying for so many people. Thank you, Richard. I want to bring in now former U.S. Special Ops Intelligence Officer and NBC Terror Analyst, Malcolm Nance. Malcolm, thanks for joining us. Let`s start with this manhunt. What are the chances this guy`s still in Turkey?
MALCOLM NANCE, NBC TERROR ANALYST: Well the chances are pretty good that he`s still in Turkey. Turkey is set quite a tight perimeter these days on the Turkish/Syrian border ever since their forces supported operations inside of Syria. It`s very interesting, right after--a few hours after the manhunt began, there were journalists inside of Turkey who were noting there were no checkpoints anywhere around Istanbul leading out of the city to other major cities and even to the east where it`s pretty much a hinterland.
So, the Turkish effort is now concentrated on putting this person`s image out to the public. He appears to be--was Pakistan or Kyrgyzstani origin, the same type of origin of the attackers who attacked the airport in Istanbul earlier in 2016. So, they hope that that will get them this man in the manhunt.
JACKSON: So it`s all gets through what a manhunt looks like, right? At this point after the attack, a day, day and a half after something like this were to happen. Is it just, you know, you assume they`re just sort of all hands on deck spread everybody out.
NANCE : Well that depends on which jurisdiction you`re in and who`s got control of it. Here in the United States, yeah, that`s what we would do. We would have state police, local police throwing out these rings of steal, the rings of manpower. However, we did notice that Turkey and the United States appeared to have had some intelligence indicators that an attack of this capacity was going happen.
And within hours of this attack, Turkish police actually worked their way back to eight accomplices of this person. Which means that they may have had some sort of electronic intelligence indicating where this originated but not the name of the individual. That person got out, carried out the attack and now they`re probably trying to run down those leads based on what information they had prior to the attack.
JACKSON: You heard my colleague Richard Engel just couple of moments ago say this is scary for people in Turkey but necessarily surprising. They`ve had a dozen terror attacks in the past year. ISIS as you know has made calls to target the country. So, what do Turkish authorities need to do now to try to bolster security or give some measure of reassurance to people there after what you`re seeing on your screen. This laundry list of terrifying attacks?
NANCE: Well, people that I know in Istanbul over the last year, after every attack, I call my associates in Istanbul and Ankara and they`re frustrated. They`re frustrated, one, because for a few years, the government of Turkey, Erdogan, allowed ISIS to infiltrate and not even infiltrate to allow thousands and thousands of people to come into Turkey legally, than cross the border and go in there and provide manpower to the Islamic state. And they were making money off of the refugees who were coming out by profiting, you know, them coming in, selling them food stuffs and getting them on boats.
So they`re very frustrated because it`s a problem of their own making. Is has little bastions in the major cities of Istanbul, Ankara, Gaziantep . Places like that. And they`re very well-known. However, the Turkish have been emphasizing intelligence, but on the other hand, whenever they have a terrorist act of this magnitude, they tend to use it as political cagle to go after their opposition inside of Turkey.
JACKSON: Malcom Nance, thank you for that perspective and for being here to talk us through this. I appreciate it.
NANCE: It`s always a pleasure.
JACKSON: Still ahead--sure thing. Still ahead this New Year. New questions about the President-Elect`s potential conflicts of interest in office. We`re going to take a look at the latest international issue making headlines. Stay tuned.
JACKSON: Welcome back. My fellow road warriors traveled tens of thousands of miles covering the presidential election but we were not the only NBC news reporters on the road covering the 2016 campaign. We couldn`t have done it without our embeds. An incredible group of young journalist who covered all of the candidates who were running for president, all of the time in all of the states where they were running. It was quite literally a 24/7 job. So now that we`ve had a chance to get a little bit of sleep, we asked our embeds to reflect a little bit on their journey through 2016. Take a look.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
JORDAN FRASIER, 2016 CAMPAIGN EMBED: The hardest part about the campaign in so many ways is that it`s sensory overload from morning to night, there is just so much information coming at you.
ALEX JAFFE, 2016 CAMPAIGN EMBED: It was non-stop for seven days, a different city every night, sometimes three different cities every day.
KAILANI KOENIG, MSNBC REPORTER: One of the things I liked best about the campaign trail was watching candidates get grilled by voters in places like New Hampshire where people would just be able to walk right up to them and ask them the most pressing questions of their lives.
DANNY FREEMAN, MSNBC REPORTER: The kindness of Iowa voters was one of my favorite parts about the campaign trail. There was one time I remember, I was at the Iowa state fair, very much lost and confused, and a farmer came up to me and showed me around. Helped me understand where I was inside the big barn at the time, and he said, I want to do this for you because I hope if my son ever goes to New York, someone will be kind enough to do the same for him.
ALI VITALI, MSNBC PRODUCER: My most memorable interaction with Donald Trump was when I was taken into the buffer area around the stage over a rally during Christmas, and asked to shoot cuts of the candidate up close which is a normal piece of being an embed on the campaign trail.
And as I got up there, I was holding my camera and Donald Trump in the middle of his speech turned and pointed to me and said.
DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT-ELECT OF THE UNITED STATES: Look, here we have NBC, they`re supposed to be back there, but that`s OK.
VITALI: That was probably the most memorable and definitely the most bizarre interaction.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: One of my favorite moments from the campaign trail happened in New Hampshire as Governor Bush was on a bus tour, and it was in the middle of a snowstorm. And I`m outside the bus with my camera raised, ready to film him. And as he`s walking by me, he bends down and forms a snowball and throws it at me and gets this big laugh out of it. It was this moment that I`ll always remember his personality really shining through.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You can`t do anything about it.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: No.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: That`s not fair actually.
VAUGHN HILLYARD, MSNBC REPORTER: The night that Mike Pence`s plane goes off the runway, New York City, La Guardia Airport, rain coming down, the plane lands, it veers, you kind of smell the rubber come up. And it`s one of those moments where it`s still like, you`ve still got a job to do. You pick up the camera. You have to start filming. And you realize, you can`t believe this is happening.
SHAQUILLE BREWSTER, NBC NEWS REPORTER: Having a roomful of voters who are there to see Dr. Carson at a campaign event in Iowa, a break out in a happy birthday song for me at a staffer`s direction. It was one of the most memorable moments on the campaign. You know, you`re going so many places and sometimes you`re giving up your birthday and you know, that really just made it special.
MONICA ALBA, NBC NEWS REPORTER: This was absolutely the best year and a half of my life, both professionally and personally. And I think what will make it so special is that I probably will never do it again. At least not this way.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
HALLIE JACKSON, MSNBC HOST: Welcome back to MTP Daily.
Donald Trump will be sworn in as president in 18 days. But before then, he said he`d hold a press conference to answer questions on how he`ll untangle himself from his big business empire which includes extensive and unprecedented dealings all over the world.
All of it leading to potentially countless conflicts of interest. It all came up again over the weekend when we learned guests at a New Year`s Eve party attended by Donald Trump and his family paid more than $500 each to ring in 2017 with the president-elect.
And the New York Times, did you see this, reporting now two Trump projects in Indonesia are moving forward, even though he promised no new deals while he`s in office.
The president-elect has repeatedly pointed out that federal conflict of interest laws do not apply to the president and he`s right, but international deals like the ones in Indonesia could violate the Constitution from the very second that Donald Trump is sworn in.
Joining me now to talk about all of this, Richard Painter and Norman Eisen, they were both chief ethics lawyers in the White House. Richard served under President George W. Bush, Norm under President Obama, they`ve written -- done talks and speeches about Trump`s conflicts extensively since election day pushing the president-elect to divest completely from his business.
And you guys have a new paper out published up on Bookings, I believe too. Norm, I want to start with you. You said the president-elect is basically cording disaster here with his businesses, 18 days away from becoming president. It is fairly clear he has not going to fully divest, right? So, is Congress obligated to hold him accountable here?
NORMAN EISEN, FORMER WHITE HOUSE ETHICS LAWYER: Well, Congress is obligated, the courts are obligated, Hallie, your profession, journalism is obligated, and all of us as American citizens are obligated to do all we can, because the president-elect is on a collision course with corruption.
This is not just a matter of what looks or smells good. And it doesn`t look good. It doesn`t smell good. It is the Constitution. There`s a constitutional conflicts cause. Though...
(CROSSTALK)
JACKSON: The Emolument Clause.
EISEN: The Emolument Clause, it`s just a fancy 18th century word, all it means is no foreign government money, cash, or other benefits to an American president. He`s collecting those all over the world.
JACKSON: So, let me just to clarify this here, to sort of explain this, right? If he hands over his business as expected to Donald Trump Jr., to Eric Trump, his sons, if Ivanka Trump removes herself from her brand and the president-elect says I`m not going deal with it for the next at least four years, that doesn`t satisfy you?
EISEN: It does not. It is a break with what presidents with far lesser conflicts have done for the past four decades. They go to a trustee, an independent trustee, not a family member, they turn over ownership interests to be liquidated, to be sold. Donald Trump has much more profound conflicts issue. It`s going to put a paw all over everything he does. He`s got to divest.
JACKSON: Richard, I want to play something, President-elect Trump said last week at Mar-a-Lago. I want to play this and I want to get your response on the other side.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
TRUMP: It`s a much bigger business than anybody thought. It`s a great business. But, I`m going to have nothing to do with it. I`m going to just - - I don`t have to because as you know, I wouldn`t have to do that by law. I want to do that because I want to focus on the country. It`s actually a very simple situation. It`s not a big deal.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
JACKSON: So, Richard, he`s going to have nothing to do with it, it`s simple, the end. Case closed, right?
RICHARD PAINTER, FORMER WHITE HOUSE ETHICS LAWYER: Well, he`s going to own it. And if it owns it, he has a conflict of interest because of it. Including the foreign government, moneys that comes in a violation of the Constitution.
So, the only way to solve that problem is for him to divest, and so far we`re not hearing about that. We`re just hearing about new business deals in Indonesia and everywhere else. And as for Congress they`re showing no interest in monitoring the president`s conflicts of interest. Indeed, they`re just going to make their own conflicts of interest worse.
The latest news we`re hearing now is they want to take the office of congressional ethics which has some independents.
JACKSON: Yes.
PAINTER: And rain in its independence and put under the House ethics committee which I call the Fox in charge of it chicken coup committee and the American taxpayers are the chickens here.
You know, this is a situation that has become absurd. When members of Congress are just saying, well, me too on the conflicts of interest, I want my own rather than reigning in the president-elect and letting him know that both members of Congress and the president as elected officials, hold positions of trust where they must be free of conflicts of interest.
We need independent ethics oversight. Both executive branch and the Congress. And we see that our elected officials are moving at exactly the opposite direction. And they`re not serving the American people at all with this kind of attitude.
JACKSON: Richard, I want to go back on the Emolument Clause. But I want to get Norm to kind of set it up for us here first. Because these projects of the New York Times is waiting about in Indonesia, elsewhere. Moving forward, is that in violation of this clause in your view?
EISEN: Hallie, not only in my view, but the founders of our country and the framers of the Constitution had exactly this situation in mind. They saw in the time of the Constitution, in the 17th and 18th and 19th centuries, it was very common for foreign sovereigns to try to give things of value to American and other elected officials to get them to favor the interests of the foreign sovereigns. So these...
(CROSSTALK)
JACKSON: But Donald Trump could say well, I have nothing to do with my businesses now, right?
EISEN: Well, but it doesn`t seem like he`s headed in that direction because he`s resisting turning over the ownership interests. Doing what all the other presidents have done for the past four decades so people all over the world will see, hey, when -- and diplomats are saying it. They`re going to his new hotel and they`re saying to reporters, of course I want to tell the president when I see him, what a great hotel you have.
JACKSON: Richard, it`s not just the Emolument Clause though, talk about the perception, even just the appearance of a conflict of interest with foreign leaders. He can say, you know, I`m not going to have a conflict, but will that create lasting damage internationally, potentially from a perception standpoint?
PAINTER: Well, of course it could. And it could also be a global strategic risk when you have the president of the United States have properties and business deals all over the world and countries that are undergoing a lot of difficulty where the important United States strategic interests and there could be terrorist attacks.
We had a president`s name up on a building. That`s an invitation to an attack. There are lots of problems here that need to be addressed. And thus far, we`re seeing that the president-elect is not addressing them, and the members of Congress are just busy feathering their own nests rather than focusing on congressional oversight of executive branch.
So, unless things change quickly we`re going to have a lot more than bad perception. We`re going to have bad policy and potentially a strategic national security risk for the United States because of this.
JACKSON: OK. So, Richard, what should Congress do? What do you recommend?
PAINTER: Well, first, the Congress ought to make sure that their playing by the rules in their hand instead of retreating from independent ethics oversight of the members of Congress. Second, the house oversight committee which was very interested, of course, in spending hours and hours going through Hillary Clinton`s e-mails ought to continue it supervision of ethics and executive branch.
And in fact, that the executive branch is controlled by the same political party as controls the Congress shouldn`t mean that the House oversight committee says, well, we`re just not going to worry about, the fact that the president is just receiving unconstitutional payoffs from foreign governments. Or if other people in the executive branch are misbehaving.
JACKSON: All right.
PAINTER: It`s up to Congress to do its job of congressional oversight of the executive branch.
JACKSON: OK. So, Norm, is Donald Trump doing anything right? Is the Trump family doing anything that you see as a positive. I think back to that fundraiser issue that came up a few weeks ago and Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr. removed from it. The transition officials will say hey, we`re working on it basically.
EISEN: There have been some positive signs, the procrastination. There have been several times now where the president-elect said I`m going to make an announcement. He has, and he`s putting it off, he sees how hard it is. There is some unwinding of foreign deals as of Brazil, the republic of Georgia, they have taken down some of these auctions of access to get access to the family.
Baby steps, Hallie. We need a giant leap. I want to give a shout out to one other congressional effort. Senator Warren has announced that this week she and her democratic colleagues in the Senate are going to put in a bill requiring the president to do a blind trust, putting teeth into the Emolument Clause making clear what it means, the kinds of benefits we`re talking about.
So there are some in the Senate who are taking some positive steps as well. But on the other hand, then you hear that the House wants the House leadership wants to go...
(CROSSTALK)
JACKSON: The IOCE...
EISEN: They are independent office of congressional ethics. It`s like a cancer that is starting to spread. We don`t have to follow ethics rules. It`s the opposite of the Obama approach. It`s very worrying.
JACKSON: Norman Eisen and Richard Painter, a very spirited conversation as always. Thank you both for being with us.
EISEN: Thanks, Hallie. Happy New Year.
JACKSON: Happy New Year, too.
PAINTER: Thank you.
JACKSON: But still ahead, President Obama will spend his final days in office trying to protect the legacy of the past eight years. So could he and the democrats really save Obamacare? Stay tuned.
JACKSON: Welcome back. President Obama announced he`s going to be delivering that farewell address a week from tomorrow in his hometown of Chicago. Saying in the e-mail, he wants to say thanks to the American people and offer some thoughts on where to go from here.
Up next, in the lid we`re taking a look at how the president and democrats will be working to cement his legacy in those final 18 days in office. Keep it here.
JACKSON: Welcome back. It is time for the lid. President Obama making a rare trip to Capitol Hill later this week to meet with House and Senate democrats. The focus, the future of his signature Affordable Care Act and how to keep republicans from repealing it.
Meanwhile, the republican-led Congress is planning to try to roll back more than just the health care law. Even of that of course is at the center of the republican legislative target. But when the 115th Congress begins tomorrow, they`re expecting to take up two bills that would give Congress more control over regulations including the ability to repeal some rules put in place by President Obama.
Our esteemed panel is back with me now, Anne Gearan, Chris Kofinis, Robert Traynham. Thank you very much. Let`s start with the discussion about the Affordable Care Act. There`s a lot of action this week, right. You`ve got Wednesday the president heading to the Hill. And by the way, Mike Pence on the same day, the big liaison to members of Congress.
I would ask what kind of deals the democrats would need to make in order to make sure the Affordable Care Act doesn`t get repealed. It`s not even possible though, is it, Chris? I mean, this thing it`s a matter of when not if.
CHRIS KOFINIS, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST: It depends on how the republicans try to do it and what`s their strategy. If there`s an argument that can try to do this through budget reconciliation.
JACKSON: Right.
KOFINIS: That allow them only and would require 51 votes. Otherwise, they may try to do in a different legislative way, it could require 60 which then allows the democrats to filibuster it.
Politically, I think the problem for republicans is clearly, they are clearly going to push to try to repeal it. But there are -- there are aspects of the Obamacare act for obvious reasons have incredible appeal for people, in particular this, you know, this pre-existing conditions, portions, you know, providing young people to be on their parent`s health care.
JACKSON: Right.
KOFINIS: You start going after that you now create a political problem that I`m not sure they fully appreciate until you see some mother talking about her child who has cancer and now their inability to have health care.
JACKSON: But is that an overly optimistic view in your view?
ROBERT TRAYNHAM, FORMER GEORGE BUSH SENIOR ADVISOR: Yes. I mean, let me just talk this back for a second. So, yes, it will probably through reconciliation. That`s all my sources are telling me that. But what I also think is that what they are probably going to do is would symbolically vote to repeal this.
KOFINIS: Again?
TRAYNHAM: But they`re not going to replace it. But they`re not going to replace it with anything. In other words, they`ll just vote and just with straight face is they actually voted to repeal. They may be is trying to win it with a divide -- when they`re divided.
But there`s one thing that`s really important that we never talk about and that is how high the premiums are for many, many Americans out there. There are tens of thousands, Chris, and you can`t deny this of Americans that got their premium bills the week before the election who said, oh, my goodness, this is something I cannot afford.
JACKSON: But can they realistically repeal it and not put anything out to replace it fundamentally?
ANNE GEARAN, CORRESPONDENT, THE WASHINGTON POST: I mean, I think there`s a real practical problem here, which is those popular elements then would have to be reenacted.
JACKSON: Elements of the president-elect have acknowledged that he likes.
TRAYNHAM: Exactly, which is part of the bill.
GEARAN: Right. I mean, so he can take credit for him. He can go ahead and do it over again. I suppose that there has to be a mechanical process that takes time, and I think would be sort of a giant, you know, pain in the neck for the new Congress but they probably don`t want to take on.
KOFINIS: To me the key political question is, do the republicans now that they control basically all leaders of government. Do they want to go to war, right? Or do they actually want to try to make government work, right? And that is, you know, that is I think is a really important distinction.
Because if they decide to go to war on this then what you`re going to see is basically everything that the American people hated in a lot of respect between the dysfunction between the two parties is going to continue.
If they actually want to try to solve some of the issues with Obamacare that even democrats admit there are.
TRAYNHAM: Right.
KOFINIS: Then I think we can actually have something productive. I`m just not convince that that is where they are going. I think this is much more ideological, much more political than it is about solving or creating good policy.
JACKSON: So, it`s not about the Affordable Care Act, right, because you are seeing and the president-elect in that video that just came out today speaking at New Year`s Eve said he wants to, you know, enroll that these regulations, he`s going to do a lot of it through executive orders, some of it Congress will do as we were just talking about during the break, you called the kabuki theater a little bit, putting regulations in place and then rolling them back right away.
TRAYNHAM: This is what happens every time with the new president, an incoming president especially...
(CROSSTALK)
JACKSON: This is business as usual then. I mean, this is...
GEARAN: Well, except on immigration. Right, I mean, here`s another huge field of battle and we just don`t know how that is going to play out, make a...
(CROSSTALK)
JACKSON: With the political appetite for that.
GEARAN: Right, exactly. I mean, Trump can undo the executive -- Obama executive orders very quickly but then what.
TRAYNHAM: But this is about putting the president-elect or any incoming president-elect on the defense. So, in other words, if President Obama with a sign of a pen could put millions of acres and put it into protective wildlife preserve do you want a new president to undo that.
So, in other words, there`s a lot about President Obama for his own legacy purposes. I get that. But it`s also to my point about really making people on the defenses they are going to the White House.
KOFINIS: I think what`s going to be really interesting to watch over the next many months and years is usually -- and you saw this with President Bush. You know, President Bush kind of went away, right, when President Obama came in. He wasn`t out there, he wasn`t making comments. He really wasn`t engaging or being critical in any way, shape or form. I do not believe you are going to see the same thing from President Obama.
JACKSON: He did just say though, that he was just going to maybe stay silent, right? And only speak on the big moment.
KOFINIS: I do not -- I don`t believe that for a moment and probably because there`s no other...
(CROSSTALK)
GEARAN: Right.
KOFINIS: But there`s no other leader we have to his level in the Democratic Party right now. He is it.
TRAYNHAM: What President Clinton has said and also what President Obama has said, they were on the record, they are saying is that they were given space to be able to govern the country as they see fit.
And what I mean by that is that President Clinton ironically said President Bush, meaning his predecessor was fairly quiet. President Obama said quote, ""I want to go somewhere warm and drink out of a coconut for a couple of months. I suspect that he`s probably going to speak out or we just look in his eyes, I suspect he`s probably going to speak out for Black Lives Matter.
JACKSON: Criminal justice system.
TRAYNHAM: And criminal justice issues. However, if in fact his signature issue, the Affordable Care Act is jeopardize or threatened I think thoughtfully he may say something, but I don`t envision him going out and...
(CROSSTALK)
KOFINIS: I don`t think the president...
JACKSON: There is a lot of pressure on him to do so.
TRAYNHAM: Yes, exactly.
JACKSON: Well, I mean, to your point, I mean, he is the...
TRAYNHAM: Well, there`s a lot of pressure -- well, there`s a lot of -- go ahead.
KOFIIS: I just don`t believe that given where the Democratic Party is right now and the need for a real powerful voice that here you have an incredible dynamic charismatic and popular president who is simply just going to go away. I don`t think that`s going to happen.
JACKSON: All right. Anne Gearan, Chris Kofinis, and Robert Traynham, thank you, guys so much for hanging out.
(CROSSTALK)
TRAYNHAM: Thank you. Happy New Year.
JACKSON: Happy New Year. I appreciate it. We`ll see you back here sometime soon. After the break we`re bringing in the new year with some new laws. Stay tuned.
JACKSON: (AUDIO GAP) New Year means new laws. In addition to big changes like minimum wage hike in 20 states, and new gun laws in multiple states. Here are some other new rules in the book you may have missed.
In California, the official state fabric is now denim. Legally, it`s not much you need to know about it. Crimes of fashion have the same punishment as in 2016. But, hey, useful piece of trivia if nothing else.
In Illinois, you can now legally catch a catfish with a spear gun or a pitch forks or a bow and arrow. And if you do post it to YouTube immediately so I can watch it.
And something every good road warrior should know. People in Ohio can now drive their golf carts on roads where the speed limit is 35 miles per hour or less. But there is a catch. It has to be a tricked out golf car. You got to have turn signal, tail lights, or windshield or horn. It could be fun to take on the golf course, as well.
And in Pennsylvania now freeing the six pack, meaning it`s starting in a couple of weeks, beer can be sold in any quantity. Get your growlers ready, and by the way, our cameraman giving thumbs up right now.
In Tennessee it`s not how much beer you`re buying but how strong it is. Tennessee brewers can make higher alcohol content beers without special license for it, so clearly rounding out my bucket list for the year. Spear catfish in Illinois from a tricked out golf cart while wearing a pair of jeans from Cali before celebrating with a single extra strong beer bought in Pennsylvania but brewed in Nashville.
That is it for us tonight. Chuck is back tomorrow with more MTP Daily. Right now, my colleague Ayman Mohyeldin picking up our coverage from 30 Rock.
